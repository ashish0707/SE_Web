<p>Though the history of the co-operative movement in the UK is often traced back to the <a href="/wiki/Rochdale_Pioneers" class="mw-redirect" title="Rochdale Pioneers">Rochdale Pioneers</a> of 1844, the history of co-operation can be traced back much further. The origins of modern co-operatives owe their beginnings not simply to the extreme poverty faced by many in the 18th and 19th centuries, but also to the rapid social changes of urbanisation, the rising food prices which resulted from the marketisation of the economy and from the lack of political representation for the working class during this period. These factors led to a number of social changes including an increased focus on mutual businesses (notably co-operatives) in public discourse during this time and also to events such as the <a href="/wiki/Swing_Riots" title="Swing Riots">Swing Riots</a> of 1830.<sup id="cite_ref-Building_Co-operation_2013_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Building_Co-operation_2013-4">[4]</a></sup> Early co-ops often focused on the provision of essential services (notably food) to members where the market was either unable to provide these services sufficiently or was considered unjust. Often the more successful co-ops were established around the trades which were experiencing the largest impact from the rapid industrialisation such as mining and weaving. This was likely due to the clearer direct benefits of membership and the solidarity of workers with a similar plight. The provision of food was a highly successful area for co-ops with many becoming involved in milling and baking bread. The Hull Anti-Mill Co-op, established in 1795 and which traded for a century, provides an example of such a successful society.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Though many co-operative societies had been established by the 1840s many had not been successful with societies often suffering through financial maladministration or fraud owing to the very limited legislation surrounding such enterprises. During the boom times, when work in the factories was more fruitful, co-operative societies also had difficulty encouraging people to retain their membership owing to perception of its limited financial benefits. It became understood that some kind of economic benefit for membership was required alongside the educational and social benefits. It was the implementation of the <a href="/wiki/Patronage_dividend" class="mw-redirect" title="Patronage dividend">patronage dividend</a> and the formalisation of the <a href="/wiki/Rochdale_Principles" title="Rochdale Principles">Rochdale Principles</a> which led to the success of the <a href="/wiki/Rochdale_Society_of_Equitable_Pioneers" title="Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers">Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers</a> which was established in December 1844, a business which continues to this day as a part of <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">The Co-operative Group</a>. The Rochdale Pioneers society became highly successful with 1,400 members in 1855 and the co-op expanded further, after opening additional stores, to have 5,560 members by 1870. This success encouraged a boom in co-operatives in the following decades across the UK, but predominately across the industrial heartlands of northern England.<sup id="cite_ref-Building_Co-operation_2013_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Building_Co-operation_2013-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>By 1860 there were more than 200 co-ops in the north west of England which were running in a similar manner to the Rochdale society. Private shopkeepers became resentful of the competition which they were experiencing from these new co-operative stores, often as they saw the dividend as an unfair competitive advantage, and so some powerful shopkeepers lobbied for wholesalers to stop supplying these new co-operative societies. Though few such boycotts actually occurred, this threat worried many people in the co-operative movement and so they endeavoured to create a co-operative wholesaler to supply at least some key products to co-operative stores. The <a href="/w/index.php?title=Industrial_and_Provident_Societies_Act_1862&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1862 (page does not exist)">Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1862</a> enabled co-operative societies to invest in other co-operative societies, in effect permitting <a href="/wiki/Co-operative_federation" class="mw-redirect" title="Co-operative federation">co-operative federations</a>. Following this the North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited, later renamed the <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">Co-operative Wholesale Society</a> (CWS) was launched in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> by 300 individual co-operatives in <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> during 1863.<sup id="cite_ref-co-operative1_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-co-operative1-6">[6]</a></sup> The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society was founded in 1868.<sup id="cite_ref-Building_Co-operation_2013_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Building_Co-operation_2013-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/wiki/Grosmont,_North_Yorkshire" title="Grosmont, North Yorkshire">Grosmont</a> Co-operative Society remains an independent co-op store.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Many co-operatives (by convention known as co-operative societies) started out in a single village, town or city usually with just a single store. Here, members would be customers of the society's trading location and the society would reward these members with a proportion of any profits based on that member's spending with the society, or a <a href="/wiki/Dividend" title="Dividend">dividend</a>. This is a fundamental difference between a co-operative and a <a href="/wiki/Joint_stock_company" class="mw-redirect" title="Joint stock company">joint stock company</a>. Most societies were small, and by 1900, there were 1,439 co-operatives covering virtually every area of the UK.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Gradually, many societies expanded by opening further stores or by merging with a neighbouring society. Today, there is one dominant, national society, <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">The Co-operative Group</a>, and a number of large regional co-operative societies such as <a href="/wiki/Central_England_Co-operative" title="Central England Co-operative">Central England Co-operative</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Midcounties_Co-operative" title="Midcounties Co-operative">Midcounties Co-operative</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scotmid" title="Scotmid">Scotmid</a>. Many of these large co-operative societies have businesses in a number of sectors, are led by their values principles and owned by their members. Membership is open to everyone and alongside being democratically involved in the decision making of the societies, every year members receive a share of the profits based on the amount made in profits that year and the how much they had spent with any of its businesses. In the case of <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">The Co-operative Group</a>, the society has over six million members and 4,500 trading outlets for its family of business which comprises food, <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Travel" title="The Co-operative Travel">travel</a> (30% stakeholding), <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Bank" title="The Co-operative Bank">banking</a> (20% stakeholding), <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Insurance" class="mw-redirect" title="The Co-operative Insurance">insurance</a>, funeral, legal services, and <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Electrical" class="mw-redirect" title="The Co-operative Electrical">electrical products</a>. In contrast to these large regional or national societies, some have remained with a single store such as <a href="/wiki/Shepley_Co-operative_Society" title="Shepley Co-operative Society">Shepley Co-op</a>, Grosmont Co-op, Coniston Co-op and Allendale Co-op.</p>
<p>The decline, through mergers, of single shop co-operatives, was reversed by two trends. Firstly, around 170 community owned shops were established since 1979, many of which are co-operatives.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Secondly, the United States <a href="/wiki/Food_co-operative" class="mw-redirect" title="Food co-operative">food co-operative</a> movement was replicated in the UK:<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> some of the independent food co-operatives established in the late 20th and early 21st centuries operate shops.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>By 1860 there were more than 200 co-ops in the north west of England which were running in a similar manner to the Rochdale society. Private shopkeepers became resentful of the competition which they were experiencing from these new co-operative stores, often as they saw the dividend as an unfair competitive advantage, and so some powerful shopkeepers lobbied for wholesalers to stop supplying these new co-operative societies. Though few such boycotts actually occurred, this threat worried many people in the co-operative movement and so they endeavoured to create a co-operative wholesaler to supply at least some key products to co-operative stores. The North of England Co-operative Wholesale Industrial and Provident Society Limited, later renamed the <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">Co-operative Wholesale Society</a> (CWS) was launched in <a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> by 300 individual co-operatives in <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> during 1863.<sup id="cite_ref-co-operative1_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-co-operative1-6">[6]</a></sup> The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society was founded in 1868. The CWS grew rapidly and supplied produce to co-operative stores across England, competing fiercely for trade from co-operative societies with other non-co-operative wholesalers which led to the CWS becoming highly innovative. By 1890 the CWS had established significant branches in <a href="/wiki/Leeds" title="Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blackburn" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nottingham" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> and <a href="/wiki/Huddersfield" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a> alongside a number of factories which produced biscuits (<a href="/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>), Boots (<a href="/wiki/Leicester" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>), Soap (<a href="/wiki/Durham,_England" title="Durham, England">Durham</a>) and textiles (<a href="/wiki/Batley" title="Batley">Batley</a>). This rapid expansion continued so that by the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> the CWS had major offices in the United States, Denmark, Australia and a <a href="/wiki/Tea" title="Tea">tea</a> plantation in India.</p>
<p>Many, fiercely local, societies saw the CWS as a valuable supplier but did not want to exclusively purchase produce from a single source. In order to increase loyalty to the CWS, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Bank" title="The Co-operative Bank">The Co-operative Bank</a>, financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Insurance" class="mw-redirect" title="The Co-operative Insurance">Co-operative Insurance Society</a> in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Legal_Services" class="mw-redirect" title="The Co-operative Legal Services">legal services</a> – all business which remain today. It was hoped that these financial tie, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a href="/wiki/Rationing" title="Rationing">rationing</a> led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods. Following the war there was some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first self-service shop in 1942 the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Despite this the market share and the number of members of the society began to dwindle and - importantly - so did the member share capital which societies used to invest. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_brand" title="The Co-operative brand">first national co-operative branding</a>, the 'Co-op' cloverleaf. Though operation facelift led to some improvements the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing its downward trend.<sup id="cite_ref-myners_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-myners-13">[13]</a></sup> It was also suggested around this time that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through the economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or with either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.</p>
<p>The co-operative movement's market share and profitability continued to decline during the 1970s and 80s in part due to a number of reasons. Firstly the process of <a href="/wiki/De-industrialisation" class="mw-redirect" title="De-industrialisation">de-industrialisation</a> which characterised the period led to serious economic difficulties in many of the movements heartlands (notably the northern industrial towns) which disproportionally impacted on the societies through a decrease in consumer spending despite the British economy seeing a rise in consumer disposable income overall. This was largely due to the strong increase in inequality in the UK at this time and the co-operative movement was not well placed to tap into this increase in middle class spending due to the geographic spread of its stores and the co-op's historic association as the shop for the 'working poor'. Secondly redevelopment projects in many cities between the 1950s and 1970s often moved people from rows of terraced housing (which featured co-op stores dotted throughout) to newer purpose-built estates, with around 18,000 co-op stores closing as they become redundant in this way. Thirdly the time was a period of notable <a href="/wiki/Inflation" title="Inflation">inflation</a> and a strong pound which led to a wave of cheap imported goods – this devastated much of the UKs manufacturing businesses (including the CWS). By the 1980s it became clear that the trend in the retail sector was towards large (often out of town) supermarkets and <a href="/wiki/Hypermarkets" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypermarkets">hypermarkets</a> with hundreds of them appearing across the UK. The co-operative movement did build some superstores, having 74 by 1986, but often their development and competitiveness was hindered by the lack of a national distribution network and price competitiveness.</p>
<p>During the 1980s financial troubles and an increasing number of co-operative societies led to the CWS began rescuing many of these (after the CRS began to struggle financially from the number of failing co-ops that it had merged with), the CWS having returned to direct retailing after its merger with the SCWS the decade before. It was these mergers with consumers' co-operatives which led to the co-op having both corporate (co-op societies) and individual members and hence making it both a primary and <a href="/wiki/Secondary_co-operative" class="mw-redirect" title="Secondary co-operative">secondary co-operative</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-myners_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-myners-13">[13]</a></sup> The CWS's expansion into direct retailing (especially after the mergers of the 2000s) led to the CWS becoming such a highly visible business in the UK. The legacy of this was that many people consider the British co-operative movement to be one business, <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group" title="The Co-operative Group">The Co-operative Group</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Building_Co-operation_2013_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Building_Co-operation_2013-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the start of the 1990s the co-operative movement's share of the UK grocery market had declined to the point where the entire business model was under question. This was at a time where many <a href="/wiki/Building_society" title="Building society">building societies</a> were demutualising as many of the public preferred the short term financial gain of the windfall payment over the perceived lack of benefits from the mutual model. For a time it seemed as though the mutual or co-op model was almost dead – though around the <a href="/wiki/2008_financial_crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="2008 financial crisis">2008 financial crisis</a> almost all of the demutualised building societies either failed or were forced to merge with a larger bank for support reigniting much debate on the virtues of the mutual and co-op models. The co-op's reputation was not helped in this respect by the factions within the movement, notably the strong rivalry between the <a href="/wiki/Co-operative_Retail_Services" title="Co-operative Retail Services">CRS</a> and the CWS, acting in a manner which exacerbated the belief held by many members of the public that, rather than working for the interests of all members, co-ops were largely acting in the self-interests of a dominant 'clique' of members within each society. Together these crises meant that the 1990s would become a crucial decade if 'The Co-op' was to survive. In order to raise capital to invest in its food stores (and also the increasingly successful The Co-operative Bank) the CWS sold many of its factories to <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Regan" title="Andrew Regan">Andrew Regan</a> in 1994 for £111 million before in 1997 he posed a highly ambitious £1.2bn hostile takeover attempt of the CWS. This shocked many in the movement and consolidated support for the CWS as the 'linchpin' of the movement in a way that many had previous opposed. The CWS was able to defend itself from this takeover bid and after investigations by a private detective and a subsequent criminal court case, Regan's bid was rejected and two senior CWS executives were dismissed and imprisoned for fraud. An arrest warrant was issued for Andrew Regan in 1999 however he had already emigrated to <a href="/wiki/Monaco" title="Monaco">Monaco</a>.</p>
<p>The shock that Mr Regan's bid sent through the co-operative movement has been attributed with sowing the seeds for the merger of the CRS and the CWS in 1999.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The merger took two years to complete and the launch of the newly combined business, named The Co-operative Group, was timed with the release of the 2001 <a href="/wiki/Co-operative_Commission" title="Co-operative Commission">Co-operative Commission</a> report, chaired by <a href="/wiki/John_Monks" title="John Monks">John Monks</a>, which proposed a strategy of modernisation which focused on improving store design and building a consistent <a href="/wiki/The_Co-operative_brand" title="The Co-operative brand">branding</a> whilst also driving for efficiency savings to make the food business more competitive - the similarity in conclusions between the 1919, 1958 and 2001 reports highlights the distinct lack of progress within the movement during this time. The 2001 report also highlighted the need to market what it called 'The Co-operative Advantage' which suggested that commercial success would provide the funding for the social goals of the movement which (when the public saw a tangible benefit to their own lives) would provide a competitive advantage to the co-op which would further its commercial success - a virtuous cycle. Unlike Gaitskell Commission's 1958 report the recommendations of the report, notably the major update to "The Co-operative brand" and the re-launch of the membership dividend scheme, were largely adopted by the co-operative movement including The Co-operative Group. These changes to the business are largely credited with the successes in profitability and the achievement in social goals which improved in the years after the Co-operative Commission report.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is not to say that modernisation of the CWS had not been under way for some time. Since 1993 the CRTG had been working to switch the role of the CWS from 'selling to' to 'buying for' co-operative societies as a way of maximising the economies of scale to become more competitive to the major supermarkets. Since the 1960s the co-op had been following retail trends after they had occurred, always having to catch up, in a way that it led the changes before World War II. Many leaders in the movement began to appreciate that this 'me too' approach to retailing was not working, for example expanding into <a href="/wiki/Hypermarkets" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypermarkets">hypermarkets</a> after <a href="/wiki/Tesco" title="Tesco">Tesco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sainsburys" class="mw-redirect" title="Sainsburys">Sainsburys</a> had already developed a dominant position but without the resources to compete on price. As an attempt to differentiate itself from its larger competitors The Co-operative Bank had introduced an ethical policy in 1992 and this, along with its technical innovation, was well received with customers. The CWS decided that, though it had always aimed to trade responsibly (for example though the working conditions in its factories and plantations as well as its boycott of South African produce during the years of <a href="/wiki/Apartheid" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a>, by cementing its 'ethical' credentials in a series of strong and clear policy commitments it could work to convince the public of the 'co-operative difference'. This move posed a bold step for the CWS leadership as this was a wholly new approach for such a large business. The CWS worked with <a href="/wiki/The_Fairtrade_Foundation" title="The Fairtrade Foundation">The Fairtrade Foundation</a> to help introduce the Fairtrade Mark in the UK, it was an early adopter of the <a href="/wiki/RSPCA" class="mw-redirect" title="RSPCA">RSPCA</a>'s 'Freedom Foods' animal welfare certification, it introduced the first supermarket line of 'environmentally friendly' household products and the first range of toiletries certified by <a href="/wiki/Cruelty_Free_International" title="Cruelty Free International">Cruelty Free International</a> as not tested on animals. This new adoption of an ethical strategy was only part of the CWS's changes. After the 1997 strategic review the business suggested that it close the majority of its <a href="/wiki/Hypermarkets" class="mw-redirect" title="Hypermarkets">hypermarkets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Department_stores" class="mw-redirect" title="Department stores">department stores</a> and instead focus on its core chain of <a href="/wiki/Convenience_store" title="Convenience store">convenience stores</a>, another significant proposal.</p>
