Large-scale new migration augmented their numbers during the 1910s, as Mexico was torn by a high-casualty civil war. Until the 1960s, most lived within a few hundred miles of the border, although some resettled along frail lines from the Southwest to the Midwest.</p>
<p>More recently, Mexican Americans have diffused throughout the U.S., especially in the Midwest and Southeast, with the largest numbers in California and Texas. In the past hundred years Mexican-Americans have campaigned for voting rights, stood against educational, employment, and ethnic discrimination and stood for economic and social advancement. At the same time many Mexican-Americans have struggled with defining and maintaining their community's identity.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, some Hispanic student groups flirted with <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> and differences over the proper name for members of the community of <a href="/wiki/Chicano" title="Chicano">Chicano/Chicana</a>, Latino/Latina, Mexican-Americans, Hispanics or simply <a href="/wiki/La_Raza" title="La Raza">La Raza</a> became tied up with deeper disagreements over whether to integrate into or remain separate from <a href="/wiki/Anglo" title="Anglo">Anglo</a> society, as well as divisions between those Mexican-Americans whose families had lived in the United States for two or more generations and more recent immigrants.</p>

<p>When Mexico took over control from Spain in the early 1820s, the new government ignored and isolated the "norteños" (inhabitants of Mexico's northern provinces), except to break up the mission system in <a href="/wiki/History_of_California" title="History of California">California</a>. The systematic <a href="/wiki/Navajo_people" class="mw-redirect" title="Navajo people">Navajo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Apache" title="Apache">Apache</a> raids on <a href="/wiki/History_of_New_Mexico" title="History of New Mexico">New Mexico</a> villages and ranches were ignored, as was the vulnerability of California, as the central government pulled back its soldiers to use them in recurrent civil wars and factional battles. When <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Texas" title="Republic of Texas">Texas</a> seemed too independent, Mexico's President <a href="/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna" title="Antonio López de Santa Anna">Santa Anna</a> led an army to massacre the villagers and destroy the American settlements. After initial victories and massacres at The Alamo and Goliad, Santa Anna was decisively defeated by the Texans, who declared independence. The Tejanos in Texas joined the revolution and supported the new Republic of Texas; The Hispanics in New Mexico and California were localistic and did not identify with the regime in Mexico City. The "norteños" played a minor role in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" title="Mexican–American War">Mexican–American War</a> of 1846–48, and when offered the choice of repatriating to Mexico or remaining and becoming full citizens of the United States, the great majority remained. Only when large numbers of Americans arrived did they develop a sense of "lo mexicano," that is of "being Mexican," and that new identification had little to do with far-off Mexico.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> American entrepreneurs often cultivated alliances and partnerships with the Mexican propertied elites in the states of Texas and California, and the territories of New Mexico and Arizona. The Californios—who only numbered 10,000 in 1848, remained in California but were soon overwhelmed by the immigration of hundreds of thousands of newcomers to California, and largely became invisible to Anglos. The Latino culture of the rest of the Southwest, especially New Mexico and southern Texas, called itself "Spanish" (rather than "Mexican") to distinguish themselves from "los norteamericanos". The Latinos emphasized their own religion, language, customs and kinship ties, and drew into enclaves, rural colonies and urban barrios, which norteamericanos seldom entered; intermarriage rates were low.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1820s, immigrants from the U.S. and Europe settled in Texas (Tejas), then part of Mexico. Anglo and Hispanic Texas joined to fight Mexico in 1836, defeating an invading army and declaring the independence of Texas. The Texas Republic included Tejanos as leading citizens, but Mexico refused to recognize its legal existence. The US annexed Texas in 1845, leading to the <a href="/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" title="Mexican–American War">Mexican–American War</a> of 1846–48. While there were some Americans who considered the war with Mexico illegal and immoral, others considered it part of <a href="/wiki/Manifest_Destiny" class="mw-redirect" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>—the American destiny to pursue the war. This policy claimed that it was the United States' right to expand westward across North America and settle the land.</p>
<p>The Americans won easily and the war ended with the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo" title="Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>. In the Treaty Mexico gave up more than 500,000 square miles of territory, which today comprises Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. The United States in 1853 purchased the <a href="/wiki/Gadsden_Purchase" title="Gadsden Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a>, a strip of land in southern New Mexico and Arizona that provided a route for a railroad.</p>
<p>The result was unchallenged American control over a wide range of territory once held by Mexico, including the present day states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California. The vast majority of Hispanic populations chose to stay and become full US citizens. By and large, the Hispanic populations of these areas supported the new government. The Mexican government had become despotic under on-and-off-again President <a href="/wiki/General_Santa_Anna" class="mw-redirect" title="General Santa Anna">General Santa Anna</a>, and the US Government offered protection from Indian raids that Mexico had not prevented, meaning an end to civil wars of the sort that continuously wracked Mexico until 1920, and it promised much greater long-run prosperity.</p>
<p>Although the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would enjoy full enjoyment and protection of their property as if they were citizens of the United States, many former citizens of Mexico lost their claims in lawsuits before state and federal courts. Even those statutes intended to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the United States' borders, such as the 1851 California Land Act, had the effect of dispossessing <a href="/wiki/Californio" title="Californio">Californio</a> owners ruined by the cost of maintaining litigation over land titles for years.</p>
<p>After the Santa Fe Ring succeeded in dispossessing thousands of landholders in New Mexico, groups such as <a href="/wiki/Las_Gorras_Blancas" title="Las Gorras Blancas">Las Gorras Blancas</a> tore down fences or burned down interlopers' farm buildings. In western Texas the political struggle sparked an <a href="/wiki/San_Elizario_Salt_War" title="San Elizario Salt War">armed conflict</a> in which the Tejano majority forced the surrender of the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Rangers</a>, but in the end lost their influence, offices, and economic opportunities.</p>
<p>In other areas, particularly California, the Hispanic residents were simply overwhelmed by the number of Anglo settlers who rushed in, first in Northern California as a result of the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> then decades later by the boom in Southern California. Anglo miners drove Hispanic miners out of their camps, barred non-Anglos from testifying in court and imposed exclusionary standards similar to what was called <a href="/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws" title="Jim Crow laws">Jim Crow</a> in the case of African-Americans.<sup id="cite_ref-encyclopedia.com_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-3">[3]</a></sup> Some Hispanics, of whom <a href="/wiki/Joaquin_Murietta" class="mw-redirect" title="Joaquin Murietta">Joaquín Murieta</a> was a legendary example and <a href="/wiki/Tiburcio_Vasquez" class="mw-redirect" title="Tiburcio Vasquez">Tiburcio Vásquez</a> a real one, responded by resorting to banditry. During the Gold Rush, there was an immigration of Mexican miners to California.</p>
<p>About 20,000 Tejanos lived in South Texas in the 1850s. The social structure has been analyzed by historian Randolph Campbell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>South Texans of Hispanic descent lived in a three-tiered society during the antebellum years. At the top stood the landed elite, the owners of huge ranches, many of which originated as haciendas in the Spanish colonial period. The elite based their economic lives on cattle raising. They sold some cattle in Mexico and Louisiana and exported hides and tallow, but access to major urban markets outside the region was so limited that South Texas ranchers did not develop highly commercial operations during the antebellum years. This apparently suited most very well anyhow in that they viewed their ranches primarily as a way of life rather than a business investment and therefore focused on keeping their property intact as well as turning a profit....</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small landowners occupied the second rung of the South Texas economic and social ladder. These rancheros, as they were called, lived in one-room adobe houses and spent most of their time caring for their small herds of horses and cattle. Although a smaller part of the population, they can be compared, it seems, to the plain folk Anglos of East Texas. That is, they differed from the elite only in the extent of their property, not in their dependence on the land or the way they tried to live.</p>
<p>Finally, South Texas had a lower class composed primarily of peóns, vaqueros, and cartmen. Peóns had a status above that of the slaves in antebellum Texas but below that of genuinely free men. They owned no property, could not travel or call in a doctor without the permission of the estate owner (the patrón), and needed his approval for marriages. When a peón was accused of an offense, the patrón acted as judge and jury. On the other hand, peóns were not property and therefore could not be bought and sold or treated as personal chattels in any way. Somewhere in an ill-defined place between that of slaves and free men, they served as “faithful servants” to the upper class.</p>
<p>Peóns worked at the direction of the patróns—planting and harvesting crops, herding goats, digging wells, and doing any sort of manual labor necessary. In return they received wages or credits at the estate's store in amounts so small that they were constantly in debt. They lived in tiny one-room jacales, huts with walls of mud or any other material available and thatched roofs. The one room served for both living and sleeping; cooking and eating took place in a separate enclosure made of grass or corn stalks.</p>
<p>The poor, landless class also included vaqueros, the men who herded and took care of cattle. Ranch owners and mission priests generally considered it beneath their dignity to do such work and thought of these first Texas cowboys simply as laborers riding horses. No one involved could have imagined that millions of Americans would one day see working cattle as an ultimately romantic and heroic part of Texas's past. At least vaqueros, as befitted their future image, had more independence than peóns. They were not bound to the land and could even expect to acquire property of their own someday.</p>
<p>Cartmen lived in San Antonio or along the route from that city to Indianola and earned their living by transporting food and merchandise from the coast to the interior. Using oxcarts, they virtually monopolized this particular freight route by moving goods quickly and cheaply. Anglo competitors appeared by the 1850s but were unable to match the rates charged by the Tejanos. Carting appears to have been the most lucrative business open to poorer Tejanos during these years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In parts of south Texas and southern Arizona, Hispanic Americans were able to obtain positions within local government while in New Mexico Hispanic Americans remained an absolute majority of the population until the end of the 19th century. The federal government delayed granting statehood to New Mexico because of its Hispanic American political leadership.</i><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite integration, Hispanic Americans managed to retain their <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> and culture. They were most successful in those areas where they had retained some measure of political or economic power, where Jim Crow laws imposed a forced isolation or where immigrants from Mexico made up a significant percentage of the community.</p>

<p>The lynching of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the Southwest has long been overlooked in American history. This may be due to the fact that most historical records categorized Mexicans, Italians, Native Americans, and sometimes Chinese lynching victims as white.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> It is estimated that at least 597 Mexican Americans were lynched between 1848 and 1928. Mexicans were <a href="/wiki/Lynched" class="mw-redirect" title="Lynched">lynched</a> at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period, which suffered an average of 37.1 per 100,000 population.<sup id="cite_ref-encyclopedia.com_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-encyclopedia.com-3">[3]</a></sup> Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population. Most of these lynchings were not instances of "frontier justice"—of the 597 total victims, only 64 were lynched in areas which lacked a formal judicial system.<sup id="cite_ref-findarticles.com_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-findarticles.com-7">[7]</a></sup> The majority of lynching victims were denied access to a trial while others were convicted in unfair trials.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, as many as 25,000 Mexicans arrived in California. Many of these Mexicans were experienced miners and had some success mining gold in California. Some Anglos reacted with violence.

<p>Hispanic Americans made up a significant number of workers in a number of industries, particularly the railroad and mining industries in the southwestern U.S., that led to the growth of communities throughout the region. The employment needs of the railroad industry in the late 19th century brought Mexican immigrants from more remote regions of Mexico, while the new systems integrated the border regions of the United States and Mexico. The railroad also led to the economic development of those parts of the US, drawing Mexican immigrants in large numbers into agriculture in the early 20th century, establishing a pattern that continued thereafter.</p>
<p>These largely male Mexican immigrants also established <i>colonias</i> in the early 20th century in places such as <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City</a> and <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City,_Utah" class="mw-redirect" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a> as railroad employment took them further within the United States.

<p>More recently, beginning in significant numbers in the 1970s, Mexican immigrants have moved in large numbers to the Midwest U.S., attracted by jobs in the packinghouse industry, and to the southeastern U.S., where they have displaced many African-Americans and contract workers from the Caribbean in agriculture and related industries. This large wave of Mexican immigration are attracted to low-paid labor jobs and an equally high number moved to low-income communities, such as industrial suburbs of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" class="mw-redirect" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> in ethnic neighborhoods known as <i>barrios</i> and the agricultural sector of <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Valley_(California)" class="mw-redirect" title="Imperial Valley (California)">Imperial Valley</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>.</p>

<p>In Texas, people of Hispanic ethnicity, most of whom were Mexican nationals, began arriving in greater numbers between 1900 and 1930. Adding to the number of older Hispanic residents already in Texas, some of whom had been here since the Spanish Colonial Era, many of these new immigrants engaged in cotton production by performing the back-breaking work of hoeing cotton fields clean of weeds and harvesting the mature crop during the summer and fall. These resilient people established themselves in communities where earlier Hispanics already existed. From settlements in The Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, communities in the Nueces Strip-between Three Rivers and Corpus Cristi, Texas-and the interior city of San Antonio, Hispanics ventured outward following the maturing cotton crop north and west. They traveled by extended family groups on an odyssey known as "The Big Swing". Along the route some younger family members might land a permanent job and stay behind. From Lubbock to San Angelo, Hispanics now form an integral part of their local communities.</p>

<p>Hispanics living in New Mexico were relegated to second-class social status by the socio economically dominant non Hispanic population. Some of these "Anglos" deprecated Hispanic/Mexican culture. and questioned the native populations fitness for democracy. Some claim, in response, they constructed a "Spanish American" identity in an early instance of cultural citizenship (expressing Americanism through ethnic identity) but this is strongly disputed by Richard Nostrand.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/United_States_home_front_during_World_War_I" title="United States home front during World War I">World War I</a> gave the Hispanics the opportunity to prove their full American citizenship. Like the "new immigrants" in eastern cities who also constructed dual identities, members of the Nuevomexicano middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press. Nuevomexicano politicians and community leaders recruited the rural masses into the war cause overseas and on the home front, including the struggle for woman suffrage. Support from New Mexico's Anglo establishment aided their efforts. Their wartime contributions improved the conditions of minority citizenship for Nuevomexicanos but did not entirely eliminate social inequality. For example, no Hispanics—not even the son of a regent—was allowed in a fraternity at the state university.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Anglos and Hispanics cooperated because both prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered the Anglos. Around 1920, the term "Spanish-American" replaced "Mexican" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, Not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a "Mexican" land suggested violence and disorder, and had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that "Spanish Americans" belonged to a true American political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p>After 1911 the ferocious civil wars in Mexico led 600,000 to 1 million refugees to flee north across the border, which was generally open. Well educated middle-class families emigrated, as well as poor citizens.</p>
<p>In Texas a band of radicals issued the manifesto "<a href="/wiki/Plan_de_San_Diego" class="mw-redirect" title="Plan de San Diego">Plan de San Diego</a>" in 1915 in South Texas calling on Hispanics to reconquer the Southwest and kill all the Anglo men. Rebels assassinated opponents and killed several dozen people in attacks on railroads and ranches before the Texas Rangers smashed the insurrection. Tejanos strongly repudiated the Plan and affirmed their American loyalty by founding the <a href="/wiki/League_of_United_Latin_American_Citizens" title="League of United Latin American Citizens">League of United Latin American Citizens</a> (LULAC). LULAC, headed by professionals, businessmen and modernizers, became the central Tejano organization promoting civic pride and civil rights.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Over 500,000 returned after 1930, but many stayed. The consulates of the Mexican government in major cities in the Southwest organized a network of "juntas patrioticas" (patriotic councils) and "comisiónes honoríficos" (honorary committees) to celebrate Mexican national holidays such as the <a href="/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo" title="Cinco de Mayo">Cinco de Mayo</a>; the target audience was the Latino middle class.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>In borderlands towns such as Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Laredo, San Antonio, El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, San Diego, and Los Angeles, local Latino leaders wanted to restrict the influx of immigrants, because the newcomers directly competed with resident Latinos for jobs and housing and because they reinforced negative stereotypes regarding a lazy and violent lifestyle. In 1929 the <a href="/wiki/League_of_United_Latin_American_Citizens" title="League of United Latin American Citizens">League of United Latin American Citizens</a> (LULAC) was formed on the premise that full acceptance of American social, educational and political values was the only way Latinos could reasonably expect to improve their political, economic, and social position in American society. Some upwardly mobile families joined Protestant churches, but most remained devout, conservative Roman Catholics. From the early 1930s through the 1960s, LULAC's political agenda focused on citizenship training and naturalization of "foreign-born Mexicans," English-language training, active support of antidiscriminatory litigation and legislation (particularly regarding public schools), and strict control of further immigration from Mexico. LULAC promoted the liberal rhetoric of "equality" and "rights" and the mutual obligations of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Republicanism,_U.S.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Republicanism, U.S. (page does not exist)">republican civic duty</a>.

In 1927, Mexican-American coal miners participated in a bloody <a href="/wiki/Columbine_Mine_massacre" title="Columbine Mine massacre">coal strike in Colorado</a>, walking out under the banner of the IWW.

<p>Tejanos — Texans of Spanish and/or Mexican descent — formed several organizations in the early 20th century to protect themselves from official and private discrimination, but made only partial progress in addressing the worst forms of official ethnic discrimination.

<p>Mexican-Americans, mestizos especially, also faced heightened <a href="/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a> during World War II, most famously during the <a href="/wiki/Zoot_Suit_Riots" title="Zoot Suit Riots">Zoot Suit Riots</a>, when sailors in Los Angeles attacked Mexican-American youths in 1943, and in the Sleepy Lagoon Case, in which a number of young men were wrongly convicted in a case marked by sensationalized press coverage and overt racism from the prosecution and judge. That trial and verdict, overturned on appeal after a broad-based committee was created to support the defendants, is depicted in <a href="/wiki/Luis_Valdez" title="Luis Valdez">Luis Valdez</a>' play and film <i>Zoot Suit</i>. At the same time, the United States was importing thousands of Mexican farm workers under the <a href="/wiki/Bracero" class="mw-redirect" title="Bracero">Bracero</a> program that used them as temporary labor, without employment rights.</p>

Thus, Hispanic Americans comprised 2.3% to 4.7% of the Army. The exact number, however is unknown as at the time Hispanics were classified as whites. Generally Mexican American World War II servicemen were integrated into regular military units.

<p>Mexican American school children were subject to racial segregation in the public school system. They were forced to attend "Mexican schools" in California.

<p>In many counties in the Southwestern United States, Mexican Americans were not selected as jurors in court cases which involved a Mexican American defendant.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> In 1954, Pete Hernandez, an agricultural worker, was indicted of murder by an all-Anglo jury in <a href="/wiki/Jackson_County,_Texas" title="Jackson County, Texas">Jackson County, Texas</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Chicano" title="Chicano">Chicano</a> movement blossomed in the 1960s. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.</p>
<p>The early proponents of the movement — <a href="/wiki/Rodolfo_Gonzales" title="Rodolfo Gonzales">Rodolfo Gonzales</a> in <a href="/wiki/Denver,_Colorado" class="mw-redirect" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reies_Tijerina" title="Reies Tijerina">Reies Tijerina</a> in New Mexico — adopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a form of nationalism that was based on the failure of the United States government to live up to the promises that it had made in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p>That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of illegal immigrants in the United States in the 1960s — not surprising, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire in the years to come. It was only a decade later when activists embraced the rights of illegal immigrants and helped broaden the focus to include their rights.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>Instead, when the movement dealt with practical problems most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disenfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and <a href="/wiki/East_Los_Angeles,_California" title="East Los Angeles, California">East Los Angeles</a> in 1968 and the <a href="/wiki/Chicano_Moratorium" title="Chicano Moratorium">Chicano Moratorium</a> in Los Angeles in 1970.</p>
<p>The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed <a href="/wiki/MEChA" title="MEChA">MEChA</a>, <i>el Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán</i>, which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized nationalist agenda. The student movement produced a generation of future political leaders, including <a href="/wiki/Richard_Alatorre" title="Richard Alatorre">Richard Alatorre</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cruz_Bustamante" title="Cruz Bustamante">Cruz Bustamante</a> in California.</p>
<p>Some women who worked within the Chicano movement felt that participants were more worried about other issues, such as immigration, than solving problems that affected women. This led Chicanas to form the <a href="/wiki/Comisi%C3%B3n_Femenil_Mexicana_Nacional" title="Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional">Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional</a> in 1970.</p>
<p>By the mid 1980s to our present day, a major focus of the Chicano movement has been to advance the representation of Chicanos in all American mainstream media.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Criticism of the American mainstream news media and U.S. educational institutions by Chicano activists has been particularly harsh in recent years subsequent to the massive displays of support for immigrant rights such as that seen during La Gran Marcha<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> (The Great March) on March 25, 2006 in Los Angeles. As of today, this self-proclaimed "largest march in U.S. history" which was primarily organized by Mexican American organizations, Chicano activists, and fueled through a large network of active Internet users, L.A. Spanish language television, and Spanish language news radio coverage, is still virtually ignored by American mainstream (English language) news media and all textbooks of the American educational system.</p>

<p>A common pattern emerged after 1940 of men working summers in the U.S. and spending the winter season in the village back in Mexico.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> While this became illegal in 1965, the numbers involved kept growing. By 2007 there were 12 million or so undocumented workers in the U.S.; they had jobs, often using fake identity cards. They made money in the U.S. but returned to the villages to spend it, attend fiestas, tend to family business, and participate in extended kinship rituals such as baptisms, weddings, and funerals. After the increased border security following the 9-11 attacks in 2001, the back-and-forth pattern became dangerous. People kept coming north, but they stayed in the U.S. and sent money home every month. Locked into the American economy year-round, millions of these undocumented workers moved out of season agricultural jobs into year-round jobs in restaurants, hotels, construction, landscaping and semiskilled factory work, such as meat packing. Most paid federal social security taxes into imaginary accounts (and thus were not eligible for benefits.) Few had high enough incomes to pay federal or state income taxes, but all paid local and state sales taxes on their purchases as well as local property taxes (via their rent payments to landlords).</p>

<p>In 1963, in <a href="/wiki/Crystal_City,_Texas" title="Crystal City, Texas">Crystal City, Texas</a> the mainly Mexican-American <a href="/wiki/Immigrant" class="mw-redirect" title="Immigrant">migrant</a> community together with the support of the <a href="/wiki/Teamsters_Union" class="mw-redirect" title="Teamsters Union">Teamsters Union</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Political_Association_of_Spanish-Speaking_Organizations" title="Political Association of Spanish-Speaking Organizations">Political Association of Spanish-Speaking Organizations</a> (PASSO), an outgrowth of the Viva Kennedy clubs of 1960, encouraged Mexican-American men and women to pay their <a href="/wiki/Poll_tax_(United_States)" class="mw-redirect" title="Poll tax (United States)">poll tax</a> and choose their own candidates. Led by Teamsters business agent and <a href="/wiki/Cannery" class="mw-redirect" title="Cannery">cannery</a> employee, Juan Cornejo, five Mexican-Americans, despite intimidation by the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Rangers</a>, won the support of their community young and old alike who thanks to the protection provided by the Teamsters and PASSO mobilized for electoral victory. This "revolt" was covered nationwide and reported in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" class="mw-redirect" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" class="mw-redirect" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>.

<p>As a result of the <a href="/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act" class="mw-redirect" title="Voting Rights Act">Voting Rights Act</a>, followed up by intensive political organizing, Mexican-Americans were able to achieve a new degree of political power and representation in Texas and elsewhere in the Southwest. The <a href="/wiki/La_Raza_Unida_Party" class="mw-redirect" title="La Raza Unida Party">La Raza Unida Party</a>, headed by <a href="/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_%C3%81ngel_Guti%C3%A9rrez" title="José Ángel Gutiérrez">José Ángel Gutiérrez</a> of Crystal City, Texas made startling progress in the poorest regions in the <a href="/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley" title="Rio Grande Valley">Rio Grande Valley</a> with its base of operations at Crystal City, Texas in the early 1970s, spreading for a while to Colorado, Wisconsin, California, Michigan, Oregon, Kansas, Illinois and several other states. The party faded in the mid 1970s and held on only in Crystal City, Texas before collapsing in the early 1980s. Veterans from the party, such as Willie Velasquez, became active in <a href="/wiki/United_States_Democratic_Party" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic</a> politics and in organizing projects such as the <a href="/wiki/Southwest_Voter_Registration_Education_Project" title="Southwest Voter Registration Education Project">Southwest Voter Registration Education Project</a>, which boosted the electoral fortunes of Mexican-American candidates throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>Results came more slowly in California, on the other hand: although Los Angeles had a significant Mexican-American population, <a href="/wiki/Gerrymandering" title="Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> eliminated the seat held by <a href="/wiki/Edward_R._Roybal" title="Edward R. Roybal">Edward R. Roybal</a>, the only Mexican-American member of the Los Angeles City Council, in 1959. La Raza Unida Party campaigns in the early 1970s had the practical effect of defeating Mexican-American Democratic candidates, embittering many activists against the party and the form of nationalism it represented.</p>
<p>It would be more than twenty years before another Mexican-American was elected to the Los Angeles City Council and it would take litigation to permit a Mexican-American to win election to the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors" title="Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors">Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors</a> in the 1980s, the first Mexican-American to join that body in more than a century. In the 1990s, Mexican-American politicians held high offices throughout California. In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Antonio_Villaraigosa" title="Antonio Villaraigosa">Antonio Villaraigosa</a> was elected mayor of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, the first Latino in 130 years to hold the seat.</p>
<p>Voters have elected a number of governors of Mexican-American descent in the Southwest, including Jerry Apodaca and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Richardson" title="Bill Richardson">Bill Richardson</a> in New Mexico and <a href="/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Castro" title="Raúl Castro">Raúl Castro</a> in Arizona.

<p>Mexican-Americans have also achieved some degree of political recognition in Chicago, where they make up roughly 75% of a Hispanic community that also includes significant numbers of <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Ricans_in_the_United_States" title="Puerto Ricans in the United States">Puerto Ricans</a> and immigrants from other Spanish-speaking countries.

<p>Mexican-Americans tend to vote Democratic (in 1960, the <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F.
