article history of ford motor company henry ford ca 1919 a 1910 model t photographed in salt lake city 20th century henry fords first attempt at a car company under his own name was the henry ford company on november 3 1901 which became the cadillac motor company on august 22 1902 after ford left with the rights to his name the ford motor company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with 28,000 in cash from twelve investors most notably john and horace dodge who would later found their own car company during its early years the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on mack avenue and later its factory on piquette avenue in detroit michigan groups of two or three men worked on each car assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for ford within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept and ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era henry ford was 39 years old when he founded the ford motor company which would go on to become one of the worlds largest and most profitable companies as one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world the ford motor company has been in continuous family control for over 100 years after the first gasoline powered automobile was created in the year 1885 by german inventor carl benz benz patent-motorwagen more efficient production methods were needed to make the automobile affordable for the middle-class which ford contributed to for instance by introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at its factory in highland park between 1903 and 1908 ford produced the models a b c f k n r and s most of which sold in the hundreds or few thousands a year in 1908 ford introduced the mass-produced model t which would sell in the millions in 1927 ford replaced the t with the model a the first car with safety glass in the windshield12 ford launched the first low priced v8 engine powered car in 1932 in an attempt to compete with general motors mid-priced pontiac oldsmobile and buick ford created the mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to ford henry ford purchased the lincoln motor company in 1922 in order to compete with such brands as cadillac and packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market in 1929 ford was contracted by the government of the soviet union to setup the gorky automobile plant in russia initially producing ford model a and aas thereby playing an important role in the industrialisation of that country13 the creation of a scientific laboratory in dearborn michigan in 1951 doing unfettered basic research led to fords unlikely involvement in superconductivity research in 1964 ford research labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or squid14 ford offered the lifeguard safety package from 1956 which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel optional front and for the first time in a car rear seatbelts and an optional padded dash15 ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957 and in the same year offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car in late 1955 ford established the continental division as a separate luxury car division this division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous continental mark ii at the same time the edsel division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year due to limited sales of the continental and the edsel disaster ford merged lincoln mercury and edsel into m-e-l which reverted to lincoln-mercury after edsels november 1959 demise the ford mustang was introduced in 1964 in 1965 ford introduced the seat belt reminder light with the 1980s ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world during the 1980s ford began using the advertising slogan have you driven a ford lately to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern in 1990 and 1994 respectively ford also acquired jaguar cars and aston martin16 during the mid- to late 1990s ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles in a booming american economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices with the dawn of the new century legacy healthcare costs higher fuel prices and a faltering economy led to falling market shares declining sales and diminished profit margins most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through ford motor credit company17 21st century william clay ford jr great-grandson of henry ford serves as the executive chairman at the board of ford motor company by 2005 both ford and gms corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status18 as a result of high us health care costs for an aging workforce soaring gasoline prices eroding market share and an over dependence on declining suv sales profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased incentives in the form of rebates or low interest financing to offset declining demand19 in the latter half of 2005 chairman bill ford asked newly appointed ford americas division president mark fields to develop a plan to return the company to profitability fields previewed the plan named the way forward at the december 7 2005 board meeting of the company and it was unveiled to the public on january 23 2006 the way forward included resizing the company to match market realities dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models consolidating production lines closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs20 ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles including crossover suvs built on unibody car platforms rather than more body-on-frame chassis in developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the ford escape hybrid suv ford licensed similar toyota hybrid technologies21 to avoid patent infringements22 ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company southern california edison sce to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid under the multimillion-dollar multi-year project ford will convert a demonstration fleet of ford escape hybrids into plug-in hybrids and sce will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utilitys electrical grid some of the vehicles will be evaluated in typical customer settings according to ford2324 william clay ford

46,000 hourly workers in north america agreed to a historic contract settlement in november 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues the agreement included the establishment of a company-funded independently run voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the companys books thereby improving its balance sheet this arrangement took effect on january 1 2010 as a sign of its currently strong cash position ford contributed its entire current liability estimated at approximately us55billion as of december 31 2009 to the veba in cash and also pre-paid us500million of its future liabilities to the fund the agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories the automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of 12.7billion,27 and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009.28 however ford surprised wall street in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a 750million profit despite the gains the company finished the year with a 2.7billion loss largely attributed to finance restructuring at volvo29 on june 2 2008 ford sold its jaguar and land rover operations to tata motors for 2.3billion.3031 during congressional hearings held in november 2008 at washington dc and in a show of support fords alan mulally stated that we at ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity but we also must prepare

companys supports both chrysler and general motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis3233 together the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry mulally stated that in addition to our plan we are also here today to request support for the industry in the near-term ford does not require access to a government bridge loan however we request a credit line of 9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company 34 gm and chrysler received government loans and financing through tarp legislation funding provisions35 on december 19 the cost of credit default swaps to insure the debt of ford was 68 percent the sum insured

development facility in the country54 the ford research center in aachen germany at first ford in germany and ford in britain built different models from one another until the late 1960s with the ford escort and then the ford capri being common to both companies later on the ford taunus and ford cortina became identical produced in left hand drive and right hand drive respectively rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the uk switched to elsewhere in europe including belgium and spain as well as germany the ford sierra replaced the taunus and cortina in 1982 drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling which was soon given nicknames the jellymould and the salesmans spaceship in february 2002 ford ended car production in the uk it was the first time in 90 years that ford cars had not been made in britain although production of the transit van continued at the companys southampton facility until mid-2013 engines at bridgend and dagenham and transmissions at halewood development of european ford is broadly split between dunton in essex powertrain fiestaka and commercial vehicles and cologne body chassis electrical focus mondeo in germany

near setbal in portugal set up in collaboration with volkswagen formerly assembled the galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships the vw sharan and seat alhambra with the introduction of the third generation of the galaxy ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the genk plant with volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the setbal facility in 2008 ford acquired a majority stake in automobile craiova romania starting 2009 the ford transit connect was fords first model produced in craiova followed in 2012 by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car the b-max55 its 1959 anglia two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in europe at the time of its launch but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with british buyers in particular it was still selling well when replaced by the more practical escort in 1967 the third incarnation of the ford escort was launched in 1980 and marked the companys move from rear-wheel drive saloons to front-wheel drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector the fourth generation escort was produced from 1990 until 2000 although its successor the focus had been on sale since 1998 on its launch the focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next generation focus at the end of 2004 the 1982 ford sierra replacement for the long-running and massively popular cortina and taunus models was a style-setter at the time of its launch its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy sharp-edged cortina and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold a series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel drive mondeo at the start of 1993 the rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its fiesta hatchback most of its production was concentrated at valencia in spain and the fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start an update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market on october 24 2012 ford announced that it would be closing its genk assembly plant in eastern belgium by the end of 2014.56 oceania ford fg x falcon australia the ford stamping plant in geelong australia in australia and new zealand the popular ford falcon 1960-2016 had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the mondeo fords largest car sold in europe between 1960 and 1972 the falcon was based on a us model of the same name but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in australia until 2016 occasionally being manufactured in new zealand like its general motors rival the holden commodore the falcon used a rear wheel drive layout high performance variants of the falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362hp 270kw a

local manufacturing of the focus small car starting from 2011 nothing came of that plan in australia the laser was one of ford australias most successful models and was manufactured in fords homebush plant from 1981 until the plants closure in september 1994 it outsold the mazda 323 despite being almost identical to it because the laser was manufactured in australia and ford was perceived as a local brand in new zealand the ford laser and telstar were assembled alongside the mazda 323 and 626 until 1997 at the vehicle assemblers of new zealand vanz plant in wiri auckland the sierra wagon was also assembled in new zealand owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market the scheduled closure of fords australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on may 23 2013 headquartered in the victorian suburb of broadmeadows the company had registered losses worth au600 million over the five years prior to the announcement it was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large local car sales in australia are insufficient to keep fords products profitable and viable in australia the decision will affect 1200 ford

smaller confined to malaysia singapore hong kong the philippines and taiwan where ford has had a joint venture with lio ho since the 1970s ford began assembly of cars in thailand in 1960 but withdrew from the country in 1976 and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with mazda called auto alliance60 now based in the bo-win sub district of the sriracha district in chonburi the factory still produces passenger automobiles the factory built in 1941 in singapore was shortly taken over by the japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the british to the japanese at the factory site which is now a national monument in singapore ford decided to shut down their entire operations in indonesia including their dealer network by second half of 2016.61 on april 30 2013 ford motor co launched their car and truck line in myanmar previously heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in myanmar but due to currency reform lifting of previous import restrictions and the abolishment of shadow currency myanmars car market had grown in demand62 ford of korea in 1967 ford partnered with the south korean company hyundai and at the new factory in ulsan south korea built the european ford cortina until 1974 when hyundai introduced their all-new hyundai pony in 1975 ford then developed a relationship with koreas oldest car manufacturer kia which built vehicles co-engineered with mazda later selling the ford festiva from 19881993 and the ford aspire from 19941997 for export to the united states with the acquisition of a stake in japanese manufacturer mazda in 1979 ford began selling mazdas familia and capella as the ford laser and telstar throughout the region replacing the european-sourced escort and cortina ford lost their kia interest to hyundai in 1998 during the asian financial crisis kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997 and in 1998 hyundai motor company acquired 51 of the company outbidding ford which had owned an

february 1925 where model t vehicles were assembled using imported knock-down kits66 the factory subsequently produced 10,000 model as up to 1936 production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between japan and the united states after world war ii ford did not have a presence in japan as the ford facility was appropriated by the japanese government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the ford motor company and became a research and development location for ford partner mazda in 1979 ford acquired a 24.5 ownership stake in mazda and in 1982 ford and mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell ford products in japan including vehicles manufactured in north america at a dealership called autorama japanese the autorama sales channel was

with the state of gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in sanand and planned to invest approximately us1 billion on a 460-acre site72 fords market presence in the middle east has traditionally been small partly due to previous arab boycotts of companies dealing with israel ford and lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region73 saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates are the biggest markets ford also established itself in egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment74 fords distributor in saudi arabia announced in february 2003 that it had sold 100,000 ford and lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in november 1986 half of the fordlincoln vehicles sold in that country were ford crown victorias75 in 2004 ford sold 30,000 units in the region falling far short of general motors 88,852 units and nissan motors 75,000 units south america during much of the 20th century ford faced protectionist government measures in south america with the result that it built different models in different countries without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations in many cases new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with or whose factories it had acquired for example the corcel and del rey in brazil were originally based on renault vehicles in 1987 ford of brazil and ford of argentina merged their operations with the brazilian and argentine operations of volkswagen group forming a new joint-venture company called autolatina with a shared model range sales figures and profitability were disappointing and autolatina was dissolved in 1995 with the advent of mercosur the regional common market ford was finally able to rationalize its product line-ups in those countries consequently the ford fiesta and ford ecosport are only built in brazil and the ford focus only built in argentina with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries models like the ford mondeo from europe could now be imported completely built up ford of brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the fiesta the courier which is also produced in south africa as the ford bantam in right hand drive versions africa in africa fords market presence has traditionally been strongest in south africa and neighbouring countries with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent ford in south africa began by importing kits from canada to be assembled at its port elizabeth facility later ford sourced its models from the uk and australia with local versions of the ford cortina including the xr6 with a 3.0 v6 engine and a cortina-based bakkie or pick-up which was exported to the uk in the mid-1980s ford merged with a rival company owned by anglo american to form the south african motor corporation samcor76 following international condemnation of apartheid ford divested from south africa in 1988 and sold its stake in samcor although it licensed the use of its brand name to the
