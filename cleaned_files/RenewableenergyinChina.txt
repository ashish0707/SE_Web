and policy trends v t e chinas renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity in 2015 china became worlds largest producer of photovoltaic power at 43 gw installed capacity12 china also led the world in the production and use of wind power and smart grid technologies generating almost as much water wind and solar energy as all of france and germanys power plants combined whilst china has the worlds largest installations of solar and wind power its energy needs are so great that in 2013 renewables provided just a little over 20 of its power generation with most of the remainder provided by traditional coal power facilities3 nevertheless the share of renewables in the energy mix had been gradually rising from 2013 and targets from 2015 onwards have represented a step change in ambition the next few years will demonstrate whether these ambitious targets can be delivered as of the end of 2015 the world leading countries in wind power

2 germany 3 japan 4 united states 5 italy and 6 uk in 2013 china had a total capacity of 378 gw of renewable power mainly from hydroelectric and wind power china sees renewables as a source of energy security and not just only to reduce carbon emission5 chinas action plan for the prevention and control of air pollution issued by chinas state council in september 2013 illustrates the governments desire to increase the share of renewables in chinas energy mix6 unlike oil coal and gas the supplies of which are finite and subject to geopolitical tensions renewable energy systems can be built and used wherever there is sufficient water wind and sun7 since 2005 production of solar cells in china has expanded 100-fold as chinese renewable manufacturing has grown the costs of renewable energy

and three-quarters of this natural resource is located at sea11 china aims to have 100 gw of wind power capacity by 2020 china encourages foreign companies especially from the united states to visit and invest in chinese wind power generation12 however use of wind energy in china has not always kept up with the remarkable construction of wind power capacity in the country6 as of 2010 china has become the worlds largest maker of wind turbines surpassing denmark germany spain and the united states13 the initial future target set by the chinese government was 10 gw by 2010,14 but the total installed capacity for wind power generation in china had already reached 25.1 gw by the end of 2009.1516 by 2009 china had total installed windpower capacity up to 26 gw17 china has identified wind power as a key growth component of the countrys economy18 in 2008 china was the fourth largest producer of wind power after the united states germany and spain15 at the end of 2008 wind power in china accounted for 12.2 gw of electricity generating capacity by the end of 2008 at least fifteen chinese companies were commercially producing wind turbines and several dozen more were producing components turbine sizes of 1.5mw and 2mw became common leading wind power companies were goldwind dongfang and sinovel19 china also increased the production of small-scale wind turbines to about 80,000 turbines 80mw in 2008 through all these developments the chinese wind industry appeared unaffected by the global financial crisis according to industry observers19 solar poweredit pv capacity

photovoltaics pv20 it has emerged as the worlds largest manufacturer as of june 2015.2122 following the new incentive scheme of golden sun announced by the government in 2009 there are numerous recent developments and plans announced by industry players that became part of the milestones for solar industry and technology development in china such as the new thin film solar plant developed by anwell technologies in the henan province using its own proprietary solar technology the agreement was signed by ldk for a 500mw solar project in the desert alongside first solar and ordos city the effort to drive the renewable energy use in china was further assured after the speech of the chinese president given at the un climate summit on 22 september 2009 in new york pledging that china would adopt plans to use 15 of its energy from renewable sources within a decade232425 china has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over 15 billion around 820mw of solar pv were produced in china in 2007 second only to japan26 biomass and biofueledit further information bioenergy in china china emerged as the worlds third largest producer of ethanol-based bio-fuels after the us and brazil at the end of the 10th five year plan period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20 of total automotive fuel consumption in china27 in the 11th five year plan period 2006 through 2010 china planned to develop six megatonsyear of fuel ethanol capacity which is expected to grow to 15 megatonsyear by 2020 despite this level of production experts say that there will be no threat to food security though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be farming oil if the price of crude oil continues to increase based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in china the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces in the recently published world economic outlook the international monetary fund expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops28 work has begun on the 250 million kaiyou green energy biomass rice husks power generating project located in the suqian city economic development zone in jiangsu province the kaiyou green energy biomass power project will generate 144 gwhyear and use 200 kilotonsyear of crop waste as inputs29 bioenergy is

geothermal power in china geothermal resources in china are abundant and widely distributed throughout the country there are over 2,700 hot springs occurring at the surface with temperatures exceeding 250c in 1990 the total flow rate of thermal water for direct uses amounted to over 9,500kgs making china the second direct user of geothermal energy in the world recognizing geothermal energy as an alternative and renewable energy resource since the 1970s china has conducted extensive explorations aiming at identifying high temperature resources for electric generation until 2006 181 geothemal systems had been found on mainland china with an estimated generation potential of 1,740mw however only seven plants with a total capacity of 32mw had been constructed and were operating in 2006.32 national laws and policiesedit further information energy policy of china after the dissolution of the energy and industry department in 1993 china has been running without a government agency effectively managing the countrys energy related issues are supervised by multiple organizations such as the national development and reform commission ndrc ministry of commerce state electricity regulatory commission serc and so forth in 2008 the national energy administration was founded under the ndrc however its work has been proven inefficient33 in january 2010 the state council decided to set up a national energy commission nec headed by current chinese premier wen jiabao the commission will be responsible for drafting a national energy development plan reviewing energy security and major energy issues and coordinating domestic energy development and international cooperation34 the chinese government is implementing multiple policies to promote renewable energy from 2008 to january 2012 china held the top spot in clean energy investment35 the renewable energy law passed in 2005 explicitly states in its first chapter that the development and the usage of renewable energy is a prioritized area in energy development36 the twelfth five-year plan the current plan also places great emphasis on green energy37 detailed incentive policies and programs include the golden sun program which provides financial subsidies technology support and market incentives to facilitate the development of the solar power industry38 the suggestions on promoting wind electricity industry in 2006 which offers preferential policies for wind power development39 and many other policies besides promoting policies china has enacted a number of policies to standardize renewable energy products to prevent environmental damage and to regulate the price of green energy these policies include but are not limited to renewable energy law40 the safety regulations of hydropower dams41 and the national standard of solar water heaters42 several provisions in relevant chinese laws and regulations address the development of methane gas in rural china these provisions include article 54 of the agriculture law of the peoples republic of china43 articles 4 and 11 of the energy conservation law of the peoples republic of china44 article 18 of the renewable energy law of the peoples republic of china45 and article 12 of the regulations of the peoples republic of china concerning restoring farmland to forest46 on april 20 2007 the environment and resources committee of the national peoples congress and the national development and reform commission convened a conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of the renewable energy law there were approximately 250

systems the shanghai facility will also serve as boschs principal center for technology personnel and distribution in china51 environmental protection and energy conservationedit according to chinas energy blue paper recently written by the chinese academy of social sciences the average rate of recovery of coal from mining in china is only 30 less than one-half the rate of recovery throughout the world the rate of recovery of coal resources in the us australia germany and canada is 80 the rate of recovery of coal from mining in shanxi province chinas largest source of coal is approximately 40 though the rate of recovery of village and township coal mines in shanxi province is only 10-20 cumulatively over the course of the past 20 years 19802000 china has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal52 the same causes for a low rate of recovery in coal miningthat extraction methods are backwardslead to safety problems in chinas coal mining sector another reason for the low rate of recovery is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by china only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current rate of recovery of 30 if china were able to double its rate of recovery it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal53 on april 13 2007 the department of science technology and education of the chinese ministry of agriculture hosted the asian regional workshop on adaptation to climate change organized by the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc climate change will affect asian countries in different but consistently negative ways temperate regions will experience changes in boreal forest cover while vanishing mountain glaciers will cause problems such as water shortages and increased risks of glacial lake flooding coastal zones are under increasing risk from sea level rises as well as pollution and overexploitation of natural resources in 2006 in china storms floods heat and drought killed more than 2700 people effects ranged from drought in the southwest of china which were the worst since records began to be kept in the late 19th century to floods and typhoons in central and southeastern china the weather events in china in 2006 were seen to be a prelude to weather patterns likely to become more common due to global warming topics discussed by representatives of asian countries and developed countries international organizations and nongovernmental organizations included vulnerability assessments implementing adaptation actions in various sectors of the economy and in specific geographical areas such as coastal and mountainous regions54 based on a recently completed survey in 2007 the standardization administration of china plans to further develop and improve standards for conservation and comprehensive utilization of natural resources in the following areas energy water wood and land conservation development of renewable energy the comprehensive utilization of mineral resources recovery recycling and reuse of scrap materials and clean production55 energy production and consumptionedit further information world energy resources and consumption in 2011 china produced 70 of its energy from coal emitted more carbon dioxide than the next two largest emitters combined the usa and india and emissions had been increasing by 10 a year56 in 2011 china produced 6 of its energy from hydroelectric 1 from nuclear and 1 from other renewable energy sources57 chinese energy experts are estimating that by 2050 the percentage of chinas energy requirements that are satisfied by coal-fired plants will have declined to 30-50 of total energy consumption and that the remaining 50-70 will be provided by a combination of oil natural gas and renewable energy sources including hydropower nuclear power biomass solar energy wind energy and other renewable energy sources58 in 2007 transportations share of crude oil consumption in china is approximately 35 but that by 2020 consumption of crude oil for transportation purposes will have increased to 50 of total crude oil consumption59 according to a study conducted by the energy research institute of the national development and reform commission on the economic circumstances of chinas crude oil and chemical industry as of 2007 in recent years china has wasted an average of 400 megatons of coal equivalents per year in 2006 china consumed a total of 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents up from 1.4 gigatons of coal equivalents consumed nationwide in 2000 with energy consumption increasing at the rate of 10year in the last 5 years total energy consumption has exceeded the combined amount of energy consumption over the previous 20 years according to dai yande the chairman of the energy research institute of the ndrc while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable china must take steps to change the form of its economic growth and increase substantially the energy efficiency of chinese industry and society generally among other things china should find new points of economic development that moves china away from being the worlds factory and improves energy efficiency china also must avoid unnecessary waste foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce chinas reliance on petrochemical energy resources60 since june 2006 when chinese premier wen jiabao visited the shenhua groups coal liquefaction project and expressed that coal-to-liquids production was one important part of chinas energy security there have been many new coal to oil projects announced by many large coal producing provinces and cities as of the end of 2006 there will 88 methyl alcohol projects planned the total capacity of these projects is 48.5 megatonsyear if all of these projects are built by 2010 output of methyl alcohol will reach 60 megatonsyear this development rush to build coal to oil projects is giving rise to concerns about a new round of wasteful development and the unintended consequences of such rapid development these include wasteful extraction of coal excessive use of water this process requires 10 tons of water for every ton of oil produced and likely increases in the price of coal61 china and russia are in talks to link their electric power networks so that china can purchase power from the russian far east to supply northeast china dongbei the benefits for china of importing power from neighboring countries include conserving domestic resources lowering energy consumption lessening chinas dependence on imported oil 80-90 of which must be shipped through unsafe waters and reducing pollution discharge china already has begun to build a 1 mv high-tension demonstration project and an 800 kv direct power transmission project and after 2010 china will have a long distance high tension high capacity transmission line for international transmission of electric power china also is considering connecting its power transmission lines with mongolia and other former soviet states that border china and specialists predict that by the year 2020 more than 4 pwh of power will be transmitted into china from neighboring states in that year china is expected to produce 250 megatons of crude oil and be required to import approximately 350 megatons of crude oil a reliance on exports of 60 if china is able to import 620 twh of power from neighbors it will be able to reduce crude oil imports by 100 megatons by importing electric from four or five neighboring countries china will not only reduce its dependence on imported crude oil but also will enhance energy security by diversifying its foreign energy sources making china less vulnerable to disruptions in supply62 in 2006 a total of 2.8344 pwh of electricity was generated in china from an installed base of 622 gw of power generating capacity in 2006 alone an additional 105 gw of installed capacity came on line in china63 experts estimate that another 100 gw of newly installed electric power generating capacity will again come on-line in 2007 but that 2006 probably was the high-water mark for electric power capacity development in china64 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal sustainable development portal
