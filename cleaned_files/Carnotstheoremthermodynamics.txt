called carnots rule is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs carnots theorem states all heat engines between two heat reservoirs are less efficient than a carnot heat engine operating between the same reservoirs every carnot heat engine between a pair of heat reservoirs is equally efficient regardless of the working substance employed or the operation details the formula for this maximum efficiency is max carnot 1 t c t h displaystyle eta _textmaxeta _textcarnot1-frac t_mathrm c t_mathrm h where tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir th is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir and the efficiency displaystyle eta is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir based on modern thermodynamics carnots theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics historically however it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law1 contents 1 proof 1.1 reversible engines 1.2 irreversible engines 2 definition of thermodynamic temperature 3 applicability to fuel cells and batteries 4 references proofedit an impossible situation a heat engine cannot drive a less efficient reversible heat engine without violating the second law of thermodynamics the proof of the carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature the heat engine with more efficiency m displaystyle eta _m is driving a heat engine with less efficiency l displaystyle eta _l  causing the latter to act as a heat pump this pair of engines receives no outside energy and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir however if m l displaystyle eta _meta _l  then the net heat flow would be backwards ie into the hot reservoir q hot out q m l q q hot in displaystyle q_texthottextoutqfrac eta _meta _lqq_texthottextin  it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the second law of thermodynamics we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure first we must point out an important caveat the engine with less efficiency l displaystyle eta _l is being driven as a heat pump and therefore must be a reversible engine if the less efficient engine l displaystyle eta _l is not reversible then the device could be built but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid by restricting our discussion to cases where engine l displaystyle eta _l has less efficiency than engine m displaystyle eta _m  we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols q displaystyle q and w displaystyle w represent non-negative quantities since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where l m displaystyle eta _lleqslant eta _m  conservation of energy demands that for each engine the energy which enters e i n displaystyle

efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not efficiency w q h displaystyle wq_h  but the coefficient of performance cop2 which is q c w displaystyle q_cw  a reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency w q h displaystyle wq_h delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct carnots theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines3 reversible enginesedit to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs t 1 displaystyle t_1 and t 2 displaystyle t_2 must have the same efficiency assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of displaystyle eta  and let the more efficient engine m drive the less efficient engine l as a heat pump as the figure shows this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy which violates the second law of thermodynamics therefore both reversible heat engines have the same efficiency and we conclude that all reversible engines that operate between the same two heat reservoirs have the same efficiency this is an important result because it helps establish the clausius theorem which implies that the change in entropy is unique for all reversible processes4 s a b d q r e v t displaystyle delta sint _abfrac dq_revt  over all paths from a to b in v-t space if this integral were not path independent then entropy s would lose its status as a state variable5 irreversible enginesedit if one of the engines is irreversible it must be the m engine placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible l engine but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine ie if m l displaystyle eta _meta _l  then the second law of thermodynamics is violated and since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine we have the first part of carnots theorem no irreversible engine is more efficient than the carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs definition of thermodynamic temperatureedit main article definition of thermodynamic temperature the efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or w c y q h q h q c q h 1 q c q h displaystyle eta frac w_cyq_hfrac q_h-q_cq_h1-frac q_cq_h 1 where wcy is the work done per cycle thus the efficiency depends only on qcqh because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t2 must have the same efficiency meaning the efficiency is the function of the temperatures only q c q h f t h  t c displaystyle frac q_cq_hft_ht_c 2 in addition a reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles one between t1 and another intermediate temperature t2 and the second between t2andt3 this can only be the case if f t 1  t 3 q 3 q 1 q 2 q 3 q 1 q 2 f t 1  t 2 f t 2  t 3  displaystyle ft_1t_3frac

displaystyle tt_ht_c  they are clearly not limited by carnots theorem which states that no power can be generated when t h t c displaystyle t_ht_c  this is because carnots theorem applies to engines converting thermal energy to work whereas fuel cells and batteries instead convert chemical energy to work6 nevertheless the second law of thermodynamics still provides restrictions on fuel cell and
