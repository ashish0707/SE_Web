transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol pu and atomic number 94 it is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air and forms a dull coating when oxidized the element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states it reacts with carbon halogens nitrogen silicon and hydrogen when exposed to moist air it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70 in volume which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric it is radioactive and can accumulate in bones which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous plutonium was first produced and isolated on december 14 1940 by dr glenn t seaborg joseph w kennedy edwin m mcmillan and arthur c wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the university of california berkeley they first synthesized neptunium-238 half-life 2.1 days which subsequently beta-decayed to form a new heavier element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 half-life 87.7 years uranium had been named after the planet uranus and neptunium after the planet neptune and so element 94 was named after pluto wartime secrecy prevented them from announcing the discovery until 1948 plutonium is the heaviest element to occur in nature as trace quantities arising similarly from the neutron capture of natural uranium-238 plutonium is much more common on earth since 1945 as a product of neutron capture and beta decay where some of the neutrons released by the fission process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239 both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile meaning that they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it the presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium samples usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade weapons-grade fuel-grade or reactor-grade plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles it is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators which are used to power some spacecraft plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the manhattan project during world war ii that developed the first atomic bombs the fat man bombs used in the trinity nuclear test in july 1945 and in the bombing of nagasaki in august 1945 had plutonium cores human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent and several criticality accidents some lethal occurred after the war

most metals has a bright silvery appearance at first much like nickel but it oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray although yellow and olive green are also reported23 at room temperature plutonium is in its alpha form this the most common structural form of the element allotrope is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile unlike most metals it is not a good conductor of heat or electricity it has a low melting point 640c and an unusually high boiling point 3,228c.2 alpha decay the release of a high-energy helium nucleus is the most common form of radioactive decay for plutonium4 a 5kg mass of 239pu contains about 702512500000000000012.51024 atoms with a half-life of 24,100 years about 701311500000000000011.51012 of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157mev alpha particle this amounts to 9.68 watts of power heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch56 resistivity is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current the resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal and it gets even higher with lower temperatures which is unusual for metals7 this trend continues down to 100k below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples7 resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20k due to radiation damage with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample7 because of self-irradiation a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time8 self-irradiation can also lead to annealing which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100k.9 unlike most materials plutonium increases in density when it melts by 2.5 but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature7 near the melting point the liquid plutonium has also very high viscosity and surface tension as compared to other metals8 allotropes main article allotropes of plutonium plutonium has six allotropes at ambient pressure alpha beta gamma delta deltaprime epsilon10 plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh zeta at high temperature within a limited pressure range10 these allotropes which are different structural modifications or forms of an element have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures this makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature pressure or chemistry and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another8 the densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00gcm3 to 19.86gcm3.11 the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult as it changes state very readily for example the form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium it has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable beta form at slightly higher temperatures12 the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood the form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure hence its brittleness strength compressibility and poor thermal conductivity10 plutonium in the delta form normally exists in the 310c to 452c range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of gallium aluminium or cerium enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded12 the form has more typical metallic character and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium10 in fission weapons the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual phase plutonium to the denser form significantly helping to achieve supercriticality13 the phase the highest temperature solid allotrope exhibits anomalously high atomic self-diffusion compared to other elements8 nuclear fission a ring of weapons-grade 99.96 pure electrorefined plutonium enough for one bomb core the ring weighs 5.3kg is ca 11cm in diameter and its shape helps with criticality safety plutonium is a radioactive actinide metal whose isotope plutonium-239 is one of the three primary fissile isotopes uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two plutonium-241 is also highly fissile to be considered fissile an isotopes atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei14 pure plutonium-239 may have a multiplication factor keff larger than one which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry eg a sphere of sufficient size it can form a critical mass15 during fission a fraction of the binding energy which holds a nucleus together is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21,000 tons of tnt 88,000gj it is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in nuclear weapons and reactors5 the presence of the isotope plutonium-240 in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential as plutonium-240 has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate 440 fissions per second per gramover 1,000 neutrons per second per gram16 raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation17 plutonium is identified as either weapons-grade fuel-grade or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7 plutonium-240 fuel-grade plutonium contains from 7 to less than 19 and power reactor-grade contains 19 or more plutonium-240 supergrade plutonium with less than 4 of plutonium-240 is used in us navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews due to its lower radioactivity18 the isotope plutonium-238 is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay5 isotopes and synthesis uranium-plutonium and thorium-uranium chains main article isotopes of plutonium twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized the longest-lived are plutonium-244 with a half-life of 80.8million years plutonium-242 with a half-life of 373,300years and plutonium-239 with a half-life of 24,110years all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000years this element also has eight metastable states though all have half-lives less than one second4 the isotopes of plutonium range in mass number from 228 to 247 the primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope plutonium-244 are spontaneous fission and alpha emission mostly forming uranium 92 protons and neptunium 93 protons isotopes as decay products neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes the primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission mostly forming americium 95 protons isotopes as decay products plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series decaying to americium-241 via beta or electron emission419 plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes5 plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium u and neutrons n via beta decay with neptunium np as an intermediate20 238 92 u 1 0 n 239 92 u 23.5 min 239 93 np 2.3565

form uranium-239 a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form np-239 half-life 2.36days and another beta decay forms plutonium-23921 egon bretscher working on the british tube alloys project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.22 plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterons d the nuclei of heavy hydrogen in the following reaction23 238 92 u 2 1 d 238 93

neutrons and neptunium-238 which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium-23824 decay heat and fission properties plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay which produces decay heat different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass the decay heat is usually listed as wattkilogram or milliwattgram in larger pieces of plutonium eg a weapon pit and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant all isotopes produce weak gamma on decay decay heat of plutonium isotopes25 isotope decay mode half-life years decay heat wkg

but gains a tarnish when oxidized26 the element displays four common ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution and one rare one11 puiii as pu3 blue lavender puiv as pu4 yellow brown puv as puo 2 light pinknote 1 puvi as puo2 2 pink orange puvii as puo3 5 greenthe heptavalent ion is rare the color shown by plutonium solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion28 it is the acid anion that influences the degree of complexinghow atoms connect to a central atomof the plutonium species metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium calcium or lithium at 1200c.29 it is attacked by acids oxygen and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric hydroiodic and perchloric acids30 molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air12 at 135c the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride31 plutonium pyrophoricity can cause it to look like a glowing ember under certain conditions twenty micrograms of pure plutonium hydroxide plutonium is a reactive metal in moist air or moist argon the metal oxidizes rapidly producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides2 if the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor a powdery surface coating of puo2 is formed2 also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only puo230 plutonium shows enormous and reversible reaction rates with pure hydrogen forming plutonium hydride8 it also reacts readily with oxygen forming puo and puo2 as well as intermediate oxides plutonium oxide fills 40 more volume than plutonium metal the metal reacts with the halogens giving rise to compounds with the general formula pux3 where x can be f cl br or i and puf4 is also seen the following oxyhalides are observed puocl puobr and puoi it will react with carbon to form puc nitrogen to form pun and silicon to form pusi21131 powders of plutonium its hydrides and certain oxides like pu2o3 are pyrophoric meaning they can ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and are therefore handled in an inert dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon bulk plutonium ignites only when heated above 400c pu2o3 spontaneously heats up and transforms into puo2 which is stable in dry air but reacts with water vapor when heated32 crucibles used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly reducing properties refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides borides carbides nitrides and silicides can tolerate this melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible12 cerium is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment extraction and other technologies33 electronic structure plutonium is an element in which the 5f electrons are the transition border between delocalized and localized it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements34 the anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure the energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low the size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior the proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels this leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn16d17s2 configurations which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior the highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium8 alloys plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals exceptions include lithium sodium potassium rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals and magnesium calcium strontium and barium of the alkaline earth metals and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals30 partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium molybdenum niobium tantalum and tungsten which are soluble in liquid plutonium but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium30 gallium aluminium americium scandium and cerium can stabilize the phase of plutonium for room temperature silicon indium zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable state when rapidly cooled high amounts of hafnium holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the phase at room temperature neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the phase at higher temperatures8 plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium if the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides the phase plutoniumgallium and plutoniumaluminium alloys are produced by adding plutoniumiii fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal35 plutoniumgallium is used for stabilizing the phase of plutonium avoiding the -phase and related issues its main use is in pits of implosion nuclear weapons36 plutoniumaluminium is an alternative to the puga alloy it was the original element considered for phase stabilization but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits plutoniumaluminium alloy can be also used as a component of nuclear fuel37 plutoniumgalliumcobalt alloy pucoga5 is an unconventional superconductor showing superconductivity below 18.5k an order of magnitude higher than the highest between heavy fermion systems and has large critical current3438 plutoniumzirconium alloy can be used as nuclear fuel39 plutoniumcerium and plutoniumceriumcobalt alloys are used as nuclear fuels40 plutoniumuranium with about 1530mol plutonium can be used as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors its pyrophoric nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components addition of aluminium carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well addition of titanium andor zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy41 plutoniumuraniumtitanium and plutoniumuraniumzirconium were investigated for use as nuclear fuels the addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance reduces flammability and improves ductility fabricability strength and thermal expansion plutoniumuraniummolybdenum has the best corrosion resistance forming a protective film of oxides but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons41 thoriumuraniumplutonium was investigated as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors41 occurrence trace amounts of plutonium-238 and plutonium-239 can be found in nature small traces of plutonium-239 a few parts per trillion and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium42 such as the natural nuclear fission reactor in oklo gabon43 the ratio of plutonium-239 to uranium at the cigar lake mine uranium deposit ranges from 69882400000000000002.41012 to 6989440000000000000441012.44 due to its relatively long half-life of about 80million years it was suggested that plutonium-244 occurs naturally as a primordial nuclide but early reports of its detection could not be confirmed45 these trace amounts of 239pu originate in the following fashion on rare occasions 238u undergoes spontaneous fission and in the process the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy when one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another 238u atom it is absorbed by the atom which becomes 239u with a relatively short half-life 239u decays to 239np which decays into 239pu.4647 finally exceedingly small amounts of plutonium-238 attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium-238 have been found in natural uranium samples48 minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out and to a small number of major nuclear accidents most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the limited test ban treaty in 1963 which was signed and ratified by the united states the united kingdom the soviet union and other nations continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by china atomic bomb test above the gobi desert in 1964 hydrogen bomb test in 1967 and follow-on tests and france tests as recently as the 1990s because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far31 history discovery enrico fermi and a team of scientists at the university of rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934.49 fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his nobel lecture in 1938.50 the sample was actually a mixture of barium krypton and other elements but this was not known at the time51 nuclear fission was discovered in germany in 1939 by fritz strassmann and otto hahn the mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by lise meitner and otto frisch52 glenn t seaborg and his team at berkeley were the first to produce plutonium plutonium specifically plutonium-238 was first produced and isolated on december 14 1940 and chemically identified on february 23 1941 by glenn t seaborg edwin mcmillan joseph w kennedy and arthur wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60-inch 150cm cyclotron at the berkeley radiation laboratory at the university of california berkeley5354 in the 1940 experiment neptunium-238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half-life of a little over two days which indicated the formation of element 94.31 a paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal physical review in march 1941,31 but publication was delayed until a year after the end of world war ii due to security concerns55 at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge egon bretscher and norman feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product they calculated that element 94 would be fissile and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium and could easily be separated from it22 mcmillan had recently named the first transuranic element neptunium after the planet neptune and suggested that element 94 being the next element in the series be named for what was then considered the next planet pluto5note 2 nicholas kemmer of the cambridge team independently proposed the same name based on the same reasoning as the berkeley team22 seaborg originally considered the name plutium but later thought that it did not sound as good as plutonium57 he chose the letters pu as a joke which passed without notice into the periodic tablenote 3 alternative names considered by seaborg and others were ultimium or extremium because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table59 early research the dwarf planet pluto which plutonium is named after the basic chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study31 early research was continued at the secret metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago on august 20 1942 a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time about 50micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1microgram was isolated4260 this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new elements atomic weight61note 4 on december 2 1942 on a racket court under the west grandstand at the university of chicagos stagg field researchers headed by enrico fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as cp-1 using theoretical information garnered from the operation of cp-1 dupont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor known as x-10 and a pilot chemical separation facility at oak ridge the separation facility using methods developed by glenn t seaborg and a team of researchers at the met lab removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the x-10 reactor information from cp-1 was also useful to met lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for hanford construction at the site began in mid-194362 in november 1943 some plutonium trifluoride was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal a few micrograms of metallic beads42 enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye63 the nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart fissions by releasing more neutrons and energy these neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction this can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass31 during the early stages of research animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health these studies began in 1944 at the university of california at berkeleys radiation laboratory and were conducted by joseph g hamilton hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode oral ingestion inhalation absorption through skin retention rates and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium oral intravenous etc eventually the lab at chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice rabbits fish and even dogs the results of the studies at berkeley and chicago showed that plutoniums physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium the most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the actively metabolizing portion of bone furthermore the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings64 production during the manhattan project during world war ii the us government established the manhattan project which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb the three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the hanford site the uranium enrichment facilities at oak ridge tennessee and the weapons research and design laboratory now known as los alamos national laboratory65 the hanford b reactor face under constructionthe first plutonium-production reactor the hanford site represents two-thirds of the nations high-level radioactive waste by volume nuclear reactors line the riverbank at the hanford site along the columbia river in january 1960 the first production reactor that made plutonium-239 was the x-10 graphite reactor it went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in oak ridge that later became the oak ridge national laboratory31note 5 in january 1944 workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building t plant located in 200-west both the t plant and its sister facility in 200-west the u plant were completed by october u plant was used only for training during the manhattan project the separation building in 200-east b plant was completed in february 1945 the second facility planned for 200-east was canceled nicknamed queen marys by the workers who built them the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long 65 feet wide and 80 feet high containing forty process pools the interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery even with massive concrete lids on the process pools precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design62 on april 5 1944 emilio segr at los alamos received the first sample of reactor-produced plutonium from oak ridge67 within ten days he discovered that reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium-240 than cyclotron-produced plutonium plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample68 the original gun-type plutonium weapon code-named thin man had to be abandoned as a resultthe increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre-detonation fizzle was likely69 the entire plutonium weapon design effort at los alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device code-named fat man with an implosion weapon plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lensesa technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes enriched uranium by contrast can be used with either method69 construction of the hanford b reactor the first industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production was completed in march 1945 b reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during world war iinote 6 b d and f were the initial reactors built at hanford and six additional plutonium-producing reactors were built later at the site72 by the end of january 1945 the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building where remaining impurities were removed successfully los alamos received its first plutonium from hanford on february 2 while it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the wars end hanford was by early 1945 in operation only two years had passed since col franklin matthias first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the columbia river62 according to kate brown the plutonium production plants at hanford and mayak in russia over a period of four decades both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment twice the amount expelled in the chernobyl disaster in each instance73 most of this radioactive contamination over the years were part of normal operations but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret as the pollution continued unabated73 in 2004 a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the hanford nuclear site inside the safe were various items including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist isotope analysis by pacific northwest national laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the x-10 graphite reactor at oak ridge during 1944.747576 trinity and fat man atomic bombs because of the presence of plutonium-240 in reactor-bred plutonium the implosion design was developed for the fat man and trinity weapons the first atomic bomb test codenamed trinity and detonated on july 16 1945 near alamogordo new mexico used plutonium as its fissile material42 the implosion design of the gadget as the trinity device was code-named used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the urchin an initiator made of polonium and beryllium neutron source  n reaction31 together these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion the overall weapon weighed over 4 tonnes although it used just 6.2kg of plutonium in its core77 about 20 of the plutonium used in the trinity weapon underwent fission resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of tnt78note 7 an identical design was used in the fat man atomic bomb dropped on nagasaki japan on august 9 1945 killing 35,00040,000 people most of whom were industrial workers and destroying 6880 of war production at nagasaki80 only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence and name of plutonium made known to the public by the manhattan projects smyth report81 cold war use and waste see also reactor-grade plutonium large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both the soviet union and the united states during the cold war the us reactors at hanford and the savannah river site in south carolina produced 103tonnes,82 and an estimated 170tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the ussr83note 8 each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry11 as much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons31 sipri estimated the world plutonium stockpile in 2007 as about 500 tonnes divided equally between weapon and civilian stocks85 radioactive contamination at the rocky flats plant primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992 prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east into populated areas northwest of denver the contamination of the denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s according to a 1972 study coauthored by edward martell in the more densely populated areas of denver the pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout and the plutonium contamination just east of the rocky flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests86 as noted by carl johnson in ambio exposures of a large population in the denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953.87 weapons production at the rocky flats plant was halted after a combined fbi and epa raid in 1989 and years of protests the plant has since been shut down with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site88 in the us some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh twotonnes31 the glass is made of borosilicates mixed with cadmium and gadoliniumnote 9 these logs are planned to be encased in stainless steel and stored as much as 4km 2mi underground in bore holes that will be back-filled with concrete31 the us planned to store plutonium in this way at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository which is about 100 miles 160km north-east of las vegas nevada89 on march 5 2009 energy secretary steven chu told a senate hearing the yucca mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste90 starting in 1999 military-generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico in a presidential memorandum dated january 29 2010 president obama established the blue ribbon commission on americas nuclear future91 in their final report the commission put forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue including92 recommendation 1 the united states should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste92 medical experimentation see also human radiation experiments and albert stevens during and after the end of world war ii scientists working on the manhattan project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects93 animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose94 in the case of human subjects this involved injecting solutions containing typically five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition93 this was reduced to one microgram in july 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium94 most of the subjects eileen welsome says were poor powerless and sick95 from 1945 to 1947 eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without informed consent the tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium93 ebb cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of plutonium on 10 april 1945 at oak ridge tennessee9697 this experiment was under the supervision of harold hodge98 other experiments directed by the united states atomic energy commission and the manhattan project continued into the 1970s the plutonium files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the hippocratic oath99 the government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993 when president bill clinton ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records the resulting investigation was undertaken by the presidents advisory committee on human radiation experiments and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans the committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that wrongs were committed but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them95 applications explosives the atomic bomb dropped on nagasaki japan in 1945 had a plutonium core the isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons due to its ease of fission and availability encasing the bombs plutonium pit in a tamper an optional layer of dense material decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core this reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16kg to 10kg which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters 4in.100 this critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-2355 the fat man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of tnt78101 hypothetically as little as 4kg of plutoniumand maybe even lesscould be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs101 mixed oxide fuel main article nuclear reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from normal light water reactors contains plutonium but it is a mixture of plutonium-242 240 239 and 238 the mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons but can be used once as mox fuel102 accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed thermal neutrons so that after the second cycle the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors if fast neutron reactors are not available the normal case excess plutonium is usually discarded and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste the desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors103 the most common chemical process purex plutoniumuranium extraction reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide mox fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix mox fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel after four years three-quarters of the plutonium is burned turned into other elements31 breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume104 mox fuel has been in use since the 1980s and is widely used in europe102 in september 2000 the united states and the russian federation signed a plutonium management and disposition agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium105 the us department of energy plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the united states before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mox fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors105 mox fuel improves total burnup a fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products which by then account for 3 of the total weight of the rods31 any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into productionnote 10 the presence of up to 1 gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor106 plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242 separation of the isotopes is not feasible a dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons while weapons-grade plutonium is defined to contain at least 92 plutonium-239 of the total plutonium the united states have managed to detonate an under-20kt device using plutonium believed to contain only about 85 plutonium-239 so called fuel-grade plutonium107 the reactor-grade plutonium produced by a regular lwr burnup cycle typically contains less than 60 pu-239 with up to 30 parasitic pu-240pu-242 and 1015 fissile pu-241107 it is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area the iaea conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as direct-use material that is nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment107 power and heat source a glowing cylinder of 238puo2 the 238puo2 radioisotope thermoelectric generator of the curiosity rover the isotope plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74years.108 it emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma raysparticles and spontaneous neutron raysparticles109 being an alpha emitter it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding a sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238 one kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat5109 these characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime it is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units such as those in the cassini110 voyager galileo and new horizons111 space probes and the curiosity mars rover112 the twin voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977 each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source over 30 years later each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft113 an earlier version of the same technology powered five apollo lunar surface experiment packages starting with apollo 12 in 1969.31 plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers to reduce the risk of repeated surgery114115 it has been largely replaced by lithium-based primary cells but as of 2003update there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium-powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients116 plutonium-238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba diving117 plutonium-238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes31 precautions see also plutonium in the environment toxicity there are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium the radioactivity and the heavy metal poison effects isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned118 studies of the effects of these smaller releases as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki have provided considerable information regarding the dangers symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning which in the case of the japanese hibakushasurvivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure119 during the decay of plutonium three types of radiation are releasedalpha beta and gamma alpha beta and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness genetic damage cancer and death the danger increases with the amount of exposure31 alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer dead layer of human skin beta radiation can penetrate human skin but cannot go all the way through the body gamma radiation can go all the way through the body120 even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs31 the skeleton where plutonium accumulates and the liver where it collects and becomes concentrated are at risk30 plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested only 0.04 of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion31 plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly with a biological half-life of 200 years121 plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly122123 plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested the risk of lung cancer increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 msv124 the us department of energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles each about 3m wide to be 1 over the background us average125 ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death however no human being is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies107 the hot particle theory in which a particle of plutonium dust irradiates a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream researchsuch particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form122 when inhaled plutonium can pass into the bloodstream once in the bloodstream plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones liver or other body organs plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer126 a commonly cited quote by ralph nader states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people127 however calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation this makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas128 naders views were challenged in 1976 by bernard cohen as described in the book nuclear power both sides the best arguments for and against the most controversial technology cohens own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer129 several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust eg people living down-wind of nevada test sites nagasaki survivors nuclear facility workers and terminally ill patients injected with pu in 194546 to study pu metabolism have been carefully followed and analyzed these studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results such as albert stevens who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium122 there were about 25 workers from los alamos national laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s according to the hot-particle theory each of them has a 99.5 chance of being dead from lung cancer by now but there has not been a single lung cancer among them128130 plutonium has a metallic taste131 criticality potential a sphere of simulated plutonium surrounded by neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide blocks in a re-enactment of harry daghlians 1945 experiment care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass particularly because plutoniums critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-2355 a critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays132 plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water11 criticality accidents have occurred in the past some of them with lethal consequences careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6.2kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at los alamos on august 21 1945 when scientist harry daghlian received a dose estimated to be 5.1sievert 510rems and died 25days later133134 nine months later another los alamos scientist louis slotin died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core the so-called demon core that had previously claimed the life of daghlian135 in december 1958 during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named cecil kelley other nuclear accidents have occurred in the soviet union japan the united states and many other countries136 flammability metallic plutonium is a fire hazard especially if the material is finely divided in a moist environment plutonium forms hydrides on its surface which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature plutonium expands up to 70 in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container32 the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard magnesium oxide sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire it cools the burning material acting as a heat sink and also blocks off oxygen special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required32note 11 transportation around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by japan alone with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in britain and france this is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs138 land and sea the usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package a typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide a sea shipment may consist of several containers each of them holding a sealed package139 the united states nuclear regulatory commission dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74tbq 20curie of radioactive activity140 in a recent example the pacific egret141 and pacific heron of pacific nuclear transport ltd are taking 331kg 730lbs of plutonium to a united states government facility in savannah river south carolina142143 air the us government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight packaging requirements and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft144 in 2012 media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of norway on commercial passenger airlinesaround every other yearincluding one time in 2011.145 regulations permit an airplane to transport 15 grams of fissionable material145 such plutonium transportation is without problems according to a senior advisor seniorrdgiver at statens strlevern145 notes footnotes the puo 2 ion is unstable in solution and will disproportionate into pu4 and puo2 2 the pu4 will then oxidize the remaining puo 2 to puo2 2 being reduced in turn to pu3 thus aqueous solutions of puo 2 tend over time towards a mixture of pu3 and puo2 2 uo 2 is unstable for the same reason27 this was not the first time somebody suggested that an element be named plutonium a decade after barium was discovered a cambridge university professor suggested it be renamed to plutonium because the element was not as suggested by the greek root barys it was named for heavy he reasoned that since it was produced by the relatively new technique of electrolysis its name should refer to fire thus he suggested it be named for the roman god of the underworld pluto56 as one article puts it referring to information seaborg gave in a talk the obvious choice for the symbol would have been pl but facetiously seaborg suggested pu like the words a child would exclaim pee-yoo when smelling something bad seaborg thought that he would receive a great deal of flak over that suggestion but the naming committee accepted the symbol without a word58 room 405 of the george herbert jones laboratory where the first isolation of plutonium took place was named a national historic landmark in may 1967 during the manhattan project plutonium was also often referred to as simply 49 the number 4 was for the last digit in 94 atomic number of plutonium and 9 was for the last digit in plutonium-239 the weapons-grade fissile isotope used in nuclear bombs66 the american society of mechanical engineers asme established b reactor as a national historic mechanical engineering landmark in september 1976.70 in august 2008 b reactor was designated a us national historic landmark71 the efficiency calculation is based on the fact that 1kg of plutonium-239 or uranium-235 fissioning results in an energy release of approximately 17 kt leading to a rounded estimate of 1.2kg plutonium actually fissioned to produce the 20 kt yield79 much of this plutonium was used to make the fissionable cores of a type of thermonuclear weapon employing the tellerulam design these so-called hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear weapon that use a fission bomb to trigger the nuclear fusion of heavy hydrogen isotopes their destructive yield is commonly in the millions of tons of tnt equivalent compared with the thousands of tons of tnt equivalent of fission-only devices84 gadolinium zirconium oxide gd 2zr 2o 7 has
