government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace researchnote 1 president dwight d eisenhower established nasa in 19587 with a distinctly civilian rather than military orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science the national aeronautics and space act was passed on july 29 1958 disestablishing nasas predecessor the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca the new agency became operational on october 1 1958.89 since that time most us space exploration efforts have been led by nasa including the apollo moon-landing missions the skylab space station and later the space shuttle currently nasa is supporting the international space station and is overseeing the development of the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle the space launch system and commercial crew vehicles the agency is also responsible for the launch services program lsp which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned nasa

kennedy right nasa administrator james e webb background discussing the mariner program with a model presented from 1946 the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic bell x-114 in the early 1950s there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the international geophysical year 195758 an effort for this was the american project vanguard after the soviet launch of the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 on october 4 1957 the attention of the united states turned toward its own fledgling space efforts the us congress alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership known as the sputnik crisis urged immediate and swift action president dwight d eisenhower and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures this led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on naca was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space the advanced research projects agency arpa was created in february 1958 to develop space technology for military application15 on july 29 1958 eisenhower signed the national aeronautics and space act establishing nasa when it began operations on october 1 1958 nasa absorbed the 43-year-old naca intact its 8,000 employees an annual budget of us100million three major research laboratories langley aeronautical laboratory ames aeronautical laboratory and lewis flight propulsion laboratory and two small test facilities16 a nasa seal was approved by president eisenhower in 1959.17 elements of the army ballistic missile agency and the united states naval research laboratory were incorporated into nasa a significant contributor to nasas entry into the space race with the soviet union was the technology from the german rocket program led by wernher von braun who was now working for the army ballistic missile agency abma which in turn incorporated the technology of american scientist robert goddards earlier works18 earlier research efforts within the us air force16 and many of arpas early space programs were also transferred to nasa19 in december 1958 nasa gained control of the jet propulsion laboratory a contractor facility operated by the california institute of technology16 space flight programs at launch control for the may 28 1964 saturn i sa-6 launch wernher von braun is at center main article list of nasa missions nasa has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history unmanned programs launched the first american artificial satellites into earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system starting with venus and mars and including grand tours of the outer planets manned programs sent the first americans into low earth orbit leo won the space race with the soviet union by landing twelve men on the moon from 1969 to 1972 in the apollo program developed a semi-reusable leo space shuttle and developed leo space station capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-soviet russia some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects such as the galileo probe which was deployed by astronauts in earth orbit before being sent unmanned to jupiter manned programs the experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by naca were extended by nasa as support for manned spaceflight this was followed by a one-man space capsule program and in turn by a two-man capsule program reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the soviet union in 1961 president john f kennedy proposed the ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s and returning him safely to the earth this goal was met in 1969 by the apollo program and nasa planned even more ambitious activities leading to a manned mission to mars however reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans nasa turned its attention to an apollo-derived temporary space laboratory and a semi-reusable earth orbital shuttle in the 1990s funding was approved for nasa to develop a permanent earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international community which now included the former rival post-soviet russia to date nasa has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets and thirteen x-15 rocket flights above the usaf definition of spaceflight altitude 260,000 feet 80km.20 x-15 rocket plane 195968 main article north american x-15 the x-15 was an naca experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research aircraft developed in conjunction with the us air force and navy the design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems21 requests for proposal were issued on december 30 1954 for the airframe and february 4 1955 for the rocket engine the airframe contract was awarded to north american aviation in november 1955 and the xlr30 engine contract was awarded to reaction motors in 1956 and three planes were built the x-15 was drop-launched from the wing of one of two nasa boeing b-52 stratofortresses nb52a tail number 52-003 and nb52b tail number 52-008 known as the balls 8 release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet 14km and a speed of about 500 miles per hour 805kmh twelve pilots were selected for the program from the air force navy and naca later nasa a total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968 resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached by a manned powered aircraft current as of 2014update and a maximum speed of mach 6.72 4,519 miles per hour 7,273kmh.22 the altitude record for x-15 was 354,200 feet 107.96km.23 eight of the pilots were awarded air force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet 80km and two flights by joseph a walker exceeded 100 kilometers 330,000ft qualifying as spaceflight according to the international aeronautical federation the x-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the later manned spaceflight programs including reaction control system jets for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft space suits and horizon definition for navigation23 the reentry and landing data collected were valuable to nasa for designing the space shuttle21 project mercury 195963 main article project mercury john glenn on friendship 7 first us orbital flight 1962 shortly after the space race began an early objective was to get a person into earth orbit as soon as possible therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored the us air forces man in space soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs ranging from rocket planes like the x-15 to small ballistic space capsules24 by 1958 the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of the ballistic capsule25 when nasa was created that same year the air force program was transferred to it and renamed project mercury the first seven astronauts were selected among candidates from the navy air force and marine test pilot programs on may 5 1961 astronaut alan shepard became the first american in space aboard freedom7 launched by a redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic suborbital flight26 john glenn became the first american to be launched into orbit by an atlas launch vehicle on february 20 1962 aboard friendship727 glenn completed three orbits after which three more orbital flights were made culminating in l gordon coopers 22-orbit flight faith 7 may 1516 1963.28 the soviet union ussr competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft vostok they sent the first man in space by launching cosmonaut yuri gagarin into a single earth orbit aboard vostok 1 in april 1961 one month before shepards flight29 in august 1962 they achieved an almost four-day record flight with andriyan nikolayev aboard vostok 3 and also conducted a concurrent vostok 4 mission carrying pavel popovich project gemini 196166 main article project gemini ed white on gemini 4 first us spacewalk 1965 based on studies to grow the mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights developing space rendezvous techniques and precision earth landing project gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the soviets lead and to support the apollo manned lunar landing program adding extravehicular activity eva and rendezvous and docking to its objectives the first manned gemini flight gemini 3 was flown by gus grissom and john young on march 23 1965.30 nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966 demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days rendezvous docking and practical eva and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans3132 under the direction of soviet premier nikita khrushchev the ussr competed with gemini by converting their vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man voskhod they succeeded in launching two manned flights before geminis first flight achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first eva in 1964 after this the program was canceled and gemini caught up while spacecraft designer sergei korolev developed the soyuz spacecraft their answer to apollo project apollo 196172 main article apollo program apollo 11 buzz aldrin on the moon 1969 the us publics perception of the soviet lead in the space race by putting the first man in space motivated president john f kennedy to ask the congress on may 25 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s which effectively launched the apollo program33 apollo was one of the most expensive american scientific programs ever it cost more than 20 billion in 1960s dollars34 or an estimated 206billion in present-day us dollars35 in comparison the manhattan project cost roughly 26.3billion accounting for inflation3536 it used the saturn rockets as launch vehicles which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects37 the spacecraft was also bigger it had two main parts the combined command and service module csm and the lunar landing module lm the lm was to be left on the moon and only the command module cm containing the three astronauts would eventually return to earth the second manned mission apollo 8 brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the moon in december 1968.38 shortly before the soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the moon39 on the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the moon landing were practiced4041 and then finally the moon landing was made on the apollo 11 mission in july 1969.42 apollo 17 lunar vehicle 1972 the first person to stand on the moon was neil armstrong who was followed by buzz aldrin while michael collins orbited above five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last in december 1972 throughout these six apollo spaceflights twelve men walked on the moon these missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms 842lb of lunar samples topics covered by experiments performed included soil mechanics meteoroids seismology heat flow lunar ranging magnetic fields and solar wind43 the moon landing marked the end of the space race and as a gesture armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on the moon44 apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight it stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low earth orbit and landing humans on another celestial body45 apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low earth orbit to date the program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world notably at the smithsonians air and space museums skylab 196579 main article skylab skylab space station 1974 skylab was the united states first and only independently built space station46 conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent saturn ib upper stage the 169,950lb 77,088kg station was constructed on earth and launched on may 14 1973 atop the first two stages of a saturn v into a 235-nautical-mile 435km orbit inclined at 50 to the equator damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel it was repaired to functionality by its first crew it was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.46 it included a laboratory for studying the effects of microgravity and a solar observatory46 nasa planned to have a space shuttle dock with it and elevate skylab to a higher safe altitude but the shuttle was not ready for flight before skylabs re-entry on july 11 1979.47 to save cost nasa used one of the saturn v rockets originally earmarked for a canceled apollo mission to launch the skylab apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the station three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28 59 and 84 days skylabs habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet 320m3 which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the apollo command module47 apollo-soyuz test project 197275 main article apollo-soyuz test project crews with spacecraft model 1975 on may 24 1972 us president richard m nixon and soviet premier alexei kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other48 this authorized the apollo-soyuz test project astp involving the rendezvous and docking in earth orbit of a surplus apollo commandservice module with a soyuz spacecraft the mission took place in july 1975 this was the last us manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the space shuttle in april 1981.49 the mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments and provided useful engineering experience for future joint usrussian space flights such as the shuttlemir program50 and the international space station space shuttle program 19722011 main article space shuttle program launch of the space shuttle the space shuttle became the major focus of nasa in the late 1970s and the 1980s planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985 the first to launch columbia did so on april 12 1981,51 the 20th anniversary of the first known human space flight52 its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side the external tank which was bigger than the spacecraft itself was the only major component that was not reused the shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185643km 115400 miles53 and carry a maximum payload to low orbit of 24,400kg 54,000lb.54 missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts53 on 20 missions 198398 the space shuttle carried spacelab designed in cooperation with the european space agency esa spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight but remained in the shuttles cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock55 another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the hubble space telescope in 1990 and 1993 respectively56 in 1995 russian-american interaction resumed with the shuttle-mir missions 19951998 once more an american vehicle docked with a russian craft this time a full-fledged space station this cooperation has continued with russia and the united states as two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built the international space station iss the strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when nasa began relying on russian launch vehicles to service the iss during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 space shuttle columbia disaster the shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters challenger in 1986 and columbia in 2003.57 while the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the space shuttle endeavour from replacement parts nasa did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss57 nasas space shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the space shuttle atlantis at the kennedy space center on july 21 2011 the program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space58 international space station 1993present main article international space station the international space station the international space station iss combines nasas space station freedom project with the sovietrussian mir-2 station the european columbus station and the japanese kib laboratory module59 nasa originally planned in the 1980s to develop freedom alone but us budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993 managed by nasa the russian federal space agency rka the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa the european space agency esa and the canadian space agency csa6061 the station consists of pressurized modules external trusses solar arrays and other components which have been launched by russian proton and soyuz rockets and the us space shuttles59 it is currently being assembled in low earth orbit the on-orbit assembly began in 1998 the completion of the us orbital segment occurred in 2011 and the completion of the russian orbital segment is expected by 2016.6263needs update the ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements64 which divide the station into two areas and allow russia to retain full ownership of the russian orbital segment with the exception of zarya6566 with the us orbital segment allocated between the other international partners64 the sts-131 light blue and expedition 23 dark blue crew members in april 2010 long duration missions to the iss are referred to as iss expeditions expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the iss67 the initial expedition crew size was three temporarily decreased to two following the columbia disaster since may 2009 expedition crew size has been six crew members68 crew size is expected to be increased to seven the number the iss was designed for once the commercial crew program becomes operational69 the iss has been continuously occupied for the past 700850515489300000016years and 2 days having exceeded the previous record held by mir and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different nations7071 the station can be seen from the earth with the naked eye and as of 2016 is the largest artificial satellite in earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station72 the soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the iss they are the russian progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000 the european automated transfer vehicle atv since 2008 the japanese h-ii transfer vehicle htv since 2009 the american dragon spacecraft since 2012 and the american cygnus spacecraft since 2013 the space shuttle before its retirement was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay until another us manned spacecraft is ready crew members will travel to and from the international space station exclusively aboard the soyuz73 the highest number of people occupying the iss has been thirteen this occurred three times during the late shuttle iss assembly missions74 the iss program is expected to continue until at least 2020 and may be extended beyond 2028.75 commercial resupply services 2006present main article commercial resupply services the dragon is seen being berthed to the iss in may 2012 the standard variant of cygnus is seen berthed to the iss in september 2013 the development of the commercial resupply services crs vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the iss76 the development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didnt receive until after they had successful completed the milestone77 private companies were also required to have some skin in the game which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal78 on december 23 2008 nasa awarded commercial resupply services contracts to spacex and orbital sciences corporation79 spacex uses its falcon 9 rocket and dragon spacecraft80 orbital sciences uses its antares rocket and cygnus spacecraft the first dragon resupply mission occurred in may 2012.81 the first cygnus resupply mission occurred in september 2013.82 the crs program now provides for all americas iss cargo needs with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the european atv and the japanese htv83 commercial crew program 2010present main article commercial crew development the commercial crew development ccdev program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating american commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the iss staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to earth84 it is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-nasa customers to private space stations such those planned by bigelow aerospace85 like cots ccdev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment77 in 2010 nasa announced the winners of the first phase of the program a total of 50million was divided among five american companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector in 2011 the winners of the second phase of the program were announced 270million was divided among four companies86 in 2012 the winners of the third phase of the program were announced nasa provided 1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems87 in 2014 the winners of the final round were announced88 spacexs dragon v2 planned to be launched on a falcon 9 v11 received a contract valued up to 2.6 billion and boeings cst-100 to be launched on an atlas v received a contract valued up to 4.2 billion89 nasa expects these vehicles to begin transporting humans to the iss in 2017.89 dragon v2 computer rendering of cst-100 in orbit beyond low earth orbit program 2010present artists rendering of the 70 mt variant of sls launching orion for missions beyond low earth orbit bleo nasa has been directed to develop the space launch system sls a saturn-v class rocket and the two to six person beyond low earth orbit spacecraft orion in february 2010 president barack obamas administration proposed eliminating public funds for the constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the iss to private companies90 during a speech at the kennedy space center on april 15 2010 obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle hlv to replace the formerly planned ares v91 in his speech obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025 and a manned mission to mars orbit by the mid-2030s91 the nasa authorization act of 2010 was passed by congress and signed into law on october 11 2010.92 the act officially canceled the constellation program92 orion spacecraft design as of january 2013 the authorization act required a newly designed hlv be chosen within 90 days of its passing the launch vehicle was given the name space launch system the new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft93 the orion spacecraft which was being developed as part of the constellation program was chosen to fulfill this role94 the space launch system is planned to launch both orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low earth orbit95 the sls is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions the initial capability of sls is required to be able to lift 70 mt into leo it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt9496 exploration flight test 1 eft-1 an unmanned test flight of orions crew module was launched on december 5 2014 atop a delta iv heavy rocket96 exploration mission-1 em-1 is the unmanned initial launch of sls that would also send orion on a circumlunar trajectory which is planned for 2017.96 the first manned flight of orion and sls exploration mission 2 em-2 is to launch between 2019 and 2021 it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into lunar orbit96 as of march 2012 the destination for em-3 and the intermediate focus for this new program is still in-flux97 on june 5 2016 nasa and darpa announced plans to build a series of new x-planes over the next 10 years98 one of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic vehicle that burns low-carbon biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms98 nasa plans to build full scale deep space habitats as part of its next space technologies for exploration partnerships nextstep program99 unmanned programs pioneer 3 and 4 launched in 1958 and 1959 respectively main article unmanned nasa missions more than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the earth and the solar system100 besides exploration communication satellites have also been launched by nasa101 the missions have been launched directly from earth or from orbiting space shuttles which could either deploy the satellite itself or with a rocket stage to take it farther the first us unmanned satellite was explorer 1 which started as an abmajpl project during the early part of the space race it was launched in january 1958 two months after sputnik at the creation of nasa the explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day its missions have been focusing on the earth and the sun measuring magnetic fields and the solar wind among other aspects102 a more recent earth mission not related to the explorer program was the hubble space telescope which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.103 the inner solar system has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs the first was mariner in the 1960s and 70s which made multiple visits to venus and mars and one to mercury probes launched under the mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby mariner 2 to take the first pictures from another planet mariner 4 the first planetary orbiter mariner 9 and the first to make a gravity assist maneuver mariner 10 this is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination104 the first successful landing on mars was made by viking 1 in 1976 twenty years later a rover was landed on mars by mars pathfinder105 outside mars jupiter was first visited by pioneer 10 in 1973 more than 20 years later galileo sent a probe into the planets atmosphere and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet106 pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit saturn in 1979 with voyager 2 making the first and so far only visits to uranus and neptune in 1986 and 1989 respectively the first spacecraft to leave the solar system was pioneer 10 in 1983 for a time it was the most distant spacecraft but it has since been surpassed by both voyager 1 and voyager 2.107 pioneers 10 and 11 and both voyager probes carry messages from the earth to extraterrestrial life108109 communication can be difficult with deep space travel for instance it took about 3 hours for a radio signal to reach the new horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to pluto110 contact with pioneer 10 was lost in 2003 both voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the solar system and interstellar space111 on november 26 2011 nasas mars science laboratory mission was successfully launched for mars curiosity successfully landed on mars on august 6 2012 and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on mars112113114 recent and planned activities nasas ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of mars mars 2020 and insight and saturn and studies of the earth and the sun other active spacecraft missions are juno for jupiter cassini for saturn new horizons for jupiter pluto and beyond and dawn for the asteroid belt nasa continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt including pioneer and voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-pluto region and gas giant orbiters galileo 19892003 cassini 1997 and juno 2011 the new horizons mission to pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully performed a flyby of pluto on july 14 2015 the probe received a gravity assist from jupiter in february 2007 examining some of jupiters inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby on the horizon of nasas plans is the maven spacecraft as part of the mars scout program to study the atmosphere of mars115 vision mission for an interstellar precursor spacecraft by nasa on december 4 2006 nasa announced it was planning a permanent moon base116 the goal was to start building the moon base by 2020 and by 2024 have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and in-situ resource utilization however in 2009 the augustine committee found the program to be on a unsustainable trajectory117 in 2010 president barack obama halted existing plans including the moon base and directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and mars as well as extending support for the international space station118 since 2011 nasas strategic goals have been119 extend and sustain human activities across the solar system expand scientific understanding of the earth and the universe create innovative new space technologies advance aeronautics research enable program and institutional capabilities to conduct nasas aeronautics and space activities share nasa with the public educators and students to provide opportunities to participate in august 2011 nasa accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the national reconnaissance office despite being stored unused the instruments are superior to the hubble space telescope120 in september 2011 nasa announced the start of the space launch system program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle the space launch system is intended to launch the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle and other elements towards the moon near-earth asteroids and one day mars121 the orion mpcv conducted an unmanned test launch on a delta iv heavy rocket in december 2014.122 the james webb space telescope is currently scheduled to launch in late 2018.citation needed curiositys wheel on mars 2012 on august 6 2012 nasa landed the rover curiosity on mars on august 27 2012 curiosity transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface of mars back to earth made by administrator charlie bolden hello this is charlie bolden nasa administrator speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the curiosity rover which is now on the surface of mars since the beginning of time humankinds curiosity has led us to constantly seek new lifenew possibilities just beyond the horizon i want to congratulate the men and women of our nasa family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world for taking us a step beyond to mars this is an extraordinary achievement landing a rover on mars is not easy others have tried only america has fully succeeded the investment we are makingthe knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of gale crater will tell us much about the possibility of life on mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet curiosity will bring benefits to earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future thank you123 scientific research radioisotope within a graphite shell that goes into the generator main article nasa research for technologies funded or otherwise supported by nasa see nasa spin-off technologies nasas aeronautics research mission directorate conducts aeronautics research nasa has made use of technologies such as the multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator mmrtg which is a type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions124 staff and leadership main article list of nasa administrators the agencys leader nasas administrator reports to the president of the united states and serves as the presidents senior space science adviser though the agency is independent the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the president125 the agencys administration is located at nasa headquarters in washington dc and provides overall guidance and direction126 except under exceptional circumstances nasa civil service employees are required to be citizens of the united states127 the first administrator was dr t keith glennan appointed by president dwight d eisenhower during his term he brought together the disparate projects in american space development research128 the third administrator was james e webb served 19611968 appointed by president john f kennedy in order to implement the apollo program to achieve kennedys moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion establishing the houston manned spacecraft johnson center and the florida launch operations kennedy center in 2009 president barack obama nominated charles bolden as nasas twelfth administrator129 administrator bolden is one of three nasa administrators who were astronauts along with richard h truly served 19891992 and frederick d gregory acting 2005 facilities jet propulsion laboratory complex in pasadena california vehicle assembly and launch control at kennedy space center main article nasa facilities nasas facilities are research construction and communication centers to help its missions some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons nasa also operates a short-line railroad at the kennedy space center and own special aircraft for instance two boeing 747 that transport space shuttle orbiter john f kennedy space center ksc is one of the best-known nasa facilities it has been the launch site for every united states human space flight since 1968 although such flights are currently on pause ksc continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for americas civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining cape canaveral air force station lyndon b johnson space center jsc in houston is home to the christopher c kraft jr mission control center where all flight control is managed for manned space missions jsc is the lead nasa center for activities regarding the international space station and also houses the nasa astronaut corps that selects trains and provides astronauts as crew members for us and international space missions another major facility is marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama at which the saturn 5 rocket and skylab were developed130 the jpl worked together with abma one of the agencies behind explorer 1 the first american space mission fcr 1 in 2009 during the sts-128 mission jsc in houston the ten nasa field centers are john f kennedy space center florida ames research center moffett field california armstrong flight research center formerly hugh l dryden flight research

space network stations in barstow california madrid spain and canberra australia budget nasas budget from 1958 to 2012 as a percentage of federal budget an artists conception from nasa of an astronaut planting a us flag on mars a manned mission to mars has been discussed as a possible nasa mission since the 1960s main article budget of nasa nasas budget has generally been approximately 1 of the federal budget from the early 1970s on after briefly peaking at approximately 4.41 in 1966 during the apollo program125131 public perception of nasas budget has differed significantly from reality a 1997 poll indicated that most americans responded that 20 of the federal budget went to nasa132 the percentage of federal budget that nasa has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at 0.48 of the federal budget133 in a march 2012 meeting of the united states senate science committee neil degrasse tyson testified that right now nasas annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar for twice thata penny on a dollarwe can transform the country from a sullen dispirited nation weary of economic struggle to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow134135 for fiscal year 2015 nasa received an appropriation of us1801 billion from congress549 million more than requested and approximately 350 million more than the 2014 nasa budget passed by congress136 environmental impact the exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems both in earths atmosphere and in space can adversely effect the earths environment some hypergolic rocket propellants such as hydrazine are highly toxic prior to combustion but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning rockets using hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust137 however carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources on average the united states consumed 802,620,000 us gallons 3.0382109l gallons of liquid fuels per day in 2014 while a single falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around 25,000 us gallons 95,000l of kerosene fuel per launch138139 even if a falcon 9 were launched every single day it would only represent 0.006 of liquid fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for that day additionally the exhaust from lox- and lh2- fueled engines like the ssme is almost entirely water vapor140 nasa addressed environmental concerns with its canceled constellation program in accordance with the national environmental policy act in 2011.141 in contrast ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion142143 on may 8 2003 environmental protection agency recognized nasa as the first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one of its facilitiesthe goddard space flight center greenbelt maryland144 an example of nasas environmental efforts is the nasa sustainability base additionally the exploration sciences
