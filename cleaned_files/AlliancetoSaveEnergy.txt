affordable housing goals support of energy independence and security act of 2007edit in 2007 alliance to save energy came out in support of the energy independence and security act of 2007,456 which phases out the use of inefficient forms of incandescent light bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient lights such as cfl halogen incandescents and led lights the purchase price of more efficient lights is typically higher than the purchase price of legacy incandescents however the low energy consumption and long life span of high-efficiency lights result in lower life-cycle costs than their legacy incandescent counterparts several of the founding member corporations including philips panasonic and sylvania are manufacturers of high-efficiency bulbs however all of these corporations are also manufacturers of the incandescent light bulbs that will be phased out of production following passage of the clean energy bill of 2007 carboncountedit carboncount is a metric developed by the alliance to save energy that quantifies the impact of investments in us-based energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects given the expected reduction in carbon dioxide co2 emissions resulting from each 1,000 of investment7 in 2015 bloomberg new energy finance honored carboncount with its finance for resilience fire award8 fire is an open and action-oriented platform that collects develops and helps implement powerful ideas to accelerate finance for clean energy climate sustainability and green growth fire singles out ideas that have the potential for incremental finance of at least 1bn in clean energy in the first three years of implementation that are achievable within 1-3 years9 hannon armstrongs 2015 issuance of sustainable yield bonds secured by a portion of its utility scale solar and wind real estate related assets was the first investment to be certified under the carboncount methodology receiving a carboncount score of 0.39 metric tons of co2 offset per 1000 of
