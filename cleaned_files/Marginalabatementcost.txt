negatives such as pollution marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit the marginal abatement cost mac in general measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution although marginal abatement costs can be negative such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option macs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced marginal abatement costs are typically used on a marginal abatement cost curve or mac curve which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution contents 1 usage 2 criticism 3 examples of existing mac curves 4 see also 5 references usageedit carbon traders use mac curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals power companies may employ mac curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options economists have used mac curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading1 policy-makers use mac curves as merit order curves to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions however mac curves should not be used as abatement supply curves or merit order curves to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target indeed the options they list would take decades to implement and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures2 criticismedit the way that mac curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty inter-temporal dynamics interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits3 examples of existing mac curvesedit various economists research organizations and consultancies have produced mac curves bloomberg new energy finance4 and mckinsey company5 have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the united states icf international6 produced a california specific curve following ab-32 legislation as have sweeney and weyant7 the wuppertal institute for climate environment and energy produced several marginal abatement cost curves for germany also called cost potential curves depending on the perspective end-user utilities society8 the us environmental protection agency has done work on a mac curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane n2o and hfcs9 enerdata and lepii-cnrs france produce mac curves with the poles model for the 6 kyoto protocol gases10 these curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies 11 or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool12 the world
