studied computer science together at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign8 according to a story that has often been repeated in the media hurley and chen developed the idea for youtube during the early months of 2005 after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at chens apartment in san francisco karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but chen commented that the idea that youtube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible9 karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jacksons role in the 2004 super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami karim could not easily find video clips of either event online which led to the idea of a video sharing site10 hurley and chen said that the original idea for youtube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website hot or not1112 the youtube logo from launch until 2011 featuring its former slogan broadcast yourself youtube began as a venture

google youtube in june 2007 youtube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute254 the system which became known as content id255 creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found256 when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file256 content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube257 an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible258 the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use259 if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision260 youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the sites rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length261 controversial content see also criticism of google youtube and censorship by google youtube youtube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos the uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging

violates the sites terms of service233 in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtubes system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating we have strict rules on whats allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 247 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly264 july 2008 in october 2010 us congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki265 youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the sites guidelines266 in december 2010 youtube added promotes terrorism to the list of reasons that users can give when flagging a video as

users of these violations and allow them to appeal these restrictions cover content that is not deemed advertiser-friendly including strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creators intent is to inform or entertain although the policy is not new the issue was brought into prominence by the notification system as well as a video discussing the matter by prominent user philip defranco in which he considered the practice to be censorship on september 1 2016 the hashtag youtubeisoverparty was prominently used on twitter as a means of discussing the controversy a youtube spokesperson stated that while our policy of demonetizing videos due to advertiser-friendly concerns hasnt changed weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators268269270 user comments see also criticism of google youtube user comments most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred271 the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as juvenile aggressive misspelled sexist homophobic swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a lol youtube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance with the occasional burst of wit shining through272 in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts273 the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult274 on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone275 the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse276277 in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change278 the official youtube announcement279 received 20,097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days280 writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but its essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who dont want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say281 perhaps user complaints are justified but the idea of revamping the old system isnt so bad think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isnt any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube282 on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments283 view counts in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that

billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube284285 on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a videos view count to freeze at 301 later 301
