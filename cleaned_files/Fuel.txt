learn how and when to remove this template message wood was one of the first fuels to be used by humans and is still the primary energy source in much of the worldcitation needed a fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work the concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy via nuclear fission or nuclear fusion the heat energy released by reactions of fuels is converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine other times the heat itself is valued for warmth cooking or industrial processes as well as the illumination that comes with combustion fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy hydrocarbons and related oxygen-containing molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans but other substances including radioactive metals are also utilized fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy such as those that directly release electrical energy such as batteries and capacitors or mechanical energy such as flywheels springs compressed air or water in a reservoir contents 1

historyedit the first known use of fuel was the combustion of wood or sticks by homo erectus near 2,000,000 two million years ago1pageneeded throughout most of human history fuels derived from plants or animal fat were only used by humans  charcoal a wood derivative has been used since at least 6,000 bce for melting metals it was only supplanted by coke derived from coal as european forests started to become depleted around the 18th century charcoal briquettes are now commonly used as a fuel for barbecue cooking2 coal was first used as a fuel around 1000 bce in china with the energy in the form of chemical energy that could be released through combustion3 but the concept development of the steam engine in the united kingdom in 1769 coal came into more common use as a power source coal was later used to drive ships and locomotives by the 19th century gas extracted from coal was being used for street lighting in london in the 20th and 21st centuries the primary use of coal is to generate electricity providing 40 of the worlds electrical power supply in 2005.4 fossil fuels were rapidly adopted during the industrial revolution because they were more concentrated and flexible than traditional energy sources such as water power they have become a pivotal part of our contemporary society with most countries in the world burning fossil fuels in order to produce power currently the trend has been towards renewable fuels such as biofuels like alcohols chemicaledit chemical fuels are substances that release energy by reacting with substances around them most notably by the process of combustion most of the chemical energy released in combustion was not stored in the chemical bonds of the fuel but in the weak double bond of molecular oxygen5 chemical fuels are divided in two ways first by their physical properties as a solid liquid or gas secondly on the basis of their occurrence primary natural fuel and secondary artificial fuel thus a general classification of chemical fuels is general types of chemical fuels primary natural secondary artificial solid fuels wood coal peat dung etc coke charcoal liquid fuels petroleum diesel gasoline kerosene lpg coal tar naptha ethanol gaseous fuels natural gas hydrogen propane methane coal gas water gas blast furnace gas coke oven gas cng solid fueledit main article solid fuel coal is an important solid fuel solid fuel refers to various types of solid material that are used as fuel to produce energy and provide heating usually released through combustion solid fuels include wood see wood fuel charcoal peat coal hexamine fuel tablets and pellets made from wood see wood pellets corn wheat rye and other grains solid-fuel rocket technology also uses solid fuel see solid propellants solid fuels have been used by humanity for many years to create fire coal was the fuel source which enabled the industrial revolution from firing furnaces to running steam engines wood was also extensively used to run steam locomotives both peat and coal are still used in electricity generation today the use of some solid fuels eg coal is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions the use of other solid fuels such as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves in some areas smokeless coal is often the only solid fuel used in ireland peat briquettes are used as smokeless fuel they are also used to start a coal fire liquid fuelsedit main article liquid fuel a gasoline station liquid fuels are combustible or energy-generating molecules that can be harnessed to create mechanical energy usually producing kinetic energy they also must take the shape of their container it is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid most liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the earths crust however there are several types such as hydrogen fuel for automotive uses ethanol jet fuel and biodiesel which are all categorized as a liquid fuel emulsified fuels of oil-in-water such as orimulsion have been developed a way to make heavy oil fractions usable as liquid fuels many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy some common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport and can be handled with relative ease also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications and home use fuels like kerosene are rationed in some countries for example available in government subsidized shops in india for home use conventional diesel is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum kerosene is used in kerosene lamps and as a fuel for cooking heating and small engines natural gas composed chiefly of methane can only exist as a liquid at very low temperatures regardless of pressure which limits its direct use as a liquid fuel in most applications lp gas is a mixture of propane and butane both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions it offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas cng but is denser than air does not burn as cleanly and is much more easily compressed commonly used for cooking and space heating lp gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally gaseous fuelsedit main article fuel gas a 20-pound 9.1 kg propane cylinder fuel gas is any one of a number of fuels that under ordinary conditions are gaseous many fuel gases are composed of hydrocarbons such as methane or propane hydrogen carbon monoxide or mixtures thereof such gases are sources of potential heat energy or light energy that can be readily transmitted and distributed through pipes from the point of origin directly to the place of consumption fuel gas is contrasted with liquid fuels and from solid fuels though some fuel gases are liquefied for storage or transport while their gaseous nature can be advantageous avoiding the difficulty of transporting solid fuel and the dangers of spillage inherent in liquid fuels it can also be dangerous it is possible for a fuel gas to be undetected and collect in certain areas leading to the risk of a gas explosion for this reason odorizers are added to most fuel gases so that they may be detected by a distinct smell the most common type of fuel gas in current use is natural gas biofuelsedit main article biofuel biofuel can be broadly defined as solid liquid or gas fuel consisting of or derived from biomass biomass can also be used directly for heating or powerknown as biomass fuel biofuel can be produced from any carbon source that can be replenished rapidly eg plants many different plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacture perhaps the earliest fuel employed by humans is wood evidence shows controlled fire was used up to 1.5 million years ago at swartkrans south africa it is unknown which hominid species first used fire as both australopithecus and an early species of homo were present at the sites6 as a fuel wood has remained in use up until the present day although it has been superseded for many purposes by other sources wood has an energy density of 1020 mjkg7 recently biofuels have been developed for use in automotive transport for example bioethanol and biodiesel but there is widespread public debate about how carbon efficient these fuels are fossil fuelsedit main article fossil fuel extraction of petroleum fossil fuels are hydrocarbons primarily coal and petroleum liquid petroleum or natural gas formed from the fossilized remains of ancient plants and animals8 by exposure to high heat and pressure in the absence of oxygen in the earths crust over hundreds of millions of years9 commonly the term fossil fuel also includes hydrocarbon-containing natural resources that are not derived entirely from biological sources such as tar sands these latter sources are properly known as mineral fuels fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include coal petroleum and natural gas10 they range from volatile materials with low carbonhydrogen ratios like methane to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon like anthracite coal methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields alone associated with oil or in the form of methane clathrates fossil fuels formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants8 by exposure to heat and pressure in the earths crust over millions of years11 this biogenic theory was first introduced by german scholar georg agricola in 1556 and later by mikhail lomonosov in the 18th century it was estimated by the energy information administration that in 2007 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0 coal 27.4 natural gas 23.0 amounting to an 86.4 share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world12 non-fossil sources in 2006 included hydroelectric 6.3 nuclear 8.5 and others geothermal solar tidal wind wood waste amounting to 0.9.13 world energy consumption was growing about 2.3 per year fossil fuels are non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made so we must conserve these fuels and use them judiciously the production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns a global movement toward the generation of renewable energy is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs the burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes 21.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide co2 per year but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 4412 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide14 carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming causing the average surface temperature of the earth to rise in response which the vast majority of climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects fuels are a source of energy nuclearedit main article nuclear fuel candu fuel bundles two candu canada deuterium uranium fuel bundles each about 50cm long and 10cm in diameter nuclear fuel is any material that is consumed to derive nuclear energy technically speaking all matter can be a nuclear fuel because any element under the right conditions will release nuclear energydubious discuss but the materials commonly referred to as nuclear fuels are those that will produce energy without being placed under extreme duress nuclear fuel is a material that can be burned by nuclear fission or fusion to derive nuclear energy nuclear fuel can refer to the fuel itself or to physical objects for example bundles composed of fuel rods composed of the fuel material mixed with structural neutron moderating or neutron reflecting materials most nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile elements that are capable of nuclear fission when these fuels are struck by neutrons they are in turn capable of emitting neutrons when they break apart this makes possible a self-sustaining chain reaction that releases energy with a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or with a very rapid uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon the most common fissile nuclear fuels are uranium-235 235u and plutonium-239 239pu the actions of mining refining purifying using and ultimately disposing of nuclear fuel together make up the nuclear fuel cycle not all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission plutonium-238 and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by radioactive decay in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and other types of atomic batteries also light nuclides such as tritium 3h can be used as fuel for nuclear fusion nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of all practical fuel sources fissionedit nuclear fuel pellets are used to release nuclear energy the most common type of nuclear fuel used by humans is heavy fissile elements that can be made to undergo nuclear fission chain reactions in a nuclear fission reactor nuclear fuel can refer to the material or to physical objects for example fuel bundles composed of fuel rods composed of the fuel material perhaps mixed with structural neutron moderating or neutron reflecting materials the most common fissile nuclear fuels are 235u and 239pu and the actions of mining refining purifying using and ultimately disposing of these elements together make up the nuclear fuel cycle which is important for its relevance to nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons fusionedit fuels that produce energy by the process of nuclear fusion are currently not utilized by humans but are the main source of fuel for stars fusion fuels tend to be light elements such as hydrogen which will combine easily energy is required to start fusion by raising temperature so high all materials would turn into plasma and allow nuclei to collide and stick together with each other before repelling due to electric charge this process is called fusion and it can give out energy in stars that undergo nuclear fusion fuel consists of atomic nuclei that can release energy by the absorption of a proton or neutron in most stars the fuel is provided by hydrogen which can combine to form helium through the proton-proton chain reaction or by the cno cycle when the hydrogen fuel is exhausted nuclear fusion can continue with progressively heavier elements although the net energy released is lower because of the smaller difference in nuclear binding energy once iron-56 or nickel-56 nuclei are produced no further energy can be obtained by nuclear fusion as these have the highest nuclear binding energies the elements then on use up energy instead of giving off energy when fused therefore fusion stops and the star dies in attempts by humans fusion is only carried out with hydrogen isotope of 2 and 3 to form helium-4 as this reaction gives out the most net energy electric confinement iter inertial confinementheating by laser and heating by strong electric currents are the popular methods used 15 world tradeedit fuel imports in 2005 the world bank reported that the usa was the top fuel importer in 2005 followed by the eu and
