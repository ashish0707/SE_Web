or create a new article as appropriate september 2013 learn how and when to remove this template message energy subsidies are measures that keep prices for consumers below market levels or for producers above market levels or reduce costs for consumers and producers1 energy subsidies may be direct cash transfers to producers consumers or related bodies as well as indirect support mechanisms such as tax exemptions and rebates price controls trade restrictions and limits on market access they may also include energy conservation subsidies2 the development of todays major modern energy industries have all relied on substantial subsidy support fossil fuel subsidies reached 90 billion in the oecd and over 500 billion globally in 2011.3 global renewable energy subsidies reached 88 billion in 2011.4 taking into account the price difference offered to developing countries of the fossil fuels in many developing countries fossil fuels are sold below the regular price then as of 2015 fossil fuels are subsidised with an estimated additional 550 billion per year5 according to fatih birol chief economist at the international energy agency without a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies countries will not reach their climate targets6 researchers at the imf project that for 2015 the economic cost of total energy subsidies worldwide will amount to us53 trillion in 2015 or us10 million every minute7 this is not to be confused with actual amount of subsidies which are projected to amount to around us333 billion for 2015.8 this would be a decrease from 2014 which reflects the slump in oil prices rather than policy changes in may 2016 the g7 nations have for the first time set a deadline for the ending most fossil fuel subsidies saying government support for coal oil and gas should end by 2025.9 contents 1 overview 2 environmental impact of energy subsidies 3 iea position on subsidies 4 subsidies by country 4.1 united states 4.1.1 allocation of subsidies in the united states 4.1.2 united states government role in the development of new energy industries 4.2 venezuela 5 see also 6 references 7 external links overviewedit main arguments for energy subsidies are security of supply subsidies are used to ensure adequate domestic supply by supporting indigenous fuel production in order to reduce import dependency or supporting overseas activities of national energy companies environmental improvement subsidies are used to reduce pollution including different emissions and to fulfill international obligations eg kyoto protocol economic benefits subsidies in the form of reduced prices are used to stimulate particular economic sectors or segments of the population eg alleviating poverty and increasing access to energy in developing countries employment and social benefits subsidies are used to maintain employment especially in periods of economic transition10 main arguments against energy subsidies are some energy subsidies counter the goal of sustainable development as they may lead to higher consumption and waste exacerbating the harmful effects of energy use on the environment create a heavy burden on government finances and weaken the potential for economies to grow undermine private and public investment in the energy sector11 also most benefits from fossil fuel subsidies in developing countries go to the richest 20 of households3 impede the expansion of distribution networks and the development of more environmentally benign energy technologies and do not always help the people that need them most11 the study conducted by the world bank finds that subsidies to the large commercial businesses that dominate the energy sector are not justified however under some circumstances it is reasonable to use subsidies to promote access to energy for the poorest households in developing countries energy subsidies should encourage access to the modern energy sources not to cover operating costs of companies12 the study conducted by the world resources institute finds that energy subsidies often go to capital intensive projects at the expense of smaller or distributed alternatives13 types of energy subsidies are direct financial transfers grants to producers grants to consumers low-interest or preferential loans to producers preferential tax treatments rebates or exemption on royalties duties producer levies and tariffs tax credit accelerated depreciation allowances on energy supply equipment trade restrictions quota technical restrictions and trade embargoes energy-related services provided by government at less than full cost direct investment in energy infrastructure public research and development regulation of the energy sector demand guarantees and mandated deployment rates price controls market-access restrictions preferential planning consent and controls over access to resources failure to impose external costs environmental externality costs energy security risks and price volatility costs11 depletion allowance allows a deduction from gross income of up to 27 for the depletion of exhaustible resources oil gas minerals overall energy subsidies require coordination and integrated implementation especially in light of globalization and increased interconnectedness of energy policies thus their regulation at the world trade organization is often seen as necessary1415 environmental impact of energy subsidiesedit fossil fuel subsidies work against international efforts to reduce use of fossil fuels in order to control global warming16 according to the oecd subsidies supporting fossil fuels particularly coal and oil represent greater threats to the environment than subsidies to renewable energy subsidies to nuclear power contribute to unique environmental and safety issues related mostly to the risk of high-level environmental damage although nuclear power contributes positively to the environment in the areas of air pollution and climate change subsidies to renewable energy are generally considered more environmentally beneficial although the full range of environmental effects should to be taken into account17 a 2010 study by global subsidies initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 us cents per kwh of energy they produce although it should be noted that the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-oecd countries nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents kwh renewable energy excluding hydroelectricity receives 5.0 cents kwh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents kwh in subsidies18 in 2011 iea chief economist faith birol said the current 409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce co2 emissions19 in february 2011 and january 2012 the uk energy fair group supported by other organisations and environmentalists lodged formal complaints with the european unions directorate general for competition alleging that the government was providing unlawful state aid in the form of subsidies for nuclear power industry in breach of european union competition law2021 one of the largest subsidies is the cap on liabilities for nuclear accidents which the nuclear power industry has negotiated with governments like car drivers the operators of nuclear plants should be properly insured said gerry wolff coordinator of the energy fair group the group calculates that if nuclear operators were fully insured against the cost of nuclear disasters like those at chernobyl and fukushima the price of nuclear electricity would rise by at least 0.14 per kwh and perhaps as much as 2.36 depending on assumptions made22 iea position on subsidiesedit according to international energy agency iea 2011 energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits23 in november 2011 an iea report entitled deploying renewables 2011 said subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits the ieas report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support the iea said and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue24 fossil-fuel consumption subsidies were 409 billion in 2010 oil products being half of it renewable-energy subsidies were 66 billion in 2010 and will reach 250 billion by 2035 according to iea renewable energy is subsidized in order to compete in the market increase their volume and develop the technology so that the subsidies become unnecessary with the development eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could bring economic and environmental benefits phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 would cut primary energy demand 5 since the start of 2010 at least 15 countries have taken steps to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies according to iea onshore wind may become competitive around 2020 in the european union23 according to the iea the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies over 500 billion annually will reduce 10 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.25 subsidies by countryedit the international energy agency estimates that governments subsidised fossil fuels by us548 billion in 2013.26 ten countries accounted for almost three-quarters of this figure27 at their meeting in september 2009 the g-20 countries committed to rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption28 the 2010s have seen many countries reducing energy subsidies for instance in july 2014 ghana abolished all diesel and gasoline subsidies whilst in the same month egypt raised diesel prices 63 as part of a raft of reforms intended to remove subsidies within 5 years29 the public energy subsidies for energy in finland in 2013 were 700 million for fossil energy and 60 million for renewable energy mainly wood and wind30 united statesedit allocation of subsidies in the united statesedit on march 13 2013 terry m dinan senior advisor at the congressional budget office testified before the subcommittee on energy of the committee on science space and technology in the us house of representatives that federal energy tax subsidies would cost 16.4 billion that fiscal year broken down as follows renewable energy 7.3 billion 45 percent energy efficiency 4.8 billion 29 percent fossil fuels 3.2 billion 20 percent nuclear energy 1.1 billion 7 percent in addition dinan testified that the us department of energy would spend an additional 3.4 billion on financial support for energy technologies and energy efficiency broken down as follows energy efficiency and renewable energy 1.7 billion 51 percent nuclear energy 0.7 billion 22 percent fossil energy research development 0.5 billion 15 percent advanced research projects agencyenergy 0.3 billion 8 percent electricity delivery and energy reliability 0.1 billion 4 percent31 a 2011 study by the consulting firm management information services inc misi32 estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 19502010 the study found that oil natural gas and coal received 369 billion 121 billion and 104 billion 2010 dollars respectively or 70 of total energy subsidies over that period oil natural gas and coal benefited most from percentage depletion allowances and other tax-based subsidies but oil also benefited heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines the misi report found that non-hydro renewable energy primarily wind and solar benefited from 74 billion in federal subsidies or 9 of the total largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development rd nuclear power benefited from 73 billion in federal subsidies 9 of the total largely in the form of rd while hydro power received 90 billion in federal subsidies 12 of the total a 2009 study by the environmental law institute33 assessed the size and structure of us energy subsidies in 200208 the study estimated that subsidies to fossil fuel-based sources totaled about 72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled 29 billion the study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy the three largest fossil fuel subsidies were foreign tax credit 15.3 billion credit for production of non-conventional fuels 14.1 billion oil and gas exploration and development expensing 7.1 billion the three largest renewable fuel subsidies were alcohol credit for fuel excise tax 11.6 billion renewable electricity production credit 5.2 billion corn-based ethanol 5.0 billion in the united states the federal government has paid us74 billion for energy subsidies to support rd for nuclear power 50 billion and fossil fuels 24 billion from 1973 to 2003 during this same timeframe renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of us26 billion it has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors namely solar power wind power and biofuels34 however many of the subsidies available to the oil and gas industries are general business opportunity credits available to all us businesses particularly the foreign tax credit mentioned above the value of industry-specific oil gas and coal subsidies in 2006 was estimated by the texas state comptroller to be 6.25 billion - about 60 of the amount calculated by the environmental law institute35 the balance of federal subsides which the comptroller valued at 7.4 billion came from shared credits and deductions and oil defense spending on the strategic petroleum reserve energy infrastructure security etc critics allege that the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry have not involved cash payments but rather the shifting of construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns defaults to accidents and nuclear waste management critics claim that this approach distorts market choices which they believe would otherwise favor less risky energy investments36 many energy analysts such as clint wilder ron pernick and lester brown have suggested that energy subsidies need to be shifted away from mature and established industries and towards high growth clean energy they also suggest that such subsidies need to be reliable long-term and consistent to avoid the periodic difficulties that the wind industry has had in the united states3437 a 2012 study authored by researchers at the breakthrough institute brookings institution and world resources institute38 estimated that between 2009 and 2014 the federal government will spend 150 billion on clean energy through a combination of direct spending and tax expenditures renewable electricity mainly wind solar geothermal hydro and tidal energy will account for the largest share of this expenditure 32.1 while spending on liquid biofuels will account for the next largest share 16.1 spending on multiple and other forms of clean energy including energy efficiency electric vehicles and advanced batteries high-speed rail grid and transportation electrification nuclear and advanced fossil fuel technologies will account for the remaining share 51.8 moreover the report finds that absent federal action spending on clean energy will decline by 75 from 44.3 billion in 2009 to 11.0 billion in 2014 united states government role in the development of new energy industriesedit from civilian nuclear power to hydro wind solar and shale gas the united states federal government has played a central role in the development of new energy industries39 americas nuclear power industry which currently supplies about 20 of the countrys electricity has its origins in the manhattan project to develop atomic weapons during world war ii from 1942 to 1945 the united states invested 20 billion 2003 dollars into a massive nuclear research and deployment initiative but the achievement of the first nuclear weapon test in 1945 marked the beginning not the end of federal involvement in nuclear technologies president dwight d eisenhowers atoms for peace address in 1953 and the 1954 atomic energy act committed the united states to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology including commercial energy generation the new national laboratory system established by the manhattan project was maintained and expanded and the government poured money into nuclear energy research and development40 recognizing that research was not sufficient to spur the development of a nascent capital-intensive industry the federal government created financial incentives to spur the deployment of nuclear energy for example the 1957 price anderson act limited the liability of nuclear energy firms in case of serious accident and helped firms secure capital with federal loan guarantees in the favorable environment created by such incentives more than 100 nuclear plants were built in the united states by 1973.40 commercial wind power today one of the fastest growing energy sectors was also enabled through government support in the 1980s the federal government pursued two different rd efforts for wind turbine development the first was a big science effort by nasa and the department of energy doe to use us expertise in high-technology research and products to develop new large-scale wind turbines for electricity generation largely from scratch41 a second more successful rd effort sponsored by the doe focused on component innovations for smaller turbines that used the operational experience of existing turbines to inform future research agendas joint research projects between the government and private firms produced a number of innovations that helped increase the efficiency of wind turbines including twisted blades and special-purpose airfoils publicly funded rd was coupled with efforts to build a domestic market for new turbines at the federal level this included tax credits and the passage of the public utilities regulatory policy act purpa which required that utilities purchase power from some small renewable energy generators at avoided cost41 both federal and state support for wind turbine development helped drive costs down considerably but policy incentives at both the federal and state level were discontinued at the end of the decade41 however after a nearly five-year federal policy hiatus in the late 1980s the us government enacted new policies to support the industry in the early 1990s the national renewable energy laboratory nrel continued its support for wind turbine rd and also launched the advanced wind turbine program awtp the goal of the awtp was to reduce the cost of wind power to rates that would be competitive in the us market policymakers also introduced new mechanisms to spur the demand of new wind turbines and boost the domestic market including a 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour tax credit adjusted over time for inflation included in the 1992 energy policy act today the wind industrys main subsidy support comes from the federal production tax credit the development of commercial solar power was also dependent on government support solar pv technology was born in the united states when daryl chapin calvin fuller and gerald pearson at bell labs first demonstrated the silicon solar photovoltaic cell in 1954.42 the first cells recorded efficiencies of four percent far lower than the 25 percent efficiencies typical of some silicon crystalline cells today with the cost out of reach for most applications developers of the new technology had to look elsewhere for an early market as it turned out solar pv did make economic sense in one market segment aerospace the united states army and air force viewed the technology as an ideal power source for a top-secret project on earth-orbiting satellites the government contracted with hoffman electronics to provide solar cells for its new space exploration program the first commercial satellite the vanguard i launched in 1958 was equipped with both silicon solar cells and chemical batteries42 by 1965 nasa was using almost a million solar pv cells strong government demand and early research support for solar cells paid off in the form of dramatic declines in the cost of the technology and improvements in its performance from 1956 to 1973 the price of pv cells declined from 300 to 20 per watt42 beginning in the 1970s as costs were declining manufacturers began producing solar pv cells for terrestrial applications solar pv found a new niche in areas distant from power lines where electricity was needed such as oil rigs and coast guard lighthouses the government continued to support the industry through the 1970s and early 1980s with new rd efforts under presidents richard nixon and gerald ford both republicans and president jimmy carter a democrat as a direct result of government involvement in solar pv development 13 of the 14 top innovations in pv over the past three decades were developed with the help of federal dollars nine of which were fully funded by the public sector43 more recently than nuclear wind or solar the development of the shale gas industry and subsequent boom in shale gas development in the united states was enabled through government support4445 the history of shale gas fracking in the united states was punctuated by the successive developments of massive hydraulic fracturing mhf microseismic imaging horizontal drilling and other key innovations that when combined made the once unreachable energy resource technically recoverable along each stage of the innovation pipeline from basic research to applied rd to cost-sharing on demonstration projects to tax policy support for deployment public-private partnerships and federal investments helped push hydraulic fracturing in shale into full commercial competitiveness through a combination of federally funded geologic research beginning in the 1970s public-private collaboration on demonstration project and rd priorities and tax policy support for unconventional technologies the federal government played a key role in the development of shale gas in the united states investigations have uncovered the crucial role of the government in the development of other energy technologies and industries including aviation and jet engines synthetic fuels39 advanced natural gas turbines46 and advanced diesel internal combustion engines47 venezuelaedit in venezuela the subsidizing of fossil fuels has caused the creation of a huge black market criminal groups smuggle fuel over the border mainly to colombia this is due to the large profits that can be gained by this act as fuel is much more expensive in colombia than in venezuela despite the fact that this issue is all ready well known in venezuela and insecurity in the region continues to rise the state has not yet raised or eliminated these fossil fuel subsidies48495051 see alsoedit corporate welfare
