sam net power output coming only from the solar source is around 75 mwe  representing a 21 capacity factor in addition the turbines can be utilized at night by burning natural gas nextera claims that the solar plants power 232,500 homs during the day at peak power and displace 3,800tons of pollution pr year that would have been produced if the electricity had bn providd by fossil fuels such as oil3 the facilities have a total of 936,384 mirrors and cover more than 1,600 acres 647.5ha lined up the parabolic mirrors would extend over 229 miles 369km as an example of cost in 2002 one of the 30 mw kramer junction sites required 90 million to construct and its operation and maintenance cost was about 3 million per year 4.6 cents per kilowatt hour4 with a considered lifetime of 20 years the operation maintenance and investments interest and depreciation triples the price to approximately 14 cents per kilowatt hourcitation needed principle of operationedit sketch of a parabolic trough collector the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity about 90 of the electricity is produced by the sunlightcitation needed natural gas is only used when the solar power is insufficient to meet the demand from southern california edison the distributor of power in southern california mirrorsedit the parabolic mirrors are shaped like quarter-pipes the sun shines onto the panels made of glass which are 94reflective unlike a typical mirror which is only 70reflective the mirrors automatically track the sun throughout the day the greatest source of mirror breakage is wind with 3,000 mirrors typically replaced each year operators can turn the mirrors to protect them during intense wind storms an automated washing mechanism is used to periodically clean the parabolic reflective panels heat transferedit the sunlight bounces off the mirrors and is directed to a central tube filled with synthetic oil which heats to over 400c 750f the reflected light focused at the central tube is 71 to 80times more intense than the ordinary sunlight the synthetic oil transfers its heat to water which boils and drives the rankine cycle steam turbine5 thereby generating electricity synthetic oil is used to carry the heat instead of water to keep the pressure within manageable parameters individual locationsedit the segs power plants were built by luz industries56 and commissioned between december 20 1984 and october 1 1990.7 after luz industries bankruptcy in 1991 plants were sold to various investor groups as individual projects
