municipal police were established in 1845 replacing an old night watch system in 1857 it was tumultuously replaced by a metropolitan force which consolidated many other local police departments in 1898 twentieth-century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption rank structureedit this section discusses ranks of the nypd as a whole the school safety division traffic control division auxiliary police section and police academy have their own rank and grade structures despite being part of the nypd and commanded by officers of the nypd proper command structure officers begin service with the rank of probationary police officer also referred to as recruit officer after successful completion of six months of police academy training and various academic physical and tactical tests officers graduate from the police academy while officially retaining the title of probationary police officer graduates are referred to as a police officer or informally as a rookie until they have completed an additional 18 months probationary period there are three career tracks in the nypd supervisory investigative and specialist the supervisory track consists of 12 sworn titles referred to as ranks promotion to the ranks of sergeant lieutenant and captain are made via competitive civil service examinations promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector inspector deputy chief assistant chief and chief are made at the discretion of the police commissioner after successfully passing a series of civil service exams promotion from the rank of police officer to detective is determined by the current police labor contract with the approval of the commissioner the entry level appointment to detective is third grade or specialist the commissioner may grant discretionary grades of first or second these grades offer compensation roughly equivalent to that of supervisors specifically a second grade detectives pay roughly corresponds to a sergeants and a first grade detectives pay roughly corresponds to a lieutenants detectives are police officers who have been given a more investigatory position but no official supervisory authority a detective first grade still falls under the command of a sergeant or above just like detectives sergeants and lieutenants can receive pay grade increases within their respective ranks title insignia badge design

basic types of detective in the nypd detective-investigators and detective-specialists detective-investigators are the type most people associate with the term detective and are the ones most frequently portrayed on television and in the movies most police officers gain their detective title by working in the narcotics division of the organized crime control bureau and are then moved to the detective bureau detectives assigned to squads are co-located within each precinct and are responsible for investigating murders rapes robberies burglaries and other crimes within that precincts boundaries other detective-investigators are assigned to specialized units at either the major command or citywide level investigating terrorist groups organized crime narcotics dealing extortion bias crimes political corruption kidnappings major frauds or thefts committed against banks or museums police corruption contractor fraud and other complex politically sensitive or high-profile cases a squad of detective-investigators is also assigned to each of the citys five district attorneys offices arsons are investigated by the arson and explosion squad as well as fire marshals who are part of the new york city fire department promotion from police officer to detective-investigator is based on investigative experience typically a police officer who is assigned to investigative work for 18 months will be designated detective-investigator and receive the gold shield and pay increase commensurate with that designation in the recent past however there has been controversy over the budget-conscious department compelling police officers to work past the 18 months without receiving the new title newly appointed detectives start at detective third grade which has a pay rate roughly between that of police officer and sergeant as they gain seniority and experience they can be promoted to detective second-grade which has a pay grade slightly less than sergeants detective first-grade is an elite designation for the departments most senior and experienced investigators and carries a pay grade slightly less than lieutenants all these promotions are discretionary on the part of the commissioner and can be revoked if warranted and while senior detectives can give directions to junior detectives in their own squads not even the most senior detective can lawfully issue orders to even a junior patrol officer all detective grades still fall under the chain of command of the supervisory ranks beginning with sergeant through chief of department detectives like police officers are eligible to take the promotional civil service exams for entry into the supervisory ranks a lieutenant white shirt debriefing officers at times square in may 2010 while carrying with them increased pay and prestige none of these detective grades confer on the holder any supervisory authority contrary to some media portrayals there is no specific rank of detective sergeant or detective lieutenant lieutenants and sergeants are assigned to oversee detective squads as supervisors and are responsible for all investigations there is a small percentage of lieutenants and sergeants who work as investigative supervisors approximately equal to 10 of their respective ranks and are granted the prestigious pay grade designations of sergeantsupervisor detective squad sds or lieutenantcommander detective squad cds therefore assuming full investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision their pay grade rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest ranks pay grade and similar to a detectives grade is also a discretionary promotion this pay grade designation is achieved by assignment to investigative units ie detective bureau internal affairs bureau counter-terrorism bureau intelligence bureau and organized crime control bureau lieutenants and sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated lieutenant-special assignment or sergeant-special assignment pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts detective-specialists are a relatively new designation and one unique to the nypd in the 1980s many detectives resented that some officers were being granted the rank of detective in order to give them increased pay and status but were not being assigned to investigative duties examples included officers assigned as bodyguards and drivers to the mayor police commissioner and other senior officials to remedy this situation the rank of detective-specialist was created these officers are typically found in specialized units because they possess a unique or esoteric skill the department needs eg crime-scene tech sharpshooter bomb technician scuba instructor helicopter instructor sketch artist etc like detective-investigators detective-specialists start at third-grade and can be promoted to second- or first-grade status a nypd motorcycle police officer speaks with a passerby in 2008 the department is administered and governed by the police commissioner who is appointed by the mayor technically the commissioner serves a five-year term as a practical matter the commissioner serves at the mayors pleasure the commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners the commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law however a police commissioner who comes up from the uniformed ranks retains that status while serving as police commissioner this has ramifications for their police pensions and the fact that any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm and does retain the statutory powers of a police officer some police commissioners like ray kelly do carry a personal firearm but they also have a full-time security detail from the police commissioners detective squad a first deputy police commissioner may have a security detail when heshe acts as commissioner or under other circumstances as approved by the police commissioner commissioner titles title insignia police commissioner first deputy commissioner deputy commissioner these individuals are administrators who supersede the chief of department and they usually specialize in areas of great importance to the department such as counterterrorism operations training public information legal matters intelligence and information technology despite their role as civilian administrators of the department deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation the commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations however within the rank structure there are also designations known as grades that connote differences in duties experience and pay however supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above badges in the new york city police department are referred to as shields the traditional term though not all badge designs are strictly shield-shaped every rank has a different badge design with the exception of police officer and probationary police officer and upon change in rank officers receive a new badge lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers and tax registry number lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry number all sworn members of the nypd have their id card photos taken against a red background civilian employees of the nypd have
