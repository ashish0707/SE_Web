kwh redirects here for other uses see kwh disambiguation residential electricity meter located in canada the kilowatt hour symbol kwh1 is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6megajoules.23 if the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate power over a period of time the total energy in kilowatt hours is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in hours the kilowatt hour is

average rate of one thousand watts for one hour the base unit of energy within the international system of units si is the joule the hour is a unit of time outside the si making the kilowatt hour a non-si unit of energy the kilowatt hour is not listed among the non-si units accepted by the bipm for use with the si although the hour from which the kilowatt hour is derived is4 examplesedit an electric heater rated at 1000 watts 1 kilowatt operating for one hour uses one kilowatt hour equivalent to 3.6 megajoules of energy a television rated at 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt hour a 40-watt light bulb operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt hour electrical energy is sold in kilowatt hours cost of running equipment is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours and price per kilowatt hour the unit price of electricity may depend upon the rate of consumption and the time of day industrial users may also have extra charges according to their peak usage and the power factor symbol and abbreviations for kilowatt houredit the symbol kwh is commonly used in commercial educational scientific and media publications5 and is the usual practice in electrical power engineering6 other abbreviations and symbols may be encountered kw h is less commonly used it is consistent with si standards but note that the kilowatt-hour is a non-si unit the international standard for si4 states that in forming a compound unit symbol multiplication must be indicated by a space or a half-high centered dot  since otherwise some prefixes could be misinterpreted as a unit symbol ie kw h or kwh this is supported by a voluntary standard7 issued jointly by an international ieee and national astm organization however at least one major usage guide8 and the ieeeastm standard allow kwh but do not mention other multiples of the watt hour one guide published by nist specifically recommends avoiding kwh to avoid possible confusion9 kwh is like kw h preferred with si standards but it is very rarely used in practice the us official fuel-economy window sticker for electric vehicles uses the abbreviation kw-hrs10 variations in capitalization are sometimes seen kwh kwh kwh etc these are inconsistent with international system of units the notation kwh as a symbol for kilowatt-hour is not correct conversionsedit

energy and kilowatts poweredit the terms power and energy are frequently confused power is defined as the rate of delivery of energy the work performed per unit time measured in units joules per second or watts to produce power over any period of time requires energy either higher levels of power for a given period or longer periods of run time at a given power level require more energy an electrical load eg a lamp tv-set electric motor has a rated size in watts this is its running power level which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to run the device the amount of energy that is consumed at that rate depends on how long the device is operated however its power requirements are constant while running the unit of energy for residential electrical billing kilowatt hours integrates changing power levels in use at the residence over the past billing period which is nominally 720 hours for a 30-day month thus showing cumulative electrical energy use for the month for another example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 watts is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100 watt hours wh 0.1 kilowatt hour or 360 kilojoules this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5 hours or a 10-watt low-energy bulb for 10 hours a power station electricity output at any particular moment would be measured in multiples of watts but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watt hours a kilowatt hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour or 3.6 megajoules energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example a 100-watt ie 0.1 kilowatt light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800wh or 0.8kwh if the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt hour it would cost 0.1kw 8h 0.25kwh 0.20 whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt hours consumed commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time such as 15 minutes this compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power these charges are billed as demand charges11 major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours twh for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year one terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year misuse of watts per houredit power units measure the rate of energy per unit time many compound units for rates explicitly mention units of time for example miles per hour kilometers per hour dollars per hour kilowatt-hours are a product of power and time not a rate of change of power with time watts per hour wh is a unit of a change of power per hour it might be used to characterize the ramp-up behavior of power plants for example a power plant that reaches a power output of 1mw from 0mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4mwh hydroelectric power plants have a very high ramp-up rate which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations the proper use of terms such as watts per hour is uncommon whereas misuse12 may be widespread other energy-related unitsedit several other units are commonly used to indicate power or energy capacity or use in specific application areas average annual power production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatt hours per year for example when comparing the energy efficiency of household appliances whose power consumption varies with time or the season of the year or the energy produced by a distributed power source one kilowatt hour per year equals about 114.08 milliwatts applied constantly during one year the energy content of a battery is usually expressed indirectly by its capacity in ampere-hours to convert watt hours wh to ampere hour ah the watt-hour value must be divided by the voltage of the power source this value is approximate since the voltage is not constant during discharge of a battery and because higher discharge rates reduce the total amount of energy the battery can provide in the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery it is the battery voltage typically 3.7 for li-ion that must be used to calculate rather than the device output usually 5.0 for usb portable chargers since use of the lower figure allows manufacturers of such devices to overstate the capacity or run-time inflating it by 35 53.71.35 this results in a 500ma usb device running for only about 3.7 hours on a 2500mah battery rather than the expected five hours the board of trade unit botu is an obsolete uk synonym for kilowatt hour the term derives from the name of the board of trade which regulated the electricity industry until 1942 when the ministry of power took over13 the botu should not be confused with the british thermal unit or btu which is a much smaller quantity of thermal energy in india the kilowatt hour is often simply called a unit of energy a million units designated mu is a gigawatt hour and a bu billion units is a terawatt hour1415 burnup of nuclear fuel is normally quoted in megawatt days per tonne mwdmtu where tonne refers to a metric ton of uranium metal or its equivalent and megawatt refers to the entire thermal output not the fraction which is converted to electricitycitation needed see
