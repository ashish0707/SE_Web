for mazda north american operations35 the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development123 the model s was announced in a press release on june 30 2008.3637 the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26 2009.38 in february 2008 it was reported that tesla motors was planning to offer a range-extended version of its model s this version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle39 but it was removed in later revisions at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 teslas ceo elon musk announced that tesla was developing only electric cars40 construction of an assembly factory in albuquerque new mexico a central location for shipping was supposed to begin in april 2007 but was cancelled41 a factory to be built in san jose california was also announced424344 in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former nummi assembly plant in fremont california45 now known as the tesla factory this third plan was implemented the first production tesla model s with owner tesla board member steve jurvetson in june 2015 three years after the cars market release in june 2015 three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75,000 model s sedans delivered worldwide tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles 1.6 billion km traveled and saved more than half a million tons of co24647 the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles over 1 billion kilometers out of a total of 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles 1 billion kilometers47 tesla also reported that 68 of model s travel took place in north america 25 in europe and 7 in asia-pacific47 global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015.21 in 2016 a racing series called the electric gt world series was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85 as a race car on certain traditional tracks the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams48 in april 2016 a refresh model s was introduced the front fascia has with a similar design as the model x and also adaptive led headlights were introduced also the improved model s has a hepa air filtration system that removes at least 99.97 of particulate exhaust pollution and all allergens bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air the standard charger was upgraded from 40 to 48 amps in order to enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets two new interior choices were added figured ash wood and dark ash wood these improvements were accompanied by a us1500 price increase in the base model49 productionedit main article tesla factory tesla model s manufacturing process a tesla model s being manufactured at the tesla factory tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot50 tesla factory in fremont california for the european market tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in tilburg the netherlands51 cars are built and tested in fremont california the battery pack the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg where the cars are reassembled52 the center occupies a 203,000sqft 18,900m2 industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse tesla expects the model s to pay back the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles 16,000km.53 the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22 2012 at the official launch54 production grew from 1520 cars completedweek in august 201254 to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015.55 in october 2015 tesla motors announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third56 a model s starts at us71500 in the us while in china pricing starts at cn673000 about us106000 after duties and other taxes57 elon musk clarified that production will remain in the us but if theres sufficient local demand for the tesla model 3 in china a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model production in europe will also depend on the regions demand for the model 3.58 designedit model s chassis on display at santana row in san jose california the model s exists in several versions differing in energy capacity battery size power motor size and equipment it is classified as a fullsize luxury car in the usa or as a large car59 120 cu ft or more or luxury sedan60 by the epa the euro car segment classification is s-segment sports car6162 or oberklasse in germany63 powertrainedit cutaway view of a tesla model s drive motor a tesla model s p85 using regenerative braking power in excess of 60kw during regenerative braking the power indicator is green the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a three phase four pole ac induction 416hp 310kw and 443ftlb 600nm rear-mounted electric motor with copper rotor64 the base model uses a 362hp 270kw and 325ftlb 440nm motor the company claimed a drag coefficient of cd02465 lower than any car when released 66 independent measurement by car and driver in may 2014 bore out teslas claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of cd02467 the rear axle has a traditional open differential models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled electronically68 the model s p90d has a top speed of 155mph 249kmh and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97kmh in 2.8 seconds despite the lower total motor power in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain the model s p85d a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a governed top speed of 155mph 249kmh69 and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97kmh in 3.2 seconds tested to 3.1 seconds under insane mode with 1g of acceleration6970 new p85ds have an optional ludicrous mode hardware package available with the 90 kwh battery upgrade thus becoming a p90d that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97kmh acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g.717273 tesla initially reported the total output in the p85d as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691hp 515kw but later reported it as 463hp 345kw because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time74 the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime owners reported many powertrain issues from 2012 improving significantly over the years75 in july 2015 tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles76 dual-motor all-wheel-drive versionsedit on october 9 2014 tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive awd versions of the model ss 60 85 and p85 models designated by a d at the end of the model number777879 on april 8 2015 tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us75000 entry-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles 385km the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase the p85 option was also dropped8081 in the 85d the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels this results in an awd car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us5000 additionally the 85d reports a 2 5-mile range increase and 11 increase in top speed over the 8582 presumably due to incremental improvements in hardware and software in the p85d the high-power rear drive unit is retained while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50 this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed the 85kwh version rose from us81070 to us86070 while the p85 now the p85d jumped from us94570 to us105670 deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014 with the 85d models starting in february 2015 and the 70d models starting in april 2015.78 on june 9 2016 tesla reintroduced the 60 and 60d which has a 75kwh battery locked out to 60kwh83 but upgradable by software as is the autopilot option the spring refresh of 2016 also offers the bioweapon defense mode airfilter first offered on the model x84 on august 23 2016 tesla introduced the model s p100d with ludicrous mode as its new us134500 top-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved epa estimated range of 315 miles 505km.34 this version of the model s is notable for being the first electric vehicle to have a us epa estimated range greater than 300 miles 485km and for being the fastest accelerating vehicle currently in production with a 060mph 097kmh time of 2.5 seconds when optioned with ludicrous mode8586 batteryedit external images speed-dependent ranges of various model s speed-dependent ranges roadster model s cylindrical cell 18650 prior to assembly several thousand of them form the tesla model s battery see gigafactory in 2012 the epa range for the 60kwh battery pack model was 208mi 335km87 and the 85kwh battery was 265 miles 426km.1288 according to musk the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf but the difference in range is more than double this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient weight engine efficiency and rolling resistance89 musk stated that driving at 65mph 105kmh under normal conditions gives a reasonable range of 250 miles 400km.90 the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics after the car goes to sleep this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable this mode can decrease the

us44000 in february 2015.102 the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles 200,000km in metric countries for the base model with the 60kwh battery pack the 85kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles103104 a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5 after 30,000 miles 50,000km,10575 decreasing further about 1 per additional 30,000 miles unlike nissan tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss but some early battery packs have been replaced102106 a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us10000 for the 60kwh battery and us12000 for the 85kwh battery107 in 2013 tesla canceled a 40kwh version of the car due to lack of demand stating that only 4 of pre-orders were for the 40kwh battery option customers who ordered this option instead received the 60kwh pack with charge software-limited to 40kwh 139 miles 224km108 it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60kwh for us11000109 on april 8 2015 tesla motors discontinued the model s 60 and replaced the base model with the model s 70.110 in 2015 tesla introduced a 70kwh battery to replace the existing 60kwh batteries and base 60kwh model s vehicles as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers111112 all 70kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive113 the 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75 upgradable to 75 in july 2015 tesla introduced its 70 90 90d and p90d variants along with a ludicrous mode for the performance model the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower 193kw and rear axle power of 503 horsepower 375kw to a total of 762 horsepower 568kw for a 060mph time of 2.8 sec the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1g described by tesla as faster than falling76 the ludicrous mode costs us10000 for p90d but was discounted to us5000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016.114 in july 2015 tesla introduced its 90 and p90d a range upgrade of the 85 variants with a 90kwh battery and explained the 6 energy increase with improved cell chemistry76 and with the introduction of silicon into the graphite cell anode115 tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5 tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced inconel battery contactors116 and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse which monitors the current at the millisecond level cuts the power with extreme precision and certainty and has a rating of 1,500a.76 tesla model s showing the front trunk where the engine would be in a typical car tesla motors calls this a frunk117 in february 2016 the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the us australia and canada118 in march 2016 media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s has support for a yet to come p100d variant119 this battery is more complicated to make than the 90 version120 the p100d was released in august 2016.34 practicality and livabilityedit the model s is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor121 as a result the model s is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk frunk in addition to a spacious rear trunk with a capacity of 894 liters and a greatly enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle85 to enhance livability tesla has developed a network of fast-charging supercharger stations that allow the driver to quickly and easily top-up the charge on their model s85 this supercharger network has rapidly expanded in europe across the united states and other countries where the there is significant demand and as of september 2016update the network has been established in most american states thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety85 see the supercharger section below for further information researchers from the university of california davis conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles bev such as the tesla model s as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream bevs the 2016 study found that environmental performance and technological motivations are reasons for adoption the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market and financial purchase incentives are not important

pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles providing the vehicle with several advantages most notably since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle the model s has a center of gravity height of only 18 inches 46cm92131 about the same as a lotus elise132 helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g133 and good protection against rollover134135 secondly the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight thirdly the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment improving the passive safety of the vehicle136 fourth placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds137 either for maintenance or for teslas battery swap service chargeredit the model s charge port is located in

double wishbone virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink64 as an extra-cost option the car is available with self-leveling height-adjustable air suspension this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase141 because in the tesla electronic systems can be upgraded by over-the-air download rather than recall the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions during the 2013 fire investigation nhtsa asked tesla to disable the cars ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris142 in september 2014 tesla upgraded the height adjustment feature for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways and automatically adjusts to avoid them143 autopilotedit main article tesla autopilot see also autonomous car and connected car beginning in late september 2014 all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera supplied by mobileye mounted at the top of the windshield forward looking radar supplied by bosch144145 in the lower grill and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car this equipment allows model s to detect road signs lane markings obstacles and other vehicles in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning a us2500 tech package option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities146147148 all model s sold since october 2014 have the option to have autopilot which allows limited hands-free driving autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly some people agreed that tesla autopilot can reduce accidents due negligence and fatigue in long range drive use149 according to elon musk the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company a huge part of what tesla is is a silicon valley software company we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop150 full autonomy is really a software limitation the hardware exists to create full autonomy so its really about developing advanced narrow ai for the car to operate on151152 teslas autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars and its autopilot can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the us department of transportations national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa five levels of vehicle automation at this level the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver who must be prepared to take control at a moments notice153154155 autopilot is suitable only on limited-access highways and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists156 starting october 2016 all tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level sae level 5.157 the system will operate in shadow mode processing without taking action and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades158 tesla motors says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017 after proper testing157 fatal accidentedit the first known fatal accident involving a tesla model s when the car was in autopilot mode took place in williston florida on 7 may 2016 the driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer by late june 2016 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the florida highway patrol according to the nhtsa preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer159160161 the nhtsas preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 model s cars162 on 8 july 2016 the nhtsa requested tesla motors to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and teslas planned updates scheduled for the next four months163 according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s tesla also stated that this was teslas first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles 208 million km driven by its customers where autopilot was activated according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles 150 million km among all type of vehicles in the us159160164 some statisticians say that teslas use of statistics is meaningless due to the relatively small total distance traveled by tesla cars and the different driving conditions of the two data sets being compared it is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before a statistically significant comparison can be made researchers say that tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if self-driving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use165 instrument paneledit production dashboard with main dashboard digital display left and central 17-inch 430mm touchscreen control panel right the instrument panel is a 12.3-inch 31cm liquid-crystal display electronic instrument cluster that indicates speed power usage charge level estimated range and active

areas a top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to charging homelink driver profiles vehicle information software version and the vehicle identification number and bluetooth the second line provides access to several apps including media nav driven by google maps and thus is separate from the nav on instrument panel energy web camera and phone the central main viewing area displays the two active apps subdivided into upper and lower areas most apps can be expanded to take up the entire area at the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control the instrument cluster and the infotainment panel are driven by separate nvidia tegra 3 3d visual computing modules166167 tesla was the first company to ship this technology audi later delivered this technology in its 2013 model year in europe and in north america in 2014.168 the tegra system on a chip soc integrates eight specialized processors including a multi-core arm cpu a gpu and dedicated audio video and image processors nvidia claimed that it consumes 2 of the energy of a typical cpu169 the navigation system uses gps and a mix of garmin and google maps route guidance the map display on the 17-inch screen requires a constant internet connection so navigation is limited in areas without mobile network coverage the nav on the instrument panel is loaded on the car and does not need internet access to function170 update 6.2 features automatic nav guidance to charging stations if range is insufficient171 enthusiasts have developed the open vehicle monitoring system ovms which allows the owner to remotely observe a variety of different vehicle operating parameters such as battery state of charge typically using a smartphone some switchgear used are mercedes parts such as window switches cruise control lever and drive selector according to elon musk the model s runs on the open-source linux operating system172 in 2014 autoblog reported that tesla models s owners had determined via the cars combined diagnostics and ethernet port that a ubuntu system controlling the central touchscreen is connected to the cars internal ethernet173 the same users determined that another ubuntu system controlling the dashboardnavigation screen also is connected to the internal network together with a third computer of unknown type with an unknown function174 featuresedit the model s has an optional folding third row with rear-facing seats for two children secured with a racing-style five-point harness the model s key all versions of the model s have the same body and normally seat five passengers an optional folding third row for us2500 becomes a rear-facing two-place child seat the option includes a stronger rear bumper131135 each third row seat has a racing-style five-point harness for passengers over 37in 0.94m tall and weighing between 35 to 77lb 16 to 35kg cargo space is available under the front hood which tesla called a frunk a portmanteau of front trunk the optional third row gives the greatest passenger capacity of any electric vehicle175 in october 2014 the upgraded model s p85d d for dual was introduced176 the upgraded version features two electric motors one driving the rear wheels as in prior versions and one driving the front wheels safety features are enhanced also for example with partial auto-pilot functions the dual motor version will be available also for the basic 85 kwh versions for around us4000 more in price the rear wheel drive version of the p85 was removed and the dual motor option is not available for the 60 kwh version80 the 2015 model year update introduced electromechanical brakes177 in 2016 the 85kwh and later 90kwh battery was discontinued from all markets a glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the b-pillars was introduced in late 2016.178 vehicle warranty and maintenanceedit the model s is covered by a 4-year 50,000mi 80,000km limited warranty179 that includes all standard equipment the transmission and the complete powertrain excluding tires180 the warranty can be extended an additional 4 years or 50,000 miles 80,000km beyond the original terms for us4000180 warranty coverage includes a complementary loaner cara performance 85 or tesla roadsterwhen service is required181 in april 2013 tesla announced that a previously mandatory us600 annual vehicle inspection and maintenance fee would be made optional and would not be required to maintain warranty coverage181 if chosen the fee covers a complete inspection tire alignment new brake pads hardware upgrades and miscellaneous other maintenance items as needed the battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125,000 miles 200,000km in metric countries for the 60kwh base model or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85kwh models103182 the unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage even including user error183 however loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warrantyclarification needed182184 environmental footprintedit in february 2014 the automotive science group asg published the result of a study conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in north america the study ranked the model s as the best environmental performer in the 2014 full-size cars category185 based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation for the assessment the study used the average electricity mix of the us grid in 2014 the nissan leaf had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the north american market186 in 2015 the union of concerned scientists found that in the us regions where the model s is popular the 68 higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving during their life-cycle evs emit about half the amount of comparable fossil cars187188 according to an ibm researcher this analysis is the best available189 tesla has worked with toxcokinsbursky in the us since 2008 and umicore in europe190 to

original battery pack fully charged on the return trip which is included in the swap fee tesla would also offer the option to keep the swapped battery for a fee or to receive the original pack from tesla for a fee pricing has not been determined209 teslas only battery swap station is located at harris ranch california and was available for pilot testing in late december 2014.211 as of 2015update tesla says they have hundreds of cars in the battery swap program although few owners are interested in using the service212 in june 2015 tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added due to lack of demand for battery swaps costing around 60 when supercharging is included free with most models213 editionsedit tesla allocated the first 1,000 units to its

estimated that about 2,800 tesla model s cars have been imported to china by mid september 2014 but only 432 had received the license plates292 according to a tesla spokesman the major reasons for the discrepancy could be that registration rules were holding deliveries in shanghai and tesla only recently was able to start delivering the electric cars to customers who bought them in shanghai

the first widely reported model s fire occurred several minutes after the vehicle hit metal debris on the washington state route 167 highway in kent washington on october 1 2013.372 the driver was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury373 he then contacted authorities and while awaiting their arrival smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the hov lane372374375 tesla stated that the fire was caused by the direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules and that by design the modules were separated by firewalls limiting the fire to a small section in the front of the vehicle372 the module was evidently punctured by a curved section that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch 76mm diameter hole through the 25-inch 6.4mm armor plate under the vehicle applying force of some 25 tons built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment according to tesla the firefighters followed standard procedure using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct376 however puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk373 tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains only about 10 of the energy contained in a gasoline tank the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1 that of a conventional vehicle373 on october 24 2013 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa announced after reviewing all available data the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards377 but the following month the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles378379 on march 28 2014 nhtsa closed its investigation claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates along with increased ground clearance should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk380 subsequent firesedit on november 6 2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a tow hitch on the roadway causing damage beneath the vehicle381 the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed378382 another fire incident took place in toronto canada in early february 2014 the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started the origin of the fire is undetermined383 according to tesla in this particular case we dont yet know the precise cause but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery the charging system the adapter or the electrical receptacle as these components were untouched by the fire384 starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014update all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service385386 on 1 january 2016 a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured387388389 the fire was slow and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions390 an investigation by the norwegian accident investigation board aibn indicated that the fire originated in the car but was otherwise inconclusive391 in march 2016 tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicles distribution box but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause390 tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected392 recallsedit on november 20 2015 tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90,000 model s vehicles in order to check for a possible defect in the cars front seat belt assemblies the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe teslas resulting investigation was unable to

85 kwh model could do it by driving at a constant 36mph 58kmh under ideal conditions422 controversiesedit range limitationedit on february 8 2013 the new york times published a review by john m broder about a trip between washington dc and boston using teslas supercharger network at the time it included only two stations on the east coast broder made a variety of critical claims about the batterys performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations the trip ended with the model s carried by a flatbed truck to the milford connecticut station423 tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicles charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broders account on several factual details424 tesla implied that broders behavior forced the car to fail broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels425 in the midst of the controversy a cnn reporter recreated broders trip without exhausting the battery however two key differences distinguished the two journeys the weather was about 10f 6c warmer and cnn did the trip in one day the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in426 a reporter from cnbc also recreated the trip in one day without incidents427 one week later a group of tesla owners recreated broders trip without problems one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates428429 on february 18 2013 new york times public editor margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took casual and imprecise notes of his test drive and did not use good judgment but she maintained that the article was done in good faith she also claimed that broders vehicle logs were sometimes quite misleading430431432 in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the tv german association for technical inspection and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the batterys performance according to the magazine tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test433434 a test performed by another german publication die welt supported the findings435 nhtsa safest caredit on august 19 2013 based on nhtsa safety ratings a tesla press release claimed that the model s had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested tesla stated nhtsa does not publish a star rating above 5 however safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall vehicle safety score vss provided to manufacturers where the model s achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars436437438439440 however a few days later nhtsa rebutted teslas claim explaining that the rating for the model s was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines441442443 power dissipation when not in useedit older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasnt being used with the batteries losing 4.5 kwh overnight known commonly as vampire drain444 system software v58 v14930 released december 12 2013 reduced overnight energy loss substantially to 1.1kwh per night or around 3 miles91 in january 2014 bjrn nyland a model s owner in norway recorded a range loss of approximately 20 during a 27-day extended vacation an indicated range loss of 63 miles 101km or 2.3 miles 3.7km per day while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached445 consumer reports recommendationedit in october 2015 two months after naming the tesla the best car ever tested consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a recommended designation citing too many complaints from owners complaints ranged from minor such as misaligned doors and squeaky body to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles teslas shares dropped 15 both because of the magazines cut and because of concerns over the tesla model x luxury suv30446 similarly edmundscom found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and amassed quite the repair rsum during the last 17 months447 both edmunds and consumer reports reported issues including the vehicle stalling while driving448 in their 2016 annual auto reliability survey consumer reports improved the model s rating to average reliability while reporting that the model x has had significant malfunction issues the magazine also raised serious concerns about how some automakers including tesla have designed deployed and marketed semi-autonomous technology31 power discrepancyedit the p85d insane was widely reported to have 691 horsepower449450 but some owners reported 20 less power on dynamometer in various circumstances451452 manufacturers are required by eu law to display power at full setting of the power controller from an external dc source when performing laboratory vehicle approval but not necessarily to show power limited by battery other equipment must be removed or their power added to the measurement453454 actual power available depends on circumstances453 as it does for piston cars455 which until 1972 could be 2530 less than given456457 as of november 2015update tesla website shows battery-limited combined 463hp for p85d 532hp for ludicrous458451 autonomy limitationsedit the autonomy features of the model s including autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control have limitations that have led to collisions when the driver becomes inattentive459 tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always must be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision460 as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles bicycles and pedestrians however critics such as scientist andrew ng have accused tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security461 electrical consumption of tesla model sedit in early march 2016 a report by stuff magazine revealed that test performed by vicom ltd on behalf of singapores land transport authority had found a 2014 tesla model s to be consuming 444whkm 0.715kwhmi,462463 which was greater than the 236whkm 0.38kwhmi reported by the us environmental protection agency epa464 and the 181whkm 0.291kwhmi reported by tesla465 as a result a carbon surcharge of s15000 us10900 was imposed on the model s making singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car466 the land transport authority justified this by stating that it had to account for co2 emissions during the electricity generation process and therefore a grid emission factor of 0.5gwatt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption467 however tesla motors countered that when the energy used to extract refine and distribute gasoline was taken into account the model s produces approximately one-third the co2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle465 later that month the land transport authority released a statement stating that they and the vicom emission test laboratory will be working with tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test468 and a tesla statement indicated that the discussions were positive and that they were confident of a quick resolution465 see alsoedit electric car use by country government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles list of electric cars currently available
