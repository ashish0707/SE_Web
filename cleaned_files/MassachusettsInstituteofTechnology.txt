rogers building back bay boston 19th century in 1859 a proposal was submitted to the massachusetts general court to use newly filled lands in back bay boston for a conservatory of art and science but the proposal failed1718 a charter for the incorporation of the massachusetts institute of technology proposed by william barton rogers was signed by the governor of massachusetts on april 10 1861.19 rogers a professor from the university of virginia wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances2021 he did not wish to found a professional school but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education22 proposing that the true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is as i conceive the teaching not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts which can be done only in the workshop but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them and along with this a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws23 the rogers plan reflected the german research university model emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories2425 early developmentsedit a 1905 map of mits boston campus two days after the charter was issued the first battle of the civil war broke out after a long delay through the war years mits first classes were held in the mercantile building in boston in 1865.26 the new institute was founded as part of the morrill land-grant colleges act to fund institutions to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes and was a land-grant school2728 in 1863 under the same act the commonwealth of massachusetts founded the massachusetts agricultural college which developed as the university of massachusetts amherst in 1866 the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the back bay29 mit was informally called boston tech29 the institute adopted the european polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date30 despite chronic financial problems the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under president francis amasa walker31 programs in electrical chemical marine and sanitary engineering were introduced3233 new buildings were built and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand31 the curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis with less focus on theoretical science34 the fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the mit leadership during these boston tech years mit faculty and alumni rebuffed harvard university president and former mit faculty charles w eliots repeated attempts to merge mit with harvard colleges lawrence scientific school35 there would be at least six attempts to absorb mit into harvard36 in its cramped back bay location mit could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding eventually the mit corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with harvard over the vehement objections of mit faculty students and alumni36 however a 1917 decision by the massachusetts supreme judicial court effectively put an end to the merger scheme36 plaque in building 6 honoring george eastman founder of eastman kodak who was revealed as the anonymous mr smith who helped maintain mits independence in 1916 the mit administration and the mit charter crossed the charles river on the ceremonial barge bucentaur built for the occasion3738 to signify mits move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a mile-long tract along the cambridge side of the charles river3940 the neoclassical new technology campus was designed by william w bosworth41 and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious mr smith starting in 1912 in january 1920 the donor was revealed to be the industrialist george eastman of rochester new york who had invented methods of film production and processing and founded eastman kodak between 1912 and 1920 eastman donated 20 million 236.6 million in 2015 dollars in cash and kodak stock to mit42 curricular reformsedit in the 1930s president karl taylor compton and vice-president effectively provost vannevar bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios43 the compton reforms renewed confidence in the ability of the institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering44 unlike ivy league schools mit catered more to middle-class families and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding45 the school was elected to the association of american universities in 1934.46 still as late as 1949 the lewis committee lamented in its report on the state of education at mit that the institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school a partly unjustified perception the committee sought to change the report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum recommended offering a broader education and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities4748 the school of humanities arts and social sciences and the mit sloan school of management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful schools of science and engineering previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics management political science and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs4950 the school of humanities arts and social sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents howard w johnson and jerome wiesner between 1966 and 1980.51 defense researchedit mits involvement in military research surged during world war ii in 1941 vannevar bush was appointed head of the federal office of scientific research and development and directed funding to only a select group of universities including mit52 engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at mits radiation laboratory established in 1940 to assist the british military in developing microwave radar the work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area53 other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight bombsight and inertial navigation under charles stark drapers instrumentation laboratory5455 the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under project whirlwind56 and high-speed and high-altitude photography under harold edgerton5758 by the end of the war mit became the nations largest wartime rd contractor attracting some criticism of bush52 employing nearly 4000 in the radiation laboratory alone53 and receiving in excess of 100 million 1.2 billion in 2015 dollars before 1946.44 work on defense projects continued even after then post-war government-sponsored research at mit included sage and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and project apollo59 a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science engineering and the arts we might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives mit president james rhyne killian 194960 these activities affected mit profoundly a 1949 report noted the lack of any great slackening in the pace of life at the institute to match the return to peacetime remembering the academic tranquility of the prewar years though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities61 the faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of karl taylor compton president of mit between 1930 and 1948 james rhyne killian president from 1948 to 1957 and julius adams stratton chancellor from 1952 to 1957 whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university by the 1950s mit no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons philanthropic foundations and the federal government62 in late 1960s and early 1970s student and faculty activists protested against the vietnam war and mits defense research6364 in this period mits various departments were researching helicopters smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles65 the union of concerned scientists was founded on march 4 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems66 mit ultimately divested itself from the instrumentation laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the lincoln laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests6768 the student body faculty and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities63 johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to greater strength and unity after these times of turmoil69 however six mit students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders such as michael albert and george katsiaficas are still indignant about mits role in military research and its suppression of these protests70 richard leacocks film november actions records some of these tumultuous events71 recent historyedit the mit media lab

mac the artificial intelligence laboratory and the tech model railroad club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like spacewar and created much of modern hacker slang and culture74 several major computer-related organizations have originated at mit since the 1980s richard stallmans gnu project and the subsequent free software foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the ai lab the mit media lab was founded in 1985 by nicholas negroponte and jerome wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology75 the world wide web consortium standards organization was founded at the laboratory for computer science in 1994 by tim berners-lee76 the opencourseware project has made course materials for over 2,000 mit classes available online free of charge since 200277 and the one laptop per child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.78 mit was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs7980 despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century mit launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus the tang center for management education several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology brain and cognitive sciences genomics biotechnology and cancer research and a number of new backlot buildings on vassar street including the stata center81 construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the media lab the sloan schools eastern campus and graduate residences in the northwest8283 in 2006 president hockfield launched the mit energy research council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption84 in 2001 inspired by the open source and open access movements85 mit launched opencourseware to make the lecture notes problem sets syllabuses exams and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed86 while the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high87 ocw expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the opencourseware consortium which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages88 in 2011 mit announced it would offer formal certification but not credits or degrees to online participants completing coursework in its mitx program for a modest fee89 the edx online platform supporting mitx was initially developed in partnership with harvard and its analogous harvardx initiative the courseware platform is open source and other universities have already joined and added their own course content90 three days after the boston marathon bombing of april 2013 mit police patrol officer sean collier was fatally shot by the suspects dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the boston metropolitan area for a day91 one week later colliers memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people in a ceremony hosted by the mit community with thousands of police officers from the new england region and canada929394 on november 25 2013 mit announced the creation of the collier medal to be awarded annually to an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that officer collier exhibited as a member of the mit community and in all aspects of his life the announcement further stated that future recipients of the award will include those

institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency mit has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles subsidizing public transportation passes and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity heating and cooling requirements117 the mit police with state and local authorities in the 2009-2011 period have investigated reports of 12 forcible sex offenses 6 robberies 3 aggravated assaults 164 burglaries 1 case of arson and 4 cases of motor vehicle theft on

curriculum arguing that education at mit was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education the successful student according to snyder was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms for example organized student groups had compiled course biblescollections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references this sort of gamesmanship snyder argued hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest185186 robert engmans mbius strip hanging from the crown of the barker engineering librarys reading
