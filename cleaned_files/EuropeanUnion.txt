inhabitants and growing projected to be 90 in seven member states by 2020 living in urban areas cities are largely spread out across the eu although with a large grouping in and around the benelux an increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas in some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of eu funds into a region55 member

institutions a practice often referred to as pooling of sovereignty5657 to become a member a country must meet the copenhagen criteria defined at the 1993 meeting of the european council in copenhagen these require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law a functioning market economy and the acceptance of the obligations of membership including eu law evaluation of a countrys fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the european council58 no member state has yet left the union although greenland an autonomous province of denmark withdrew in 1985.59 the

change programme viru bog in lahemaa national park in estonia a protected habitat under the habitats directive in 1957 when the eec was founded it had no environmental policy67 over the past 50 years an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created extending to all areas of environmental protection including air pollution water quality waste management nature conservation and the control of chemicals industrial hazards and biotechnology68 according to the institute for european environmental policy environmental law comprises over 500 directives regulations and decisions making environmental policy a core area of european politics69 european policy-makers originally increased the eus capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem70 trade barriers and competitive distortions in the common market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state71 in subsequent years the environment became a formal policy area with its own policy actors principles and procedures the legal basis for eu environmental policy was established with the introduction of the single european act in 1987.69 a black stork a protected species under regulation ec no 33897 initially eu environmental policy focused on europe more recently the eu has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance eg the role of the eu in securing the ratification and coming into force of the kyoto protocol despite opposition from the united states this international dimension is reflected in the eus sixth environmental action programme72 which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at eu level and worldwide the lisbon treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions73 eu law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in europe as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management69 mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of eu environmental policy in 2007 member states agreed that in future 20 of the energy used across the eu must be renewable and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 compared to 1990 levels74 the eu has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy75 the european green capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment energy efficiency and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city politics main article politics of the european union the european union operates according to the principles of conferral which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties and of subsidiarity which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone laws made by the eu institutions are passed in a variety of forms generally speaking they can be classified into two groups those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures regulations and those which specifically require national implementation measures directives76 constitutional nature further information treaties of the european union political system of the european union the classification of the eu in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated it began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states however since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation such as the direct effect of the law of the general level of government upon the individual77 and majority voting in the decision-making process of the general level of government78 without becoming a federation per se scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation being an instance of neither political structure79 for this reason the organisation is termed sui generis incomparable one of a kind80 although some argue that this designation is no longer valid8182 the organisation has traditionally used the terms community and later union to describe itself the difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations and international law where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations they can also be seen in the light of differing european and american constitutional traditions81 especially in terms of the european tradition the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law so the eu cannot be called a federation at least not without qualification it is however described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state83 the german constitutional court refers to the eu as a staatenverbund an intermediate structure between the staatenbund confederation of states and the bundesstaat federal state consistent with this concept84 this may be a long-lived political form professor andrew moravcsik claims that the eu is unlikely to develop further into a federal state but instead has reached maturity as a constitutional system85 governance main articles institutions of the european union and legislature of the european union the european union has seven institutions the european council the council of the european union the european parliament the european commission the court of justice of the european union the european

eurozone is determined by the european central bank the interpretation and the application of eu law and the treaties are ensured by the court of justice of the european union the eu budget is

the european council are ensuring the external representation of the eu89 driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states both during meetings of the european council and over the periods between them the european council should not be mistaken for the council of europe an international organisation independent of the eu based in strasbourg council of the european union the council of the european union also called the council90 and the council of ministers its former title91 forms one half of the eus legislature it consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed notwithstanding its different configurations it is considered to be one single body92 in addition to its legislative functions the council also exercises executive functions in relations to the common foreign and security policy european parliament the hemicycle of the european parliament in strasbourg the european parliament forms the other half of the eus legislature the 751 members of the european parliament meps are directly elected by eu citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation although meps are elected on a national basis they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system93 the european parliament and the council of the european union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure this also applies to the eu budget the european commission is accountable to parliament requiring its approval to take office having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it the president of the european parliament currently martin schulz carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally the

responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the eu the commission is also seen as the motor of european integration it operates as a cabinet government with 28 commissioners for different areas of policy one from each member state though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the eu as a whole rather than their home state one of the 28 is the president of the european commission currently jean-claude juncker appointed by the european council after the president the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who is ex-officio a vice-president of the commission and is also chosen by the european council95 the other 26 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the council of the european union in agreement with the nominated president the 28 commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the european parliament budget main article budget of the european union the 2011 eu budget 141.9 bn96 cohesion and competitiveness for growth and employment 45 direct aids and market related expenditures 31 rural development 11 eu as a global partner 6 administration 6 citizenship freedom security and justice 1 the eu had an agreed budget of 120.7billion for the year 2007 and 864.3billion for the period 20072013,97 representing 1.10 and 1.05 of the eu-27s gni forecast for the respective periods by comparison the united kingdoms expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be 759billion and france was estimated to have spent 801billion in 1960 the budget of the then european economic community was 0.03 of gdp98 in the 2010 budget of 141.5billion the largest single expenditure item is cohesion competitiveness with around 45 of the total budget99 next comes agriculture with approximately 31 of the total99 rural development environment and fisheries takes up around 11.99 administration accounts for around 6.99 the eu as a global partner and citizenship freedom security and justice bring up the rear with approximately 6 and 1 respectively99 the court of auditors is legally obliged to provide the parliament and the council with a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions100 the court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions101 the parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commissions handling of the budget the european court of auditors has signed off the european union accounts every year since 2007 and while making it clear that the european commission has more work to do has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level102103 in their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of union expenditure agriculture and the cohesion fund were materially affected by error104 the european commission estimated in 2009 that the financial effect of irregularities was 1,863million.105 competences eu member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the european union in some areas the eu enjoys exclusive competence these are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation in other areas the eu and its member states share the competence to legislate while both can legislate member states can only legislate to the extent to which the eu has not in other policy areas the eu can only co-ordinate support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws106 that a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence and even with the same policy area the distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided in the following three categories as outlined in title i of part i of the consolidated treaty on the functioning of the european union view talk edit exclusive competence shared competence supporting competence the union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a union legislative act the customs union the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market monetary policy for the member states whose currency is the euro the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy common commercial policy conclusion of certain international agreements member states cannot exercise competence in areas where the union has done so the internal market social policy for the aspects defined in this treaty economic social and territorial cohesion agriculture and fisheries excluding the conservation of marine biological resources environment consumer protection transport trans-european networks energy the area of freedom security and justice common safety concerns in public health matters for the aspects defined in this treaty union exercise of competence shall not result in member states being prevented from exercising theirs in research technological development andouter space development cooperation humanitarian aid the union coordinates member states policies or implements supplemental to theirs common policies not covered elsewhere coordination of economic employment and social policies common foreign security and defence policies the union can carry out actions to support coordinate or supplement member states actions in the protection and improvement of human health industry culture tourism education youth sport and vocational training civil protection disaster prevention administrative cooperation legal system further information european union law treaties of the european union and charter of fundamental rights of the european union the court of justice seated in luxembourg the eu is based on a series of treaties these first established the european community and the eu and then made amendments to those founding treaties107 these are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals these legal powers include the ability to enact legislatione which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitantsf the eu has legal personality with the right to sign agreements and international treaties108 under the principle of supremacy national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified and thus the laws enacted under them even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law and within limits even constitutional provisionsg courts of justice the judicial branch of the euformally called the court of justice of the european unionconsists of three courts the court of justice the general court and the european union civil service tribunal together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the eu109 the court of justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states the institutions and cases referred to it by the courts of member states110 the general court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the eus courts111 and the european union civil service tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the european union and its civil service112 decisions from the general court can be appealed to the court of justice but only on a point of law113 fundamental rights the ceremony of the 1990 sakharov prize awarded to aung san suu kyi by martin schulz inside the parliaments strasbourg hemicycle in 2013 the treaties declare that the eu itself is founded on the values of respect for human dignity freedom democracy equality the rule of law and respect for human rights including the rights of persons belonging to minorities in a society in which pluralism non-discrimination tolerance justice solidarity and equality between women and men prevail114 in 2009 the lisbon treaty gave legal effect to the charter of fundamental rights of the european union the charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the eus legal acts can be judged it consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the court of justice and derived from the constitutional traditions common to the member states115 the court of justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has on occasion invalidated eu legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights116 although signing the european convention on human rights echr is a condition for eu membershiph previously the eu itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a statei nor had the competence to accedej the lisbon treaty and protocol 14 to the echr have changed this the former binds the eu to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it although the eu is independent from council of europe they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law human rights and democracy further european convention on human rights and european social charter the source of law of charter of fundamental rights are created by council of europe the eu also promoted human rights issues in the wider world the eu opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition abolition of the death penalty is a condition for eu membership117 acts the main legal acts of the eu come in three forms regulations directives and decisions regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force without the requirement for any implementing measuresk and automatically override conflicting domestic provisionse directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result the details of how they are to be implemented are left to member statesl when the time limit for implementing directives passes they may under certain conditions have direct effect in national law against member states decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation they are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals companies or a particular member state they are most often used in competition law or on rulings on state aid but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions regulations directives and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy118 area of freedom security and justice further information area of freedom security and justice the borders inside the schengen area between germany and austria since the creation of the eu in 1993 it has developed its competencies in the area of freedom security and justice initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism to this end agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions europol for co-operation of police forces119 eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors120 and frontex for co-operation between border control authorities121 the eu also operates the schengen information system17 which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities this co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the schengen agreement and the associated cross border crime furthermore the union has legislated in areas such as extradition122 family law123 asylum law124 and criminal justice125 prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treatiesm in more recent years these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race religion disability age and sexual orientationn by virtue of these powers the eu has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place age discrimination and racial discriminationo foreign relations main articles foreign relations of the european union common foreign and security policy and european external action service the eu participates in all g8 and g20 summits g20 summit in seoul foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957 when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy126 steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of european political cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies it was not however until 1987 when european political cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the single european act epc was renamed as the common foreign and security policy cfsp by the maastricht treaty127 high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy federica mogherini the aims of the cfsp are to promote both the eus own interests and those of the international community as a whole including the furtherance of international co-operation respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law128 the cfsp requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue the unanimity and difficult issues treated under the cfsp sometimes lead to disagreements such as those which occurred over the war in iraq129 the coordinator and representative of the cfsp within the eu is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the eu in foreign policy and defence matters and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment the high representative heads up the european external action service eeas a unique eu department130 that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 december 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon131 the eeas will serve as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the european union132 besides the emerging international policy of the european union the international influence of the eu is also felt through enlargement the perceived benefits of becoming a member of the eu act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the eus accession criteria and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of european formerly communist countries133762 this influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as soft power as opposed to military hard power134 military main article military of the european union seat of frontex in warsaw the predecessors of the european union were not devised as a military alliance because nato was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes135 22 eu members are members of nato136 while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality137 the western european union a military alliance with a mutual defence clause was disbanded in 2010 as its role had been transferred to the eu138 an a400m military transport aircraft built by airbus group se societas europaea latin european company according to the stockholm international peace research institute sipri the united kingdom spent 61 billion on defence in 2014 placing it fifth in the world while france spent 53 billion the sixth largest139 together the uk and france account for approximately 40 per cent of eus defence budget and 50 per cent of its military capacity140 both are officially recognised nuclear weapon states holding permanent seats on the united nations security council following the kosovo war in 1999 the european council agreed that the union must have the capacity for autonomous action backed by credible military forces the means to decide to use them and the readiness to do so in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by nato to that end a number of efforts were made to increase the eus military capability notably the helsinki headline goal process after much discussion the most concrete result was the eu battlegroups initiative each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500personnel.141 eu forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern africa to the western balkans and western asia142 eu military operations are supported by a number of bodies including the european defence agency european union satellite centre and the european union military staff143 frontex is an agency of the eu established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders it aims to detect and stop illegal immigration human trafficking and terrorist infiltration in 2015 the european commission presented its proposal for a new european border and coast guard agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management in an eu consisting of 28 members substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states144 humanitarian aid further information echo european commission collectively the eu is the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world145146 the european commissions humanitarian aid and civil protection department or echo provides humanitarian aid from the eu to developing countries in 2012 its budget amounted to 874 million 51 of the budget went to africa and 20 to asia latin america the caribbean and pacific and 20 to the middle east and mediterranean147 humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget 70 as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the european development fund 30.148 the eus external action financing is divided into geographic instruments and thematic instruments148 the geographic instruments provide aid through the development cooperation instrument dci 16.9 billion 20072013 which must spend 95 of its budget on overseas development assistance oda and from the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument enpi which contains some relevant programmes148 the european development fund edf 22.7 bn 20082013 is made up of voluntary contributions by member states but there is pressure to merge the edf into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7 target and allow the european parliament greater oversight148 however five countries have reached the 0.7 target sweden luxembourg the netherlands denmark and the united kingdom149150 in 2011 eu aid was 0.42 of the

national arms and the words european union given in their official languages irish model two of the original core objectives of the european economic community were the development of a common market subsequently becoming a single market and a customs union between its member states the single market involves the free circulation of goods capital people and services within the eu154 and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties discriminatory taxes or import quotas as they travel internally the non-eu member states of iceland norway liechtenstein and switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union63 half the trade in the eu is covered by legislation harmonised by the eu164 free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries165 until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow post-maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ecj judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom the free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states the free movement of persons means that eu citizens can move freely between member states to live work study or retire in another country this required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states166 the free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis while services account for 6070 of gdp legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas this lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services167 according to the treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised monetary union main articles eurozone and economic and monetary union of the european union the seat of the european central bank in frankfurt 19 of the 28 eu member states have adopted the euro as their legal tender the creation of a european single currency became an official objective of the european economic community in 1969 in 1992 having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union the member states signed the maastricht treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union the states wanting to participate had first to join the european exchange rate mechanism in 1999 the currency union started first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining in 2002 the currency was fully put into place when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone which by then consisted of 12 member states the eurozone constituted by the eu member states which have adopted the euro has since grown to 19 countries168p the eurozone blue represents 340 million people the euro is the second-largest reserve currency in the world since its launch the euro has become the second reserve currency in the world with a quarter of foreign exchanges reserves being in euro169 the euro and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the eu are under the control of the european central bank ecb170 the ecb is the central bank for the eurozone and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability it is at the centre of the european system of central banks which comprehends all eu national central banks and is controlled by its general council consisting of the president of the ecb who is appointed by the european council the vice-president of the ecb and the governors of the national central banks of all 28 eu member states171 the european system of financial supervision is an institutional architecture of the eus framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities the european banking authority the european insurance and occupational pensions authority and the european securities and markets authority to complement this framework there is also a european systemic risk board under the responsibility of the ecb the aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the eu172 to prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union they were obliged in the maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level energy main article energy policy of the european union consumed energy 2012173 energy source origin percents oil imported 33 domestic 6 gas imported 14

energy produced in the eu regardless of the source of the uranium of which less than 3 is produced in the eu175 the eu has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence this has its roots in the original european coal and steel community the introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive european energy policy was approved at the meeting of the european council in october 2005 and the first draft policy was published in january 2007.176 the eu has five key points in its energy policy increase competition in the internal market encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in central asia177 and north africa use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation and finally increase funding for new energy technologies176 the eu imports 82 of its oil 57 of its natural gas178 and 97.48 of its uranium175 demands because of europes dependence on russian energy the eu is attempting to diversify its energy supply179 infrastructure further information european commissioner for transport european commissioner for industry and entrepreneurship and european investment bank the resund bridge

traffic management system ertms an initiative to greatly enhance safety increase efficiency of trains and enhance cross-border interoperability of rail transport in europe by replacing signalling equipment with digitised mostly wireless versions and by creating a single europe-wide standard for train control and command systems the developing european transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network in the pre-2004 eu members the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution after the recent enlargement the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda182 the polish road network was upgraded such as the a4 autostrada183184 the galileo positioning system is another eu infrastructure project galileo is a proposed satellite navigation system to be built by the eu and launched by the european space agency esa the galileo project was launched partly to reduce the eus dependency on the us-operated global positioning system but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy given the aged nature of the gps system185 agriculture main article common agricultural policy vineyards in romania eu farms are supported by the common agricultural policy the largest budgetary expenditure the common agricultural policy cap is one of the long lasting policies of the european community186 the policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production providing certainty in food supplies ensuring a high quality of life for farmers stabilising markets and ensuring reasonable prices for consumersr it was until recently operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention until the 1990s the policy accounted for over 60 of the then european communitys annual budget and as of 2013update accounts for around 34.187 the policys price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction these were intervention stores of products bought up by the community to maintain minimum price levels to dispose of surplus stores they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below community guaranteed prices or farmers were offered subsidies amounting to the difference between the community and world prices to export their products outside the community this system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside europe especially those in the developing world188 supporters of cap argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living188 since the beginning of the 1990s the cap has been subject to a series of reforms initially these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988 where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production milk quotas and more recently the de-coupling or disassociation of the money farmers receive from the eu and the amount they produce by the fischler reforms in 2004 agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce toward direct payments based on farm size this is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels186 one of these reforms entailed the abolition of the eus sugar regime which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain african-caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the eu189 competition further information european union competition law and european commissioner for competition the eu operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single markets the commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues approving mergers breaking up cartels working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid190 the competition commissioner currently margrethe vestager is one of the most powerful positions in the commission notable for the ability to affect the commercial interests of trans-national corporations191 for example in 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the united states ge and honeywell which had already been approved by their national authority192 another high-profile case against microsoft resulted in the commission fining microsoft over 777million following

warsaw hosted the uefa euro 2012 sport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations rather than of the eu however there are some eu policies that have affected sport such as the free movement of workers which was at the core of the bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with european citizenship233 the treaty of lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity234 this followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the international olympic committee and fifa due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport which led to an increasing gap
