receiving 91.6 percent of the vote10 during his early years as chairman gabriel pushed through internal party reforms he abolished the party steering committee in favor of an expanded executive

its 100,000 yearly membership fee to the socialist international in january 2012 gabriel had been critical of the socialist internationals admittance and continuing inclusion of undemocratic despotic political movements into the organization1213 for the 2013 federal election gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel but deemed too unpopular and undisciplined at the time14 as a consequence he and the other members of the partys leadership agreed to nominate peer steinbrck after frank-walter steinmeier the partys parliamentary leader withdrew from the contest15 during the election campaign gabriel became the first spd leader to address a party convention of alliance 90the greens in his speech he called for a redgreen alliance to defeat

christian schmidt and ursula von der leyen 2014 in 2013 gabriel turned the social democrats third successive defeat to angela merkel in the federal election into a share of government after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members who endorsed the accord17 at the time he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully particularly considering the relative weakness of his party which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections against more than 41 percent for merkels conservative bloc18 at an spd convention shortly after the elections however gabriel and the other members of the partys leadership were punished by delegates who re-elected them to their posts with reduced majorities he received 83.6 percent of members ballots after 91.6 percent at the previous vote in 2011.19 gabriel who serves as vice-chancellor in the third merkel cabinet took on responsibility for germanys energy overhaul as part of a newly configured economy ministry17 together with his french counterpart emmanuel macron he presented a joint proposal in 2015 to set up a common eurozone budget20 speculation about gabriels future as leader of the spd has been brewing since he registered just 74 percent21 in a party delegates vote of confidence in december 2015 the lowest for an spd leader in 20 years22 still he is widely seen as running in the 2017 federal elections given the lack of clear rivals and apparent reluctance among top spd officials to take on what is viewed as an unenviable position23 in may 2016 gabriel invited others to put themselves forward so that party members can choose their candidate24 political positionsedit foreign policyedit gabriel meets iranian president hassan rouhani 16 july 2015 gabriel has been staunchly against german soldiers remaining in afghanistan in 2010 he called for an independent assessment that would determine whether the us counter-insurgency strategy

august 2014 that a federal structure was the only option to resolve pro-russian unrest in the country he added that germanys priority was to prevent direct conflict between russia and its southern neighbour28 commenting on the international sanctions regime against russia gabriel stated in early 2015 that we want to help resolve the conflict in ukraine but dont want to force russia to its knees29 he later suggested that europe consider easing sanctions in exchange for cooperation in syria30 ukrainian-american historian alexander j motyl has accused gabriel of appeasement and a complete betrayal of everything democratic socialists claim to stand for31 in july 2015 gabriel became the first top level german government visitor to iran in 13 years32 as well as the first senior figure from any large western countrys government to visit the country since it struck a landmark agreement on its nuclear program the joint comprehensive plan of action only days earlier33 travelling with a delegation of german industry representatives keen to move back into the iranian market he met with president hassan rouhani foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and oil minister bijan namdar zangeneh32 the trip irritated israel as well as the jewish community the israeli ambassador privately voiced his concerns about gabriels visit to the german government and the world jewish congress sharply criticized the minister accusing him of putting business interests before morals and calling his approach to tehran naive34 in september 2015 amid the european migrant crisis gabriel visited the zaatari refugee camp in jordan to learn more about the plight of syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing syrian civil war that erupted in 2011.35 gabriel publicly urged saudi arabia to stop supporting religious radicals amid growing concern among about the countrys funding of wahhabi mosques in germany which are accused of breeding dangerous islamists36 economic policyedit on the occasion of the g20 summit in 2011 gabriel joined ed miliband the leader of the uks labour party and hkan juholt the chairman of the swedish social democratic party in suggesting a new deal for economic growth they also said g20 leaders should commit to the introduction of a financial transaction tax for all major financial centers and an agreement to separate consumer and investment banking37 in a letter to the european commissioner for trade karel de gucht gabriel stated in march 2014 that special investment-protection provisions are not required in an agreement between the eu and the us on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip38 instead he later called for a public trade and investment court to replace the current system of private arbitration and to enable appeals against arbitration rulings39 meanwhile he has continuously warned against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from ttip but maintained that the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers40 by august 2016 gabriel said talks on ttip had de facto failed41 in september 2014 gabriel rejected the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement clause in the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta between canada and the european union prompting a renegotiation that delayed the entry into force of the agreement42 following the renegotiations he championed ceta to demonstrate the center-left partys business credentials43 in a 2014 meeting with french economist thomas piketty whose best-selling work capital in the twenty-first century calls for a wealth tax gabriel rejected such a progressive levy on capital as crazy for business he also argued that a wealth tax would generate no more than 8 billion euros 9.9 billion a year44 energy policyedit following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 gabriel harshly criticized the international atomic energy agency saying it had promoted the construction of nuclear plants in all parts of the world even in war and crisis regions that needs to stop45 in 2015 gabriel opposed a european commission proposal for regional power-capacity markets according to which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by renewable sources such as the sun and wind cannot supply the grid a free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets gabriel told handelsblatt46 he later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022.47 arms exportsedit early in his tenure as federal minister of economic affairs and energy gabriel vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports unnerving the sizeable defense industry and signaling a change in policy from the previous coalition government under which sales rose48 in august 2014 he withdrew permission for rheinmetall to build a military training center east of moscow49 gabriel is bound by pledges to his spd to reduce arms sales to states that abuse human rights and the rule of law or where such sales may contribute to political instability he has stated that controls over the final destination of small arms sold to such nations are still insufficient50 however he also indicated that the government would not universally block deals with countries outside of germanys traditional alliances deals with such countries could be approved because of special foreign-policy or security interests51 he suggested that in future the federal foreign office may be a more appropriate body for deciding whether to allow exports and called for common european arms exports52 in late 2015 his ministry approved a merger of german tank maker krauss-maffei wegmann kmw with the french armoured vehicle maker nexter53 digital policyedit in may 2014 gabriel and frances economy and digital minister arnaud montebourg sent the european commissioner for competition joaqun almunia a letter criticizing the settlement of a three-year antitrust probe into google54 gabriel later warmly

2015 gabriel and his french counterpart emmanuel macron wrote in a joint letter to vice-president of the european commission andrus ansip that the growing power of some online giants warrants a policy consultation with the aim of establishing an appropriate general regulatory framework for essential digital platforms57 in 2016 during a series of chinese bids for german engineering firms gabriel publicly called for a european-wide safeguard clause which could stop foreign takeovers of firms whose technology is deemed strategic for the future economic success of the region58 human rightsedit in april 2014 human rights lawyer mo shaoping was blocked from meeting gabriel during his visit to china despite the minister saying ahead of the meeting that he wanted to meet critical voices59 during a 2015 visit to king salman of saudi arabia gabriel launched an unusual public effort to persuade saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer raif badawi and grant him clemency amplifying germanys political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past60 he had been urged by mps and human rights organizations to take up badawis case before his trip61 his outspoken criticism of saudi justice was unusual for western leaders visiting the country a close ally for the west in fighting terrorism and islamic state militants particularly given germanys status as saudi arabias third-largest source of imports60 while the us state department had previously also criticized the badawi sentence us secretary of state john kerry did not talk about the case publicly when he visited riyadh only days before60 during a subsequent trip to qatar gabriel called on the emir of qatar sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani and other senior officials to do better in protecting foreign household workers who face abuse from their employers62 controversyedit thilo sarrazinedit in 2010 gabriel called the speeches of thilo sarrazin his party colleague who wrote critically about immigration by accusing muslims of refusing to integrate and of dumbing down german society63 verbal violence he stated that although sarrazin described many things that were accurate his conclusions did not fit into the egalitarian ideals of social democracy anymore63 kaisers takeoveredit in 2016 a german court nullified gabriels controversial decision to grant a special permission for the countrys biggest supermarket chain edeka to buy grocery store chain kaisers owned by tengelmann group the judges raised questions about the ministers bias and a lack of neutrality
