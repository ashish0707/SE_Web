the ffestiniog pumped storage dam in wales uk is an early example of a major energy storage facility built in 1963 the 150 mw andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant located in spain the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store captured solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity when the sun isnt shining1 this is a list of energy storage projects worldwide many individual energy storage projects augment electrical grids by capturing excess electrical energy during periods of low demand and storing it in other forms until needed on an electrical grid the energy is later converted back to its electrical form and returned to the grid as needed another energy storage method is the consumption of surplus or low-cost energy typically during night time for conversion into resources such as hot water cool water or ice which is then used for heating or cooling at other times when electricity is in higher demand and at greater cost per kilowatt hour kwh such thermal energy storage is often employed at end-user sites such as large buildings and also as part of district heating thus shifting energy consumption to other times for better balancing of supply and demand some notable energy storage projects include sir adam beck hydroelectric generating stations bear swamp hydroelectric power station seneca pumped
