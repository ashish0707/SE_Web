venus project10 critical appraisals its a lack of professional engagement william gazecki who in 2006 completed future by design a feature-length profile of jacque fresco says that has hurt fresco the most the real missing link in jacques world is having put jacque to work gazecki says its exemplified when people say well show me some buildings hes built and i dont mean the domes out in venus i mean lets see an office building lets see a manufacturing plant lets see a circular city and thats where he should have been 30 years ago he should have been applying his work in the real world but hes not a collaborator and i think thats why hes never had great public achievements58 fresco on fresco when asked by a reporter why he has such difficulty actualizing his many ideas fresco responded because i cant get to anybody59 views on fresco frescos critical view of modern economics has been compared to thorstein veblens concept of the predatory phase in human development according to an article in the journal of society and business review6061 grnborg has labeled other facets of frescos ideology a tabula rasa approach62 synergetics theorist arthur coulter calls frescos city designs organic and evolutionary rather than revolutionary63 coulter posits such cities as the answer to walter b cannons idea of achieving homeostasis for society63 hypothetical form of government fresco describes his form of governance in this way the aims of the venus project have no parallel in history not with communism socialism fascism or any other political ideology this is true because cybernation is of recent origin with this system the system of financial influence and control will no longer exist62 ludwig von mises institute scholar robert p murphy has raised the calculation problem against a resource-based economy64 in a resource-based economy murphy claims there is no ability to calculate the availability and desirability of resources because the price mechanism is not utilized addressing this aspect another article in the quarterly journal of austrian economics states criticism of central plannings computation problem applies to the ideas of fresco65 question of utopianism the venus project states on its website states that it is not utopian66 nikolina olsen-rule writing for the copenhagen institute for futures studies supports this idea for most people the promise of the project sounds like an unattainable utopia but if you examine it more closely there are surprisingly many scientifically founded arguments that open up an entire new world of possibilities67 morten grnborg also of copenhagen institute for futures studies points out the venus project is  this visionary idea of a future society has many characteristics in common with the utopia  the word utopia carries a double meaning since in greek it can mean both the good place eutopia and the nonexisting place outopia a good place is precisely what fresco has devoted his life to describing and fighting for68 comments on fresco hans-ulrich obrist notes frescos future may of course seem outmoded and his writings have been subject to critique for their fascistic undertones of order and similitude but his contributions are etched in the popular psyche and his eco-friendly concepts continue to influence our present generation of progressive architects city planners and designers69 frescos work gained the attention of science fiction enthusiast and critic forrest j ackerman11 fresco would later attract star trek animator doug drexler who worked with fresco to produce several computer renderings of his designs70 commenting on fresco physicist paul g hewitt wrote that fresco inspired him toward a career in physical science3471 awards in july 2016 jacque fresco
