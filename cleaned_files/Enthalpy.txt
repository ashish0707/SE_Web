inlpi symbol h is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system it is the thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system it is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume1 more technically it includes the internal energy which is the energy required to create a system and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure2 enthalpy is defined as a state function that depends only on the prevailing equilibrium state identified by the variables internal energy pressure and volume it is an extensive quantity the unit of measurement for enthalpy in the international system of units si is the joule but other historical conventional units are still in use such as the british thermal unit and the calorie the enthalpy is the preferred expression of system energy changes in many chemical biological and physical measurements at constant pressure because it simplifies the description of energy transfer at constant pressure the enthalpy change equals the energy transferred from the environment through heating or work other than expansion work the total enthalpy h of a system cannot be measured directly the same situation exists in classical mechanics only a change or difference in energy carries physical meaning enthalpy itself is a thermodynamic potential so in order to measure the enthalpy of a system we must refer to a defined reference point therefore what we measure is the change in enthalpy h the h is a positive change in endothermic reactions and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processes for processes under constant pressure h is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings3 this means that the change in enthalpy under such conditions is the heat absorbed or released by the material through a chemical reaction or by external heat transfer enthalpies for chemical substances at constant pressure assume standard state most commonly 1 bar pressure standard state does not strictly speaking specify a temperature see standard state but expressions for enthalpy generally reference the standard heat of formation at 25c enthalpy of ideal gases and incompressible solids and liquids does not depend on pressure unlike entropy and gibbs energy real materials at common temperatures and pressures usually closely approximate this behavior which greatly simplifies enthalpy calculation and use in practical designs and

ancient greek verb enthalpein  which means to warm in4 it combines the classical greek prefix - en- meaning to put into and the verb thalpein meaning to heat the word enthalpy is often incorrectly attributed to benot paul mile clapeyron 1799-1864 and rudolf clausius through the 1850 publication of their clausiusclapeyron relation this misconception was popularized by the 1927 publication of the mollier steam tables and diagrams however neither the concept the word nor the symbol for enthalpy existed until well after clapeyrons death the earliest writings to contain the concept of enthalpy did not appear until 1875,5 when josiah willard gibbs introduced a heat function for constant pressure however gibbs did not use the word enthalpy in his writingsnote 1 the actual word first appears in the scientific literature in a 1909 publication by j p dalton according to that publication heike kamerlingh onnes 18531926 actually coined the word6 over the years scientists used many different symbols to denote enthalpy in 1922 alfred w porter proposed the symbol h as a standard7 thus finalizing the terminology still in use today formal definitionedit the enthalpy of a homogeneous system is defined as89 h u p v  displaystyle hupv where h is the enthalpy of the system u is the internal energy of the system p is the pressure of the system v is the volume of the system the enthalpy is an extensive property this means that for homogeneous systems the enthalpy is proportional to the size of the system it is convenient to introduce the specific enthalpy hhm where m is the mass of the system or the molar enthalpy hmhn where n is the number of moles h and hm are intensive properties for inhomogeneous systems the enthalpy is the sum of the enthalpies of the composing subsystems h k h k  displaystyle hsum _kh_k where the label k refers to the various subsystems in case of continuously varying p t andor composition the summation becomes an integral h h d v  displaystyle hint rho hdv where is the density the enthalpy of homogeneous systems can be viewed as function hsp of the entropy s and the pressure p and a differential relation for it can be derived as follows we start from the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems for an infinitesimal process d u q w  displaystyle dudelta q-delta w here q is a small amount of heat added to the system and w a small amount of work performed by the system in a homogeneous system only reversible processes can take place so the second law of thermodynamics gives q tds with t the absolute temperature of the system furthermore if only pv work is done w pdv as a result d u t d s p d v  displaystyle dutds-pdv adding dpv to both sides of this expression gives d u d p v t d s p d v d p v  displaystyle dudpvtds-pdvdpv or d u p v t d s v d p  displaystyle dupvtdsvdp so d h s  p t d s v d p  displaystyle dhsptdsvdp other expressionsedit the above expression of dh in terms of entropy and pressure may be unfamiliar to some readers however there are expressions in terms of more familiar variables such as temperature and pressure88810 d h c p d t v 1 t d p  displaystyle dhc_pdtv1-alpha tdp here cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure and is the coefficient of cubic thermal expansion 1 v v t p  displaystyle alpha frac 1vleftfrac partial vpartial tright_p with this expression one can in principle determine the enthalpy if cp and v are known as functions of p and t note that for an ideal gas t1note 2 so that d h c p d t  displaystyle dhc_pdt in a more general form the first law describes the internal energy with additional terms involving the chemical potential and the number of particles of various types the differential statement for dh then becomes d h t d s v d p i i d n i  displaystyle dhtdsvdpsum _imu _idn_i where i is the chemical potential per particle for an i-type particle and ni is the number of such particles the last term can also be written as idni with dni the number of moles of component i added to the system and in this case i the molar chemical potential or as idmi with dmi the mass of component i added to the system and in this case i the specific chemical potential physical interpretationedit the u term can be interpreted as the energy required to create the system and the pv term as the energy that would be required to make room for the system if the pressure of the environment remained constant when a system for example n moles of a gas of volume v at pressure p and temperature t is created or brought to its present state from absolute zero energy must be supplied equal to its internal energy u plus pv where pv is the work done in pushing against the ambient atmospheric pressure in basic physics and statistical mechanics it may be more interesting to study the internal properties of the system and therefore the internal energy is used1112 in basic chemistry experiments are often conducted at constant atmospheric pressure and the pressure-volume work represents an energy exchange with the atmosphere that cannot be accessed or controlled so that h is the expression chosen for the heat of reaction for a heat engine a change in its internal energy is the difference between the heat input and the pressure-volume work done by the working substance while a change in its enthalpy is the difference between the heat input and the work done by the engine13 d h q w displaystyle dhdelta q-delta w where the work w done by the engine is w v d p displaystyle w-oint vdp relationship to heatedit in order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply we return to the first law for closed systems du q w we apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface in this case the work term can be split into two contributions the so-called pv work given by pdv where here p is the pressure at the surface dv is the increase of the volume of the system and all other types of work w such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction so we write w pdv w in this case the first law reads d u q p d v w  displaystyle dudelta q-pdv-delta w or d h q v d p w  displaystyle dhdelta qvdp-delta w from this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat d h q  displaystyle dhdelta q provided that the system is under constant pressure dp0 and that the only work done by the system is expansion work w014 applicationsedit in thermodynamics one can calculate enthalpy by determining the requirements for creating a system from nothingness the mechanical work required pv differs based upon the conditions that obtain during the creation of the thermodynamic system energy must be supplied to remove particles from the surroundings to make space for the creation of the system assuming that the pressure p remains constant this is the pv term the supplied energy must also provide the change in internal energy u which includes activation energies ionization energies mixing energies vaporization energies chemical bond energies and so forth together these constitute the change in the enthalpy upv for systems at constant pressure with no external work done other than the pv work the change in enthalpy is the heat received by the system for a simple system with a constant number of particles the difference in enthalpy is the maximum amount of thermal energy derivable from a thermodynamic process in which the pressure is held constantthis quote needs a citation heat of reactionedit main article standard enthalpy of reaction the total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly the enthalpy change of a system is measured instead enthalpy change is defined by the following equation h h f h i  displaystyle delta hh_mathrm f -h_mathrm i  where h is the enthalpy change hf is the final enthalpy of the system in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the products hi is the initial enthalpy of the system in a chemical reaction the enthalpy of the reactants for an exothermic reaction at constant pressure the systems change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings in a similar manner for an endothermic reaction the systems change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings a relatively easy way to determine whether or not a reaction is exothermic or endothermic is to determine the sign of h if h is positive the reaction is endothermic that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants on the other hand if h is negative the reaction is exothermic that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat specific enthalpyedit the specific enthalpy of a uniform system is defined as h hm where m is the mass of the system the si unit for specific enthalpy is joule per kilogram it can be expressed in other specific quantities by h u pv where u is the specific internal energy p is the pressure and v is specific volume which is equal to 1 where is the density enthalpy changesedit an enthalpy change describes the change in enthalpy observed in the constituents of a thermodynamic system when undergoing a transformation or chemical reaction it is the difference between the enthalpy after the process has completed ie the enthalpy of the products and the initial enthalpy of the system ie the reactants these processes are reversiblewhy and the enthalpy for the reverse process is the negative value of the forward change a common standard enthalpy change is the enthalpy of formation which has been determined for a large number of substances enthalpy changes are routinely measured and compiled in chemical and physical reference works such as the crc handbook of chemistry and physics the following is a selection of enthalpy changes commonly recognized in thermodynamics when used in these recognized terms the qualifier change is usually dropped and the property is simply termed enthalpy of process since these properties are often used as reference values it is very common to quote them for a standardized set of environmental parameters or standard conditions including a temperature of 25c or 298k a pressure of one atmosphere 1atm or 101.325kpa a concentration of 1.0m when the element or compound is present in solution elements or compounds in their normal physical states ie standard state for such standardized values the name of the enthalpy is commonly prefixed with the term standard eg standard enthalpy of formation chemical properties enthalpy of reaction

defined as the enthalpy change upon mixing of two non-reacting chemical substances open systemsedit in thermodynamic open systems matter may flow in and out of the system boundaries the first law of thermodynamics for open systems states the increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by matter flowing in and by heating minus the amount lost by matter flowing out and in the form of work done by the system d u q d u in d u out w  displaystyle dudelta qdu_textin-du_textout-delta w where uin is the average internal energy entering the system and uout is the average internal energy leaving the system during steady continuous operation an energy balance applied to an open system equates shaft work performed by the system to heat added plus net enthalpy added the region of space enclosed by the boundaries of the open system is usually called a control volume and it may or may not correspond to physical walls if we choose the shape of the control volume such that all flow in or out occurs perpendicular to its surface then the flow of matter into the system performs work as if it were a piston of fluid pushing mass into the system and the system performs work on the flow of matter out as if it were driving a piston of fluid there are then two types of work performed flow work described above which is performed on the fluid this is also often called pv work and shaft work which may be performed on some mechanical device these two types of work are expressed in the equation w d p out v out d p in v in w shaft  displaystyle delta

leaves it at point 2 the mass flow is  one of the simple applications of the concept of enthalpy is the so-called throttling process also known as joule-thomson expansion it concerns a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance valve porous plug or any other type of flow resistance as shown in the figure this process is very important since it is at the heart of domestic refrigerators where it is responsible for the temperature drop between ambient temperature and the interior of the refrigerator it is also the final stage in many types of liquefiers in the first law for open systems see above applied to the system all terms are zero except the terms for the enthalpy flow hence 0 m h 1 m h 2  displaystyle 0dot mh_1-dot mh_2 since the mass flow is constant the specific enthalpies at the two sides of the flow resistance are the same h 1 h 2  displaystyle h_1h_2 that is the enthalpy per unit mass does not change during the throttling the consequences of this relation can be demonstrated using the ts diagram above point c is at 200bar and room temperature 300k a joulethomson expansion from 200bar to 1bar follows a curve of constant enthalpy of roughly 425kjkg not shown in the diagram lying between the 400 and 450kjkg isenthalps and ends in point d which is at a temperature of about 270k hence the expansion from 200bar to 1bar cools nitrogen from 300k to 270k in the valve there is a lot of friction and a lot of entropy is produced but still the final temperature is below the starting value point e is chosen so that it is on the saturated liquid line with h 100 kjkg it corresponds roughly with p 13 bar and t 108 k throttling from this point to a pressure of 1bar ends in the two-phase region point f this means that a mixture of gas and liquid leaves the throttling valve since the enthalpy is an extensive parameter the enthalpy in f hf is equal to the enthalpy in g hg multiplied by the liquid fraction in f xf plus the enthalpy in h
