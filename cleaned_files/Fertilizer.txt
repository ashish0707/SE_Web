with and without nitrate fertilizer on nutrient-poor sandclay soil one of the plants in the nutrient-poor soil has died fertilizers enhance the growth of plants this goal is met in two ways the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients the second mode by some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration this article like many on fertilizers emphasises the nutritional aspect fertilizers typically provide in varying proportions1 three main macronutrients nitrogen n leaf growth phosphorus p development of roots flowers seeds fruit potassium k strong stem growth movement of water in plants promotion of flowering and fruiting three secondary macronutrients calcium ca magnesium mg and sulphur s micronutrients copper cu iron fe manganese mn molybdenum mo zinc zn boron b and of occasional significance there are silicon si cobalt co and vanadium v plus rare mineral catalysts the nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements but the elements are not used as fertilizers instead compounds containing these elements are the basis of fertilisers the macronutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15 to 6.0 on a dry matter dm 0 moisture basis plants are made up of four main elements hydrogen oxygen carbon and nitrogen carbon hydrogen and oxygen are widely available as water and carbon dioxide although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere it is in a form that is unavailable to plants nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in proteins dna and other components eg chlorophyll to be nutritious to plants nitrogen must be made available in a fixed form only some bacteria and their host plants notably legumes can fix atmospheric nitrogen n2 by converting it to ammonia phosphate is required for the production of dna and atp the main energy carrier in cells as well as certain lipids micronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of parts-per-million ppm ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm dm or less than 0.04 dm23 these elements are often present at the active sites of enzymes that carry out the plants metabolism because these elements enable catalysts enzymes their impact far exceeds their weight percentage classificationedit fertilizers are classified in several ways they are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient say n p or k in which case they are classified as straight fertilizers multinutrient fertilizers or complex fertilizers provide two or more nutrients for example n and p fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic the topic of most of this article versus organic inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except ureas organic fertilizers are usually recycled plant- or animal-derived matter inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture4 single nutrient straight fertilizersedit the main nitrogen-based straight fertilizer is ammonia or its solutions ammonium nitrate nh4no3 is also widely used about 15m tons were produced in 1981 urea is another popular source of nitrogen having the advantage that it is a solid and non-explosive unlike ammonia and ammonium nitrate respectively a few percent of the nitrogen fertilizer market 4 in 20075 has been met by calcium ammonium nitrate cano32nh4no310h2o the main straight phosphate fertilizers are the superphosphates single superphosphate ssp consists of 1418 p2o5 again in the form of cah2po42 but also phosphogypsum caso4 2 h2o triple superphosphate tsp typically consists of 44-48 of p2o5 and no gypsum a mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate more than 90 of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble multinutrient fertilizersedit these fertilizers are the most common they consist of two or more nutrient components binary np nk pk fertilizersedit major two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants these are called np fertilizers the main np fertilizers are monoammonium phosphate map and diammonium phosphate dap the active ingredient in map is nh4h2po4 the active ingredient in dap is nh42hpo4 about 85 of map and dap fertilizers are soluble in water npk fertilizersedit main article labeling of fertilizer npk fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk rating is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in a fertilizer npk ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes eg 10-10-10 or 16-4-8 describing the chemical content of fertilizers67 the first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product the second number p2o5 the third k2o fertilizers do not actually contain p2o5 or k2o but the system is a conventional shorthand for the amount of the phosphorus p or potassium k in a fertilizer a 50-pound 23kg bag of fertilizer labeled 16-4-8 contains 8lb 3.6kg of nitrogen 16 of the 50 pounds an amount of phosphorus equivalent to that in 2 pounds of p2o5 4 of 50 pounds and 4 pounds of k2o 8 of 50 pounds most fertilizers are labeled according to this n-p-k convention although australian convention following an n-p-k-s system adds a fourth number for sulfur8 micronutrientsedit the main micronutrients are molybdenum zinc and copper these elements are provided as water-soluble salts iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble bio-unavailable compounds at moderate soil ph and phosphate concentrations for this reason iron is often administered as a chelate complex eg the edta derivative the micronutrient needs depend on the plant for example sugar beets appear to require boron and legumes require cobalt9 productionedit nitrogen

ammonia is produced by the haber-bosch process5 in this energy-intensive process natural gas ch4 supplies the hydrogen and the nitrogen n2 is derived from the air this ammonia is used as a feedstock for all other nitrogen fertilizers such as anhydrous ammonium nitrate nh4no3 and urea conh22 deposits of sodium nitrate nano3 chilean saltpeter are also found in the atacama desert in chile and was one of the original 1830 nitrogen-rich fertilizers used12 it is still mined for fertilizer13 there has been technical work investigating on-site on-farm synthesis of nitrate fertilizer using solar photovoltaic power which would enable farmers more control in soil fertility while using far less surface area than conventional organic farming for nitrogen fertilizer14 phosphate fertilizersedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed september 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message all phosphate fertilizers are obtained by extraction from minerals containing the anion po43 in rare cases fields are treated with the crushed mineral but most often more soluble salts are produced by chemical treatment of phosphate minerals the most popular phosphate-containing minerals are referred to collectively as phosphate rock the main minerals are fluorapatite ca5po43f cfa and hydroxyapatite ca5po43oh these minerals are converted to water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with sulfuric or phosphoric acids the large production of sulfuric acid as an industrial chemical is primarily due to its use as cheap acid in processing phosphate rock into phosphate fertilizer the global primary uses for both sulfur and phosphorus compounds relate to this basic process in the nitrophosphate process or odda process invented in 1927 phosphate rock with up to a 20 phosphorus p content is dissolved with nitric acid hno3 to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid h3po4 and calcium nitrate cano32 this mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a compound fertilizer with the three macronutrients n p and k in easily dissolved form15 potassium fertilizersedit potash is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium chemical symbol k fertilizers potash is soluble in water so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps eg to remove sodium chloride nacl common salt sometimes potash is referred to as k2o as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content in fact potash fertilizers are usually potassium chloride potassium sulfate potassium carbonate or potassium nitrate16 compound fertilizersedit compound fertilizers which contain n p and k can often be produced by mixing straight fertilizers in some cases chemical reactions occur between the two or more components for example monoammonium and diammonium phosphates which provide plants with both n and p are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid from phosphate rock and ammonia nh3 h3po4 nh4h2po4 2 nh3 h3po4 nh42hpo4 organic fertilizersedit main article organic fertilizer compost bin for small-scale production of organic fertilizer a large commercial compost operation the main organic fertilizers are peat animal wastes plant wastes from agriculture and treated sewage sludge biosolidscitation needed in terms of volume peat is the most widely used organic fertilizercitation needed this immature form of coal confers no nutritional value to the plants but improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water animal sources include the products of the slaughter of animals bloodmeal bone meal hides hoofs and horns are typical components1 organic fertilizer usually contain fewer nutrients but offer other advantages as well as being appealing to those who are trying to practice environmentally friendly farming other elements calcium magnesium and sulfuredit calcium is supplied as superphosphate or calcium ammonium nitrate solutions applicationedit fertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops with application rates depending on the soil fertility usually as measured by a soil test and according to the particular crop legumes for example fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer liquid vs solidedit fertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid about 90 of fertilizers are applied as solids solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered often solids are available as prills a solid globule liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia aqueous solutions of ammonia aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea these concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer eg uan advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage1 the addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called fertigation16 slow- and controlled-release fertilizersedit slow- and controlled-release involve only 0.15 562,000 tons of the fertilizer market 1995 their utility stems from the fact that fertilizers are subject to antagonistic processes in addition to their providing the nutrition to plants excess fertilizers can be poisonous to the same plant competitive with the uptake by plants is the degradation or loss of the fertilizer microbes degrade many fertilizers eg by immobilization or oxidation furthermore fertilizers are lost by evaporation or leaching most slow-release fertilizers are derivatives of urea a straight fertilizer providing nitrogen isobutylidenediurea ibdu and urea-formaldehyde slowly convert in the soil to free urea which is rapidly uptaken by plants ibdu is a single compound with the formula ch32chchnhconh22 whereas the urea-formaldehydes consist of mixtures of the approximate formula hoch2nhconhnch2 besides being more efficient in the utilization of the applied nutrients slow-release technologies also reduce the impact on the environment and the contamination of the subsurface water17 slow-release fertilizers various forms including fertilizer spikes tabs etc which reduce the problem of burning the plants due to excess nitrogen polymer coating of fertilizer ingredients gives tablets and spikes a true time-release or staged nutrient release snr of fertilizer nutrients controlled release fertilizers are traditional fertilizers encapsulated in a shell that degrades at a specified rate sulfur is a typical encapsulation material other coated products use thermoplastics and sometimes ethylene-vinyl acetate and surfactants etc to produce diffusion-controlled release of urea or other fertilizers reactive layer coating can produce thinner hence cheaper membrane coatings by applying reactive monomers simultaneously to the soluble particles multicote is a process applying layers of low-cost fatty acid salts with a paraffin topcoat foliar applicationedit foliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves the method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high value crops such as fruits1 fertilizer burn chemicals that affect nitrogen uptakeedit various chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers in this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off nitrification inhibitors also known as nitrogen stabilizers suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate an anion that is more prone to leaching 1-carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole cmp dicyandiamide and nitrapyrin 2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine are popular urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification the conversion of urea to ammonia catalyzed by enzymes called ureases a popular inhibitor of ureases is n-n-butylthiophosphoric triamide nbpt overfertilizationedit careful fertilization technologies are important because excess nutrients can be as detrimental18 fertilizer burn can occur when too much fertilizer is applied resulting in drying out of the leaves and damage or even death of the plant19unreliable source fertilizers vary in their tendency to burn roughly in accordance with their salt index20 statisticsedit the map displays the statistics of fertilizer consumption in western and central european counties from data published by the world bank for 2012 conservative estimates report 30 to 50 of crop yields are attributed to natural or synthetic commercial fertilizer1621 global market value is likely to rise to more than us185 billion until 2019.22 the european fertilizer market will grow to earn revenues of approx 15.3 billion in 2018.23 data on the fertilizer consumption per hectare arable land in 2012 are published by the world bank24 for the diagram below values of the european union eu countries have been extracted and are presented as kilograms per hectare pounds per acre the total consumption of fertilizer in the eu is 15.9 million tons for 105 million hectare arable land area25 or 107 million hectare arable land according to another estimate26 this figure equates to 151kg of fertilizers consumed per ha arable land on average for the eu countries interestingly mainly in those countries where fertilizers are consumed a lot also plant growth product are sold more than in others see p5 in thumbnail pesticide categories maps on the right pesticide categories27 eurostat p5 plant growth regulators the redgreen scale represents highlow pesticide sales per arable land environmental effectsedit runoff of soil and fertilizer during a rain storm an algal bloom caused by eutrophication see also environmental impact of agriculture human impact on the nitrogen cycle nitrogen fertilizer problems with inorganic fertilizer and planetary boundaries biogeochemical wateredit main article eutrophication agricultural run-off is a major contributor to the eutrophication of fresh water bodies for example in the us about half of all the lakes are eutrophic the main contributor to eutrophication is phosphate which is normally a limiting nutrient high concentrations promote the growth of cyanobacteria and algae the demise of which consumes oxygen28 cyanobacteria blooms algal blooms can also produce harmful toxins that can accumulate in the food chain and can be harmful to humans2930 the nitrogen-rich compounds found in fertilizer runoff are the primary cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of oceans especially in coastal zones lakes and rivers the resulting lack of dissolved oxygen greatly reduces the ability of these areas to sustain oceanic fauna31 the number of oceanic dead zones near inhabited coastlines are increasing32 as of 2006 the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern europe33 and the united states3435 if eutrophication can be reversed it may take decadescitation needed before the accumulated nitrates in groundwater can be broken down by natural processes nitrate pollutionedit only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter the remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off36 high application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water solubility of nitrate leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater thereby causing groundwater pollution373839 the excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers be they synthetic or natural is particularly damaging as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached40 nitrate levels above 10mgl 10 ppm in groundwater can cause blue baby syndrome acquired methemoglobinemia41 the nutrients especially nitrates in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwatercitation needed soiledit acidificationedit see also soil ph and soil acidification nitrogen-containing fertilizers can cause soil acidification when added4243 this may lead to decreases in nutrient availability which may be offset by liming accumulation of toxic elementsedit cadmiumedit the concentration of cadmium in phosphorus-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic44 for example mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14mgkg or as high as 50.9mgkg.45 this is because the phosphate rock used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188mgkg cadmium46 examples are deposits on nauru47 and the christmas islands48 continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil as shown in new zealand49 and plants50 limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the european commission515253 producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content28 fluorideedit phosphate rocks contain high levels of fluoride consequently the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations50 it has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils5455 also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms545556 radioactive elementsedit the radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process5057 uranium-238 concentrations range can range from 7 to 100 pcig in phosphate rock58 and from 1 to 67 pcig in phosphate fertilizers596061 where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present6062 however the impact of these increases on the risk to human health from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small less than 0.05 msvy606364 other metalsedit steel industry wastes recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of zinc essential to plant growth wastes can include the following toxic metals lead65 arsenic cadmium65 chromium and nickel the most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are mercury lead and arsenic666768 these potentially harmful impurities can be removed however this significantly increases cost highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households such as miracle-gro these highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities there are also some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers made with high purity ingredients trace mineral depletionedit attention has been addressed to the decreasing concentrations of elements such as iron zinc copper and magnesium in many foods over the last 5060 years6970 intensive farming practices including the use of synthetic fertilizers are frequently suggested as reasons for these declines and organic farming is often suggested as a solution70 although improved crop yields resulting from npk fertilizers are known to dilute the concentrations of other nutrients in plants6971 much of the measured decline can be attributed to the use of progressively higher-yielding crop varieties which produce foods with lower mineral concentrations than their less productive ancestors697273 it is therefore unlikely that organic farming or reduced use of fertilizers will solve the problem foods with high nutrient density are posited to be achieved using older lower-yielding varieties or the development of new high-yield nutrient-dense varieties6974 fertilizers are in fact more likely to solve trace mineral deficiency problems than cause them in western australia deficiencies of zinc copper manganese iron and molybdenum were identified as limiting the growth of broad-acre crops and pastures in the 1940s and 1950s.75 soils in western australia are very old highly weathered and deficient in many of the major nutrients and trace elements75 since this time these trace elements are routinely added to fertilizers used in agriculture in this state75 many other soils around the world are deficient in zinc leading to deficiency in both plants and humans and zinc fertilizers are widely used to solve this problem76 changes in soil biologyedit high levels of fertilizer may cause the breakdown of the symbiotic relationships between plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi77 energy consumption and sustainabilityedit in the usa in 2004 317 billion cubic feet of natural gas were consumed in the industrial production of ammonia less than 1.5 of total us annual consumption of natural gas78 a 2002 report suggested that the production of ammonia consumes about 5 of global natural gas consumption which is somewhat under 2 of world energy production79 ammonia is produced from natural gas and air80 the cost of natural gas makes up about 90 of the cost of producing ammonia81 the increase in price of natural gases over the past decade along with other factors such as increasing demand have contributed to an increase in fertilizer price82 contribution to climate changeedit the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide are produced during the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer the effects can be combined into an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide the amount varies according to the efficiency of the process the figure for the united kingdom is over 2 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide equivalent for each kilogramme of ammonium nitrate83 nitrogen fertilizer can be converted by soil bacteria to nitrous oxide a greenhouse gas atmosphereedit global methane concentrations surface and atmospheric for 2005 note distinct plumes through the increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer which was used at a rate of about 110 million tons of n per year in 2012,8485 adding to the already existing amount of reactive nitrogen nitrous oxide n2o has become the third most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane it has a global warming potential 296 times larger than an equal mass of carbon dioxide and it also contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion86 by changing processes and procedures it is possible to mitigate some but not all of these effects on anthropogenic climate change87 methane emissions from crop fields notably rice paddy fields are increased by the application of ammonium-based fertilizers these emissions contribute to global climate change as methane is a potent greenhouse gas8889 regulationedit in europe problems with high nitrate concentrations in run-off are being addressed by the european unions nitrates directive90 within britain farmers are encouraged to manage their land more sustainably in catchment-sensitive farming91 in the us high concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in runoff and drainage water are classified as non-point source pollutants due to their diffuse origin this pollution is regulated at state level92 oregon and washington both in the united states have fertilizer registration programs with on-line databases listing chemical analyses of fertilizers9394 historyedit founded in 1812 mirat producer of manures and fertilizers is claimed to be the oldest industrial business in salamanca spain main article history of fertilizer management of soil fertility has been the preoccupation of farmers for thousands of years egyptians romans babylonians and early germans all are recorded as using minerals and or manure to enhance the productivity of their farms9 the modern science of plant nutrition started in the 19th century and the work of german chemist justus von liebig among others john bennet lawes an english entrepreneur began to experiment on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837 and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field one immediate consequence was that in 1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulphuric acid and thus was the first to create the artificial manure industry in the succeeding year he enlisted the services of joseph henry gilbert with whom he carried on for more than half a century on experiments in raising crops at the institute of arable crops research95 the birkelandeyde process was one of the competing industrial processes in the beginning of nitrogen based fertilizer production96 this process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen n2 into nitric acid hno3 one of several chemical processes generally referred to as nitrogen fixation the resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate no3 a factory based on the process was built in rjukan and notodden in norway combined with the building of large hydroelectric power facilities97 the 1910s and 1920s witness the rise of the haber process and the ostwald process the haber process produces ammonia nh3 from methane ch4 gas and molecular nitrogen n2 the ammonia from the haber process is then converted into nitric acid hno3 in the ostwald process98 the development of synthetic fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth it has been estimated that almost half the people on the earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use99 the use of commercial fertilizers has increased steadily in the last 50 years rising almost 20-fold to the current rate of 100 million tonnes of nitrogen per year100 without commercial fertilizers it is estimated that about one-third of the food produced now could not be produced101 the use of phosphate fertilizers has also increased from 9 million tonnes per year in 1960 to 40 million tonnes per year in 2000 a maize crop yielding 69 tonnes of grain per hectare 2.5 acres requires 3150 kilograms 68110lb of phosphate fertilizer to be applied soybean crops require about half as 2025kg per hectare102 yara international is the worlds largest producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers103 controlled-nitrogen-release technologies based on polymers derived from combining urea and formaldehyde were first produced in 1936 and commercialized in 1955.17 the early product had 60 percent of the total nitrogen cold-water-insoluble and the unreacted quick-release less than 15 methylene ureas were commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s having 25 and 60 of the nitrogen as cold-water-insoluble and unreacted urea nitrogen in the range of 15 to 30 in the 1960s the tennessee valley authority national fertilizer development center began developing sulfur-coated urea sulfur was used as the principal coating material because of its low cost and its value as a secondary nutrient17 usually there is another wax or polymer which seals the sulfur the slow-release properties depend on the degradation of the secondary sealant by soil microbes as well as mechanical imperfections cracks etc in the sulfur they typically provide 6 to 16 weeks of delayed release in turf applications when a hard polymer is used as the secondary coating the properties are a cross between diffusion-controlled particles and traditional sulfur-coated see alsoedit agroecology circulus theory fertigation food and agriculture organization history of organic farming milorganite
