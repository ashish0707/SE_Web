trading that specifically targets carbon dioxide calculated in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or tco2e and it currently constitutes the bulk of emissions trading this form of permit trading is a common method countries utilize in order to meet their obligations specified by the kyoto protocol namely the reduction of carbon emissions in an attempt to reduce mitigate future climate change under carbon trading a country having more emissions of carbon is able to purchase the right to emit more and the country having less emission trades the right to emit carbon to other countries more carbon emitting countries by this way try to keep the limit of carbon emission specified to them contents 1 economics 1.1 costs and valuation 1.2 ethics and fairness 1.3 coase 1.4 equity 1.5 taxes versus

economicsedit emissions trading works by setting a quantitative limit on the emissions produced by emitters the economic basis for emissions trading is linked to the concept of property rights goldemberg et al 1996 p291 costs and valuationedit the economic problem with climate change is that the emitters of greenhouse gases ghgs do not face the full cost implications of their actions imf 2008 p62 there are costs that emitters do face eg the costs of the fuel being used but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service these other costs are called external costs halsns et al 2007.3 they are external because they are costs that the emitter does not face external costs may affect the welfare of others in the case of climate change ghg emissions affect the welfare of people living in the future as well as affecting the natural environment toth et al 2001.4 these external costs can be estimated and converted in a common monetary unit the argument for doing this is that these external costs can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces in doing this the emitter faces the full social costs of their actions imf 2008 p9 ethics and fairnessedit the way of dealing with climate change has particular ethical issues and other issues related to the fairness of the problem to actually calculate social costs requires value judgements about the value of future climate impacts smith et al 2001.5 there is no consensus among economists over how to value the fairness economists use the term equity to mean fairness of a particular climate policy eg how to share the burden of costs for mitigating future climate change toth et al 2001.6 nor do economists have any professional expertise in making ethical decisions eg over the value assigned to the welfare of future generations arrow et al 1996 p1307 typically all the impacts of policy both the costs and benefits are added together aggregation with different impacts on different individuals assigned particular weightings ie relative levels of importance these valuations are decided by the economist doing the study valuations can be difficult since not all goods have a market price there are methods to infer prices for non-market goods and services however these valuations can be controversial eg valuations of human health impacts or ecosystems smith et al 2001.8 there is also controversy over how potentially positive climate impacts eg tourism in particular regions benefiting from climate change offset negative impacts in other regions eg reduced food production smith et al 2001.9 the main advantage of economic analysis in this area is that it allows a comprehensive and consistent treatment of climate change impacts it also allows the benefits of climate change policy decisions to be compared against other possible environmental policies coaseedit coase 1960 referred to by toth et al 200110 and helm 2005 p411 argued that social costs could be accounted for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective coases model assumes perfectly operating markets and equal bargaining power among those arguing for property rights for climate change the property rights are for emissions permits or quotas however it should be noted that other factors affect the climate other than just emissions eg the ocean forests etc goldemberg et al 1996 pp28291 in coases model efficiency ie achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost is promoted by the market system this can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions flexibility is desirable because the marginal costs that is to say the incremental costs of reducing emissions varies among countries emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest bashmakov et al 2001.12 over time efficiency can also be promoted by allowing banking of permits goldemberg et al 1996 p30 this allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so equityedit one of the advantages of coases model is that it suggests that fairness equity can be addressed in the distribution of property rights and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned the market will produce the most efficient outcome goldemberg et al 1996 p291 in reality according to the held view markets are not perfect and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency halsns et al 2007.13 taxes versus capsedit a large number of papers in the economics literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading carbon trust 2009.14 counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes bashmakov et al 2001.15 one of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries rather than the revenues going to the government in comparison industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax it is therefore argued that with emissions trading polluters have an incentive to cut emissions but if they are exempted from a carbon tax they have no incentive to cut emissions smith 2008 pp565716 on the other hand freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour world bank 2010 p26817 a pure carbon tax fixes the price of carbon but allows the amount of carbon emissions to vary and a pure carbon cap places a limit on carbon emissions letting the market price of tradable carbon allowances vary proponents argue that a carbon tax is more easy and simple to enforce on a broad-base scale than cap-and-trade programs the simplicity and immediacy of a carbon tax has been proven effective in british columbia canada - enacted and implemented in five months taxing can provide the right incentives for polluters inventors and engineers to develop cleaner technologies in addition to creating revenue for the government 18 supporters of carbon cap-and-trade systems believe it sets legal limits for emissions reductions unlike with carbon taxes with a tax there can be estimates of reduction in carbon emissions which may not be sufficient to change the course of climate change a declining cap gives allowance for firm reduction targets and a system for measuring when targets are met it also allows for flexibility unlike rigid taxes18 providing emission permits under emissions trading is preferred in situations where more accurate target level of environment certainty is needed19 tradingedit in an emissions trading system permits may be traded by emitters who are liable to hold a sufficient number of permits in system some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading eg private brokerage firms can allow for better management of risk in the system eg to variations in permit prices bashmakov et al 2001.20 it may also improve the efficiency of system according to bashmakov et al 2001 regulation of these other entities may be necessary as is done in other financial markets eg to prevent abuses of the system such as insider trading incentives and allocationedit emissions trading gives polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions however there are possible perverse incentives that can exist in emissions trading allocating permits on the basis of past emissions grandfathering can result in firms having an incentive to maintain emissions for example a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future imf 2008 pp25262 this problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions goldemberg et al 1996 p381 on the other hand a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away provides the government with revenues these revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy eg by funding reductions in distortionary taxes fisher et al 1996 p41721 in coases model of social costs either choice grandfathering or auctioning leads to efficiency in reality grandfathering subsidizes polluters meaning that polluting industries may be kept in business longer than would otherwise occurcitation needed grandfathering may also reduce the rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies fisher et al 1996 p417 the economist william nordhaus argues that allocations cost the economy as they cause the under utilisation an efficient form of taxation22 nordhaus points out that normal income goods or service taxes distort efficient investment and consumption so by using pollution taxes to generate revenue an emissions scheme can increase the efficiency of the economy22 form of allocation the economist ross garnaut states that permits allocated to existing emitters by grandfathering are not free as the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter the cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs23 it is important that we stop thinking in terms of payments to australian firms in order to compensate them for the effects of the domestic emissions trading scheme there is no basis for compensation arising from the loss of profits or asset values as a result of this new policy the rationale for payments to trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries is different and sound it is to avoid the economic and environmental costs of having firms in these industries contracting more than and failing to expand as much as they would in a world in which all countries were applying carbon constraints involving similar costs to ours 24 unitsedit the units which may be transferred under article 17clarification needed emissions trading each equal to one metric tonne of emissions in co2-equivalent terms may be in the form of25 an assigned amount unit aau issued by an annex i party on the basis of its assigned amount pursuant to articles 3.7 and 3.8 of the protocol a removal unit rmu issued by an annex i party on the basis of land use land-use change and forestry lulucf activities under articles 3.3 and 3.4 of the kyoto protocol an emission reduction unit eru generated by a joint implementation project under article 6 of the kyoto protocol a certified emission reduction cer generated from a clean development mechanism project activity under article 12 of the kyoto protocol transfers and acquisitions of these units are to be tracked and recordedclarification needed through the registry systems under the kyoto protocolcitation needed market trendedit carbon emissions trading has been steadily increasing in recent years according to the world banks carbon finance unit 374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2e were exchanged through projects in 2005 a 240 increase relative to 2004 110 mtco2e26 which was itself a 41 increase relative to 2003 78 mtco2e27 the increasing costs of permits have had the effect of increasing costs of carbon emitting fuels and activities based on a survey of 12 european countries it was concluded that an increase in carbon and fuel prices of approximately ten percent would result in a short-run increase in electrical power prices of roughly eight percent28 this would suggest that a lowering cap on carbon emissions will likely lead to an increase in the costs of alternative power sources whereas a sudden lowering of a carbon emission cap may prove detrimental to economies a gradual lowering of the cap may risk future environmental damage via global warming in 2010 chicago climate exchange ccx ceased its trading of carbon emissions29 450 members of the ccx had achieved reductions of 700million tonnes of emissions over the life of the cap and trade program the seven year ccx cap and trade program claimed to have successfully provided cost-effectiveness and market-based flexibility for emissions trading30 business reactionedit economist craig mellow wrote in may 78 2008 the combination of global warming and growing environmental consciousness is creating a potentially huge market in the trading of pollution-emission credits 31 with the creation of a market for mandatory trading of carbon dioxide emissions within the kyoto protocol the london financial marketplace has established itself as the center of the carbon finance market and is expected to have grown into a market valued at 60 billion in 2007.32not in citation given the voluntary offset market by comparison is projected to grow to about 4bn by 2010.33 twenty three multinational corporations came together in the g8 climate change roundtable a business group formed at the january 2005 world economic forum the group included ford toyota british airways bp and unilever on 9 june 2005 the group published a statement stating that there was a need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions it called on governments to establish clear transparent and consistent price signals through creation of a long-term policy framework that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases34 by december 2007 this had grown to encompass 150 global businesses35 business in the uk have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change supported by green ngos36 voluntary surrender of unitsedit there are examples of individuals and organisations purchasing tradable emission permits and retiring cancelling them so they cannot be used by emitters to authorise their emissions this makes the emissions cap lower and therefore further reduces emissions in 1992 the national healthy air license exchange was established to pool donations for buying and retiring sulfur allowances under the usa sulfur allowance trading program37 the british organization climakind accepts donations and uses them to buy and cancel european allowances the carbon credits traded in the european union emission trading system it is argued that this removes the credits from the carbon market so they cannot be used to allow the emission of carbon and that this reduces the cap on emissions by reducing the number of credits available to emitters38 the british organisation sandbag promotes cancelling carbon credits in order to lower emissions trading caps39 as of august 2010 sandbag states that it has cancelled carbon credits equivalent to 2145 tonnes of co240 criticismsedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material october 2014 critics of carbon trading such as carbon trade watch argue that it places disproportionate emphasis on individual lifestyles and carbon footprints distracting attention from the wider systemic changes and collective political action that needs to be taken to tackle climate change41full citation needed groups such as the corner house have argued that the market will choose the easiest means to save a given quantity of carbon in the short term which may be different from the pathway required to obtain sustained and sizable reductions over a longer period and so a market-led approach is likely to reinforce technological lock-in for instance small cuts may often be achieved cheaply through investment in making a technology more efficient where larger cuts would require scrapping the technology and using a different one they also argue that emissions trading is undermining alternative approaches to pollution controlclarification needed with which it does not combine well and so the overall effect it is having is to actually stall significant change to less polluting technologies in september 2010 campaigning group fern released trading carbon how it works and why it is controversial 42full citation neededwhich compiles many of the arguments against carbon trading the financial times published an article about cap-and-trade systems which argued that carbon markets create a muddle and leave much room for unverifiable manipulation43 lohmann 2009 pointed out that emissions trading schemes create new uncertainties and risksvague which can be commodified by means of derivatives thereby creating a new speculative market44clarification needed in china some companies started artificial production of greenhouse gases with sole purpose of their recycling and gaining carbon credits similar practices happened in india earned credit were then sold to companies in us and europe4546 recent proposals for alternative schemes to avoid the problems of cap-and-trade schemes include cap and shareclarification needed which was being actively considered by the irish parliament in may 2008 and the sky trust schemes47 these schemes state that cap-and-trade or cap-and-taxclarification needed schemes inherently impact the poor and those in rural areas who have less choice in energy consumption options carbon trading has been criticised as a form of colonialism in which rich countries maintain their levels of consumption while getting credit for carbon savings in inefficient industrial projects48 nations that have fewer financial resources may find that they cannot afford the permits necessary for developing an industrial infrastructure thus inhibiting these countries economic development the kyoto protocols clean development mechanism has been criticised for not promoting enough sustainable development another criticism is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the kyoto protocol due to the surplus of allowances that some countries possess for example russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse following the end of the soviet union48 other countries could have bought these allowances from russia but this would not have reduced emissions rather it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions allowances in practice kyoto parties have as yet chosen not to buy these surplus allowances49 structuring issuesedit corporate and governmental carbon emission trading schemes a trading system devised by economists to reduce co2
