months9 when planning a family women should be aware that reproductive risks increase with the age of the woman like older men older women have a higher chance of having a child with autism or down

adolescent girls the united nations population fund unfpa says that contraceptives prevent unintended pregnancies reduce the number of abortions and lower the incidence of death and disability related to complications of pregnancy and childbirth 11 unfpa states that if all women with an unmet need for contraceptives were able to use modern methods an additional 24 million abortions 14 million of which would be unsafe 6 million miscarriages 70,000 maternal deaths and 500,000 infant deaths would be prevented 11 in cases where couples may not want to have children just yet family planning

methods are available to prevent unwanted pregnancy there are a range of contraceptive methods each with particular advantages and disadvantages behavioral methods to avoid pregnancy that involve vaginal intercourse include the withdrawal and calendar-based methods which have little up front cost and are readily available but are much less effective in typical use than most other methods long-acting reversible contraceptive methods such as intrauterine device iud and implant are highly effective and convenient requiring little user action when cost of failure is included iuds and vasectomy are much less costly than other methods in addition to providing birth control male andor female condoms protect against sexually transmitted diseases std condoms may be used alone or in addition to other methods as backup or to prevent std surgical methods tubal ligation vasectomy provide long-term contraception for those who have completed their families14 assisted reproductive technologyedit main article assisted reproductive technology when for any reason a woman is unable to conceive by natural means she may seek assisted conception for example some families or women seek assistance through surrogacy in which a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for another couple or person there are two types of surrogacy traditional and gestational in traditional surrogacy the surrogate uses her own eggs and carries the child for her intended parents this procedure is done in a doctors office through iui this type of surrogacy obviously includes a genetic connection between the surrogate and the child legally the surrogate will have to disclaim any interest in the child to complete the transfer to the intended parents a gestational surrogacy occurs when the intended mothers or a donor egg is fertilized outside the body and then the embryos are transferred into the uterus the woman who carries the child is often referred to as a gestational carrier the legal steps to confirm parentage with the intended parents are generally easier than in a traditional because there is no genetic connection between child and carrier15 sperm donation is another form of assisted conception it involves donated sperm being used to fertilise a womans ova by artificial insemination either by intracervical insemination or intrauterine insemination and less commonly by invitro fertilization ivf but insemination may also be achieved by a donor having sexual intercourse with a woman for the purpose of achieving conception this method is known as natural insemination ni mapping of a womans ovarian reserve follicular dynamics and associated biomarkers can give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy facilitating an informed choice of when to have children16 financesedit see also family economics and cost of raising a child family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions17 the cost savings stem from a reduction in unintended pregnancy as well as a reduction in transmission of sexually transmitted infections including hiv17 childbirth and prenatal health care cost averaged 7,090 for normal delivery in the united states in 1996.18 us department of agriculture estimates that for a child born in 2007 a us family will spend an average of 11,000 to 23,000 per year for the first 17 years of childs life5 total inflation-adjusted estimated expenditure 196,000 to 393,000 depending on household income5 breaks down cost by age type of expense region of country adjustments for number of children one child spend 24 more 3 or more spend less on each child investing in family planning has clear economic benefits and can also help countries to achieve their demographic dividend which means that countries productivity is able to increase when there are more people in the workforce and less dependents11 unfpa says that for every dollar invested in contraception the cost of pregnancy-related care is reduced by 1.47.11 unfpa states that the lifetime opportunity cost related to adolescent pregnancy a measure of the annual income a young mother misses out on over her lifetime ranges from 1 per cent of annual gross domestic product in a large country such as china to 30 per cent of annual gdp in a small economy such as uganda if adolescent girls in brazil and india were able to wait until their early twenties to have children the increased economic productivity would equal more than 3.5 billion and 7.7 billion respectively11 international oversightedit see also international planned parenthood federation marie stopes international and united states agency for international development the worlds largest international source of funding for population and reproductive health programs is the united nations population fund unfpa in 1994 the international conference on population and development set the main goals of its program of action as universal access to

expectancy at birth reducing hiv infection rates in persons aged 1524 years by 25 in the most-affected countries by 2005 and by 25 globally by 2010 the world health organization who and world bank

planning human rights developmentedit access to safe voluntary family planning is a human right and is central to gender equality womens empowerment and poverty reduction the united nations population fund unfpa says that some 225 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using safe and effective family planning methods for reasons ranging from lack access to information or services to lack of support from their partners or communities 24 unfpa says that most of these women with an unmet need for contraceptives live in 69 of the poorest countries on earth 24 over the past 50 years right-based family planning has enabled the cycle of poverty to be broken resulting in millions of women and childrens lives being saved24 unfpa says that global consensus that family planning is a human right was secured at the 1994 international conference on population and development in principle 8 of the programme of action all couples and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information education and means to do so 24 as part of the united nations millennium development goals mdgs universal access to family planning is one of the key factors contributing to development and reducing poverty family planning creates benefits in areas such as gender quality and womens health access to sexual education and higher education and improvements in maternal and child health24 unfpa and the guttmacher institute say that serving all women in developing countries that currently have an unmet need for modern contraceptives would prevent an additional 54 million unintended pregnancies including 21 million unplanned births 26 million abortions of which 16 million would have been unsafe and seven million miscarriages this would also prevent 79,000 maternal deaths and 1.1 million infant deaths25 regional variationsedit a family planning facility in kuala terengganu malaysia africaedit main article

of all women use birth control although over half of all african women would like to use birth control if it was available to them3132 the main problems that preventing access to and use of birth control are unavailability poor health care services spousal disapproval religious concerns and misinformation about the effects of birth control31 the most available type of birth control is condoms33 a rapidly growing population coupled with an increase in preventable diseases means countries in sub-saharan africa face an increasingly younger population chinaedit this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information june 2016 main article family planning policy chinas family planning policy forced couples to have no more than one child beginning in 1979 and being officially phased out in 2015,34 the policy was instated to control the rapid population growth that was occurring in the nation at that time with the rapid change in population china was facing many impacts including poverty and homelessness as a developing nation the chinese government was concerned that a continuation of the rapid population growth that had been occurring would hinder their development as a nation the process of family planning varied throughout china as people differed in their responsiveness to the one-child policy based on location and socioeconomic status for example many families in the cities accepted the policy more readily based on the lack of space money and resources that often occurs in the cities another example can be found in the enforcement of this rule people living in rural areas of china were in some cases permitted to have more than one child but had to wait several years after the birth of the first one35 however the people in rural areas of china were more hesitant in accepting this policy chinas population policy has been credited with a very significant slowing of chinas population growth which had been higher before the policy was implemented however the policy has come under criticism that it has resulted in the abuse of women often implementation of the policy has involved forced abortions forced sterilization and infanticides that families desired a male child had a part to play in the number of infanticides the number of girls that die within their first year of birth is twice that of boys36 another drawback of the policy is that chinas elderly population is now increasing rapidly37 however while the punishment of unplanned pregnancy is a large fine both forced abortion and forced sterilization can be charged with intentional assault which is punished with up to ten years imprisonment another issue that is raised in the one-child policy in china is the information in regards to naturally giving birth to twins or triplets if this situation arises the family is allowed to keep the children because of the natural causes of this impregnationcitation needed family planning in china had its benefits and its drawbacks for example it helped reduce the population by about 300 million people in its first 20 years38 a drawback is that there are now millions of sibling-fewer people and in china siblings are very important once the parent generation gets older the children help take care of them and the work is usually equally split among the siblings39 another benefit of the implementation of the one-child law is that it reduced the fertility rate from about 2.75 children born per woman to about 1.8 children born per woman in the 1979.40

contraceptives was illegal in ireland from 1935 until 1980 when it was legalized with strong restrictions later loosened it has been argued that the resulting demographic dividend played a role in the economic boom in ireland that began in the 1990s and ended abruptly in 2008 the celtic tiger was in part due to the legalisation of contraception in 1979 and subsequent decline in the fertility rate51
