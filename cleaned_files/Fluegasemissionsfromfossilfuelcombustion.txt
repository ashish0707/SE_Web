before flue-gas desulfurization was installed emissions from four corners generating station new mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion refers to the combustion-product gas resulting from the burning of fossil fuels1 most fossil fuels are combusted with ambient air as differentiated from combustion with pure oxygen since ambient air contains about 79 volume percent gaseous nitrogen n22 which is essentially non-combustible the largest part of the flue gas from most fossil-fuel combustion is uncombusted nitrogen carbon dioxide co2 the next largest part of flue gas can be as much as 1025 volume percent or more of the flue gas this is closely followed in volume by water vapor h2o created by the combustion of the hydrogen in the fuel with atmospheric oxygen much of the smoke seen pouring from flue gas stacks is this water vapor forming a cloud as it contacts cool air a typical flue gas from the combustion of fossil fuels contains very small amounts of nitrogen oxides nox sulfur dioxide so2 and particulate matter1 the nitrogen oxides are derived from the nitrogen in the ambient air as well as from any nitrogen-containing compounds in the fossil fuel the sulfur dioxide is derived from any sulfur-containing compounds in the fuels the particulate matter is composed of very small particles of solid materials and very small liquid droplets which give flue gases their smoky appearance the steam generators in large power plants and the process furnaces in large refineries petrochemical and chemical plants and incinerators burn considerable amounts of fossil fuels and therefore emit large amounts of flue gas to the ambient atmosphere the table below presents the total amounts of flue gas typically generated by the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas fuel oil and coal the data were obtained by stoichiometric3 calculations4 it is of interest to note that the total amount of flue gas generated by coal combustion is only 10 percent higher than the flue gas generated by natural-gas combustion exhaust flue gas generated by combustion of fossil fuels in si metric units and in us customary units combustion data fuel gas fuel oil coal fuel properties gross caloric value mjm 43.01 gross heating value btuscf 1,093 gross caloric value mjkg 43.50 gross heating value btugalvague 150,000 gross caloric value mjkg 25.92 gross heating value btulb 11,150 molecular weight 18 specific gravity 0.9626 gravity api 15.5 carbonhydrogen ratio by weight 8.1 weight carbon 61.2 weight hydrogen 4.3 weight oxygen 7.4 weight sulfur 3.9 weight nitrogen 1.2 weight ash 12.0 weight moisture 10.0 combustion air excess combustion air 12 15 20 wet exhaust flue gas amount of wet exhaust gas mgj of fuel 294.8 303.1 323.1 amount of wet exhaust gas scf106 btu of fuel 11,600 11,930 12,714 co2 in wet exhaust gas volume 8.8 12.4 13.7 o2 in wet exhaust gas volume 2.0 2.6 3.4 molecular weight of wet exhaust gas 27.7 29.0 29.5 dry exhaust flue gas amount of dry exhaust gas mgj of fuel 241.6 269.3 293.6 amount of dry exhaust gas scf106 btu of fuel 9,510 10,600 11,554 co2 in dry exhaust gas volume 10.8 14.0 15.0 o2 in dry exhaust gas volume 2.5 2.9 3.7 molecular weight of dry exhaust gas 29.9 30.4 30.7 note m are standard cubic meters at 0 c and 101.325 kpa and scf is standard cubic feet at 60 f and 14.696 psia see alsoedit ap 42 compilation of air pollutant emission factors emission standard flue-gas stack flue gas flue-gas desulfurization gas stoichiometry stoichiometry referencesedit a b compilation of air pollutant emission factors perry rh and green dw editors 1997 perrys chemical engineers handbook 7th ed mcgraw hill isbn isbn 0-07-049841-5 cs1 maint multiple names authors list link zumdahl steven s 2005 chemical principles 5th ed houghton mifflin college division isbn0-618-37206-7 air dispersion modeling conversions and formulas external linksedit article on flue gas treatment including desulfurization and the removal of hydrogen chloride sulphur trioxide and mercury
