despite the historic usage of wind power to drain water and grind grain the netherlands today lags behind most eu countries in the production of energy from renewable sources the leading renewable sources in the country are biomass wind solar and both geothermal and aerothermal power mostly from ground source and air source heat pumps in 2014 the netherlands produced only 5.5 of its total energy from renewables a small rise from 3.7 in 2010 and just 1 in 1990.1 among the eu countries only malta and luxembourg had lower percentages2 the low take up of renewable energy may be partially explained by the flat and often sub-sea level landscape and subsequent limits to hydropower resources as well as little natural geothermal potentialcitation needed although hydro poor resource countries such as denmark have still managed to make renewables the focus of their energy needs in 2015 dutch wind turbines had a total nameplate capacity of 3,431 mw3 most of the tiny contribution made to electricity generation by hydroelectricity came from three power plants a large part of the renewable electricity sold in the netherlands comes from norway a country which generates almost all its electricity from hydropower plants in the netherlands household consumers can choose to buy renewable electricity since 2008 the amount of renewable energy used by household users has been increasing rising from 38 in 2008 to 41 by 2009 and up to 44 by mid 2010.4 one area in which the netherlands is a relative leader is in the adoption of electric plug in vehicles in 2015 pev vehicles in the netherlands represented 9.74 of car sales5 making it the worlds second highest share after norway electric vehicles are able to run on renewable electricity with zero emissions and have the potential to provide grid power storage facilities6 an interesting source of heat recovery used in the netherlands is sourced from freshly milked milk or warm milk however at 0.3 of total renewable energy production1 2010 figures this source is not likely to accelerate energy transition in the country warm milk is still not mentioned in the eu renewable energy directive nor in international energy statistics and so is not included is gross final consumption figures it does however provide dutch farmers with plenty of hot water contents 1 recent trends in renewable energy 2 sources 2.1

minimum target of 14 of renewable energy use by 2020 the sectoral targets for 2020 break down into national targets of 8.7 in the heating and cooling sector 37 in the electricity sector and 10.3 in the transport sector although these figures may be slightly different from those implied by the minimum trajectory path7 the following table shows the actual results recorded of renewable energy use

wood is also collected for use in the netherlands and other eu countries manure is used to produce biogas and wood pellets are co-fired in electricity plants 590 kton of pellets were imported mostly from the united states of america and around 140 kton from dutch sources contributing 12 to 13 pj of primary energy to co-firing in energy plants in 2013-2014 biofuels are produced in the netherlands for both domestic and export markets13 rapeseed and corn crops were hardly used in 2014 to produce biofuels in holland with reasons cited being the high price of corn and resistance to using food crops for fuel production rapeseed is used for well over 1 of the imported biofuels biodiesel while corn is used for 11 bioethanol germany was the largest supplier of rape seed in 2014 53 followed by

the sea level rise many areas are under sea level in the netherlands and are protected by dam and dikes15 the netherlands supported in 2010 raising the european union emission restrictions from 20 to 30 however the netherlands has only committed to reaching the minimum 14 goal for itself1 historical trends 1990-2011edit the main sources of renewable energy up to 2011 were from biomass and wind power solar power was marginal with only 143 mw installed capacity by 2011 energy from hydroelectric sources in 2011 was only marginally greater than that provided from heat extracted from warm milk
