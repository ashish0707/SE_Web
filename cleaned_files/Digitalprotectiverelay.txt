protective relay is a computer-based system with software-based protection algorithms for the detection of electrical faults1 such relays are also termed as microprocessor type protective relays they are functional replacements for electro-mechanical protective relays and may include many protection functions in one unit as well as providing metering communication and self-test functions contents

see also 6 references 7 external links description and definitionedit the digital protective relay is a protective relay that uses a microprocessor to analyze power system voltages currents or other process quantities for the purpose of detection of faults in an electric power system or industrial process system a digital protective relay may also be called a numeric protective relay input processingedit low voltage and low current signals ie at the secondary of a voltage transformers and current transformers are brought into a low pass filter that removes frequency content above about 13 of the sampling frequency a relay ad converter needs to sample faster than twice per cycle of the highest frequency that it is to monitor the ac signal is then sampled by the relays analog to digital converter from 4 to 64 varies by relay samples per power system cycle as a minimum magnitude of the incoming quantity commonly using fourier transform concepts rms and some form of averaging would be used in a simple relay function more advanced analysis can be used to determine phase angles power reactive power impedance waveform distortion and other complex quantities only the fundamental component is needed for most protection algorithms unless a high speed algorithm is used that uses subcycle data to monitor for fast changing issues the sampled data is then passed through a low pass filter that numerically removes the frequency content that is above the fundamental frequency of interest ie nominal system frequency and uses fourier transform algorithms to extract the fundamental frequency magnitude and angle logic processingedit the relay analyzes the resultant ad converter outputs to determine if action is required under its protection algorithms protection algorithms are a set of logic equations in part designed by the protection engineer and in part designed by the relay manufacturer the relay is capable of applying advanced logic it is capable of analyzing whether the relay should trip or restrain from tripping based on parameters set by the user compared against many functions of its analogue inputs relay contact inputs timing and order of event sequences if a fault condition is detected output contacts operate to trip the associated circuit breakers parameter settingedit the logic is user-configurable and can vary from simply changing front panel switches or moving of circuit board jumpers to accessing the relays internal parameter setting webpage via communications link on another computer hundreds of kilometres away the relay may have an extensive collection of settings beyond what can be entered via front panel knobs and dials and these settings are transferred to the relay via an interface with a pc personal computer and this same pc interface may be used to collect event reports from the relay event recordingedit in some relays a short history of the entire sampled data is kept for oscillographic records the event recording would include some means for the user to see the timing of key logic decisions relay io inputoutput changes and see in an oscillographic fashion at least the fundamental component of the incoming analogue parameters data displayedit digitalnumerical relays provide a front panel display or display on a terminal through a communication interface this is used to display relay settings and real-time currentvoltage values etc more complex digital relays will have metering and communication protocol ports allowing the relay to become an element in a scada system communication ports may include rs232rs485 or ethernet copper or fibre-optic communication languages may include modbus dnp3 or iec61850 protocols comparison with other typesedit electromechanical protective relays at a hydroelectric generation station by contrast an electromechanical protective relay converts the voltages and currents to magnetic and electric forces and torques that press against spring tensions in the relay the tension of the spring and taps on the electromagnetic coils in the relay are the main processes by which a user sets such a relay in a solid state relay the incoming voltage and current wave-forms are monitored by analog circuits not recorded or digitized the analog values are compared to settings made by the user via potentiometers in the relay and in some case taps on transformers in some solid state relays a simple microprocessor does some of the relay logic but the logic is fixed and simple for instance in some time overcurrent solid state relays the incoming ac current is first converted into a small signal ac value then the ac is fed into a rectifier and filter that converts the ac to a dc value proportionate to the ac waveform an op-amp and comparator is used to create a dc that rises when a trip point is reached then a relatively simple microprocessor does a slow speed ad conversion of the dc signal integrates the results to create the time-overcurrent curve response and trips when the integration rises above a set-point though this relay has a microprocessor it lacks the attributes of a digitalnumeric relay and hence the term microprocessor relay is not a clear term historyedit the digitalnumeric relay was introduced in the early 1980s with areva abb groups forerunners and sel making some of the early market advances in the arena but the arena has become crowded today with many manufacturers in transmission line and generator protection by the mid-1990s the digital relay had nearly replaced the solid state and electro-mechanical relay in new construction in distribution applications the replacement by the digital relay proceeded a bit more slowly while the great majority of feeder relays in new applications today are digital the solid state relay still sees some use where simplicity of the application allows for simpler relays which allows one to avoid the complexity of digital relays protective element typesedit protective elements refer to the overall logic surrounding the electrical condition that is being monitored for instance a differential element refers to the logic required to monitor two or more currents find their difference and trip if the difference is beyond certain parameters the term element and function are quite interchangeable in many instances for simplicity on one-line diagrams the protection function is usually identified by an ansi device number in the era of electromechanical and solid state relays any one relay could implement only one or two protective functions so a complete protection system may have many relays on its panel in a digitalnumeric relay many functions are implemented by the microprocessor programming any one numeric relay may implement one or all of these functions a listing of device numbers is found at ansi device numbers a summary of some common device numbers seen in digital relays is 11 multi-function device 21 impedance 24 voltshz 25
