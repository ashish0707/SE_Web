climate-friendly gardening is gardening in ways which reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from gardens and encourage the absorption of carbon dioxide by soils and plants in order to aid the reduction of global warming1 to be a climate-friendly gardener means considering both what happens in a garden and the materials brought into it and the impact they have on land use and climate23 it can also include garden features or activities in the garden that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere45 orchard garden showing orchard trees herbaceous perennials and ground-cover plants at

gasesedit most of the excess greenhouse gases causing climate change have come from burning fossil fuel but a special report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and cement production were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change the other third has been caused by human land use6 the three main greenhouse gases produced by unsustainable land use are carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide47 black carbon or soot can also be caused by unsustainable land use and although not a gas can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change89 carbon dioxideedit carbon dioxide co2 is a natural part of the carbon cycle but human land uses often add more especially from habitat destruction and the cultivation of soil when woodlands wetlands and other natural habitats are turned into pasture arable fields buildings and roads the carbon held in the soil and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and methane to trap more heat in the atmosphere6 gardeners may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways using peat or potting compost containing peat14101112 buying garden furniture or other wooden products made from woodland which has been destroyed rather than taken as a renewable crop from sustainably managed woodland2 digging soil and leaving it bare so that

ch4 is a natural part of the carbon cycle but human land uses often add more especially from anaerobic soil artificial wetlands such as rice fields and from the guts of farm animals especially ruminants such as cattle and sheep20 gardeners may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways compacting soil so that it becomes anaerobic for example by treading on soil when it is wet allowing compost heaps to become compacted and anaerobic421 creating homemade liquid feed by putting the leaves of plants such as comfrey under water with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay killing pernicious weeds by covering them with water with the unintended consequence that the plants may release methane as they decay allowing ponds to become anaerobic for example by adding unsuitable fish species which stir up sediment that then blocks light from and kills submerged oxygenating plants22 nitrous oxideedit nitrous oxide n2o is a natural part of the nitrogen cycle but human land uses often add more2324 gardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by using synthetic nitrogen fertilizer for example weed and feed on lawns especially if it is applied when plants are not actively growing the soil is compacted or when other factors are limiting so that the plants cannot make use of the nitrogen182526 compacting the soil for example by working in the garden when the soil is wet which will increase the conversion of nitrates to nitrous oxide by soil bacteria25 burning garden waste on bonfires black carbonedit black carbon is not a gas but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be suspended in the atmosphere and absorb heat89 gardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden prunings and weeds on bonfires especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot5 gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel especially the diesel used in most lorries gardening to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and absorb carbon dioxideedit there are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere124122527 climate-friendly

botanic garden climate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect carbon stores beyond gardens the biggest carbon stores in land are in soil the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are woods and wetlands and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats according to morison and morecroftedss plant growth and climate change28 the net primary productivity the net amount of carbon absorbed each year of various habitats is tropical forests

density- 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare- is temperate moist forest of eucalyptus regnans in the central highlands of south-east australia and in general that temperate forests contain more carbon than either boreal forests or tropical forests29 carbon stores in britainedit according to milne and browns 1997 paper carbon in the vegetation and soils of great britain30 britains vegetation and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon of which almost all is in the soil and most in scottish peatland soil soils in scotland 6948 million tonnes carbon soils in england and wales 2890 million tonnes carbon vegetation in british woods and plantations which cover only 11 of britains land area 91 million tonnes carbon other vegetation 23 million tonnes carbon a 2005 report31 suggested that british woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare many studies of soil carbon only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres but soil is often much deeper than that especially below woodland one 2009 study of the united kingdoms carbon stores by keith dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100cm below the habitats including forestland cropland and grassland covered by the kyoto protocol reporting requirements32 forestland soils average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 160 england 428 scotland 203 wales and 366 northern ireland grassland soils average figures in tonnes carbon per hectare are 148 england 386 scotland 171 wales and 304 northern ireland cropland soils average figures in tonnes carbon per

garden at wisley a ground-cover and rain-garden plant - symphytum grandiflorum creeping comfrey with cotinus coggygria climate-friendly gardeners choose peat-free composts1412 because some of the planets biggest carbon stores are in soil and especially in the peatland soil of wetlands the intergovernmental panel on climate changes special report land use land-use change and forestry gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere6 climate-friendly gardeners also avoid using tapwater not only because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water1 but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to carbon dioxide6 a climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large irrigated lawns but instead includes water-butts to collect rainwater water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established trees shrubs and hedges to shelter gardens from the drying effects of sun and wind and groundcover plants and organic mulch to protect the soil and keep it moist245p24212p808233 climate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores are permeable12 and may also make rain gardens sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed so that the rain can then be fed back into groundwater rather than going into storm drains the plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils234 protecting carbon stores in woodlandedit wetlands may store the most carbon in their soils but woods store more carbon in their living biomass than any other type of vegetation and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands6 climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy such as garden furniture have been made of wood from sustainably managed woodland protecting and increasing carbon stores in gardensedit juglans elaeopyren an american walnut at cambridge botanic garden after rocks containing carbonate compounds soil is the biggest store of carbon on land6 carbon is found in soil organic matter including living organisms plant roots fungi animals protists bacteria dead organisms and humus4 one study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86 of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil35 wild strawberries in flower below a british hedge the first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are therefore to protect the soils existing carbon stores increase the soils carbon stores to protect the soil climate-friendly gardens are based on plants rather than buildings and paving1335 have soil that is kept at a relatively stable temperature by shelter from trees shrubs andor hedges36 have soil that is always kept covered and therefore moist and at a relatively stable temperature by groundcover plants fast-growing green manures which can be used as an intercrop in kitchen gardens of annual vegetables andor organic mulches13637 mulch of woodchips protecting soil at the royal horticultural society garden at wisley in surrey climate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil they do not tread on the soil when it is wet because it is then most vulnerable to compaction they dig as little is possible and only when the soil is moist rather than wet because cultivation increases the oxidation of soil organic matter and produces carbon dioxide212p5455353638 to increase soil carbon stores climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants and other garden organisms above and below ground and reduce the impact of any limiting factors in general the more biomass that the plants can create each year the more carbon will be added to the soil12p545537 however only some biomass each year becomes long-term soil carbon or humus in soil carbon and organic farming a 2009 report for the soil association gundula azeez discusses several factors which increase how much biomass is turned into humus these include good soil structure soil organisms such as fine root hairs microorganisms mycorrhizas and earthworms which increase soil aggregation residues from plants such as trees and shrubs which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as lignin and plant residues with a carbon to nitrogen ratio lower than about 321.39 nitrogen-fixing nodules on wisteria roots hazelnut for scale climate-friendly gardens therefore include hedges for shelter from wind3637 a light canopy of late-leafing deciduous trees to let in enough sunlight for growth but not so much that the garden becomes too hot and dry37 this is one of the principles behind many agroforestry systems such as paulownias use in china partly because it is late-leafing and its canopy is sparse so that crops below it get shelter but also enough light40 groundcover plants and organic mulches such as woodchips over compost made from kitchen and garden waste to keep soil moist and at relatively stable temperatures3637 nitrogen-fixing plants because soil nitrogen may be a limiting factor but climate-friendly gardeners avoid synthetic nitrogen fertilizers because these may cause mycorrhizal associations to break down37 many layers37 of plants including woody plants such as trees12 and shrubs other perennials groundcover plants deep-rooted plants all chosen according to right plant right place4142 so that they are suited to their growing conditions and will grow well a wide diversity of disease-resistant vigorous plants for resilience and to make the most of all available ecological niches3537 plants to feed and shelter wildlife to increase total biomass and to ensure biological control of pests and diseases121343 compost made from garden and kitchen waste12 lawns like other grasslands can build up good levels of soil carbon39 but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides grasses they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as clover4 and if they are cut using a mulching mower which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn more carbon however may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees12 and shrubs they also do not need to be maintained using power tools climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible they will therefore avoid pesticides12 and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens reducing greenhouse gas emissionsedit climate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere using gardens to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsedit climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gases elsewhere for example by using the sun and wind to dry washing on washing lines in the garden instead of using electricity generated by fossil fuel to dry washing in tumble dryers from farmlandedit walnut juglans regia with ripening walnuts food is a major contributor to climate change in the united kingdom according to tara garnett of the food food climate research network food contributes 19 of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions44 soil is the biggest store of carbon on land it is therefore important to protect the soil organic matter in farmland farm animals however especially free-range pigs may cause erosion and cultivation of the soil increases the oxidation of soil organic matter into carbon dioxide38 other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by farm animals can make soil anaerobic and produce methane farm animals produce methane and nitrogen fertilizers can be converted to nitrous oxide most farmland consists of fields growing annual arable crops which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals and grassland used as pasture hay or silage to feed farm animals some perennial food plants are also grown such as fruits and nuts in orchards and watercress grown in water although all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others root crops such as potatoes and sugar-beet and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as green vegetables and salads are considered high risk in catchment-sensitive farming4546 climate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food12 and may choose food crops which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland soils if they grow such high-risk crops in small vegetable plots in their gardens where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under commercial pressures climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet cicely which sweeten food and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet47 they may also choose to grow perennial food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens37474849 grassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields but farm animals especially ruminants such as cattle or sheep produce large amounts of methane directly and from manure heaps and slurry20 slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide2650 gardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less meat and dairy produce by growing nut trees which are a good source of tasty protein-rich food including walnuts which are an excellent source of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid51 researchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable such as agroforestry forest farming wildlife-friendly farming soil management catchment-sensitive farming or water-friendly farming52 for example the organisation farming futures assists farmers in the united kingdom to reduce their farms greenhouse gas emissions53 farmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for green credentials gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers1 from industryedit nitrogen-fixing and edible - elaeagnus umbellatus at the agroforestry research trust forest garden in devon climate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general12 in particular they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them1 instead gardeners can garden using only rainwater233 greenhouse gases are produced in the manufacture of many materials and products used by gardeners for example it takes a lot of energy to produce synthetic fertilizers especially nitrogen fertilizers ammonium nitrate for example has an embodied energy of 67000 kilojouleskilogramme2 so climate-friendly gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as nitrogen-fixing plants climate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow cradle-to-cradle design and circular economy principles when they choose to buy or make something it should be possible to take it apart again and recycle or compost every part so that there is no waste only raw materials to be made into something else54 this will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when extracting raw materials from transportedit gardeners can reduce not only their food miles by growing some of their own food but also their gardening miles by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible this might include ordering plants by mail order from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out bare-root reducing transport demand and the use of peat-based composts or growing plants from seed which will also increase genetic diversity and therefore resilience or growing plants vegetatively from cuttings or offsets from other local gardeners or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms12 from housesedit climbers as insulation - boston ivy parthenocissus tricuspidata boston ivy in autumn climate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by using sunlight and wind to dry washing on washing lines instead of fossil fuel-generated electricity to run tumble dryers planting deciduous climbers on houses and planting deciduous trees at suitable distances from the house to provide shade during the summer reducing the consumption of electricity for air conditioning but also such that at cooler times of year sunlight can reach and warm a house reducing heating costs and consumption535 planting hedges trees shrubs and climbers to shelter houses from wind reducing heating costs and consumption during the winter as long as any planting does not create a wind-tunnel effect5p24335 climate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating carminative plants such as fennel and garlic which reduce intestinal gases such as methane55 reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gardensedit slow-growing yew taxus baccata as hedge at charles darwins home down house kent nitrogen-fixing red and white clover trifolium as lawn plants leaf cage compost heap and wormery at the royal horticultural society garden at wisley there are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent power tools which are powered by diesel or petrol or electricity generated by burning other fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use hand tools rather than power tools or power tools powered by renewable electricity12 or design their gardens to reduce or remove a need to use power tools for example they may choose dense slow-growing species for hedges so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year13 lawns need to be cut by lawn mowers and in drier parts of the world are often irrigated by tapwater climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by replacing part of or all lawns with other perennial planting such as trees and shrubs with less ecologically demanding maintenance requirements cut some or all lawns only once or twice a year ie convert them into meadows make lawn shapes simple so that they may be cut quickly increase the cutting height of mower blades use a mulching mower to return organic matter to the soil sow clover to increase vigour without the need for synthetic fertilisers and resilience in dry periods cut lawns with electric mowers using electricity from renewable energy cut lawns with hand tools such as push mowers or scythes141236 greenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by choosing only annual plants which will only be in the greenhouse during warmer months or perennial plants which do not need any extra heat during winter using water tanks as heat stores and compost heaps as heat sources inside greenhouses so that they stay frost-free in winter climate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon5 but instead burn them indoors in a wood-burning stove and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel or cut them up to use as mulch and increase soil carbon stores12 or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them aerated reducing methane emissions56 to reduce the risk of fire they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to wildfires and which do not catch fire easily rather than fire-adapted plants from fire-prone habitats which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as comfrey to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed because the rotting leaves in the anaerobic conditions under water may emit methane nitrogen fertilizers may be oxidised to nitrous oxide12 especially if fertilizer is applied in excess or when plants are not actively growing climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use nitrogen-fixing plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions see alsoedit agroforestry energy-efficient landscaping foodscaping forest gardening green building list of organic gardening
