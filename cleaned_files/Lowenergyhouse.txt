examples general usageedit the meaning of the term low-energy house has changed over time but in europe it generally refers to a house that uses around half of the german or swiss low-energy standards referred to below for space heating typically in the range from 30 kwhma to 20 kwhma 9,500 btuftyr to 6,300 btuftyr below this the term ultra-low-energy building is often used the term can also refer to any dwelling whose energy use is below the standards demanded by current building codes because national standards vary considerably around the world low-energy developments in one country may not meet normal practice in another national standardsedit in some countries the term relates to a specific building standard1 in particular these seek to limit the energy used for space heating since in many climate zones it represents the largest energy use other energy use may also be regulated the history of passive solar building design gives an international look at one form of low-energy building development and standards europeedit in germany a low-energy house niedrigenergiehaus has a limit equivalent to 7 litres of heating oil for each square metre of room for space heating annually 50 kwhma or 15,850 btuftyr in switzerland the term is used in connection with the minergie standard 42 kwhma or 13,300btuftyr or the minergie-p equivalent to the passivhaus in comparison the german passivhaus ultra-low-energy standard currently undergoing adoption in some other european countries has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kwhma or 4,755btuftyr a sub-10 passive house is under construction in ireland that has an independently evaluated phpp passive house rating of 9.5kwm2year its form of construction also tackles the issue of embodied energy which can significantly distort the lifecycle co2 emissions associated with even low energy use houses north americaedit in the united states the energy star program is the largest program defining low-energy homes and consumer products homes earning energy star certification use at least 15 less energy than standard new homes built to the international residential code although homes typically achieve 2030 savings2 in addition the us department of energy launched a program in 2008 with the goal of spreading zero-energy housing over the us currently participating builders commit to constructing new homes that achieve 30 savings on a home energy rating scale3 zero-energy and energy-plus buildingsedit beyond ultra-low-energy buildings are those that use on average over the course of a year no imported energy - zero-energy buildings or even those that generate a surplus - energy-plus houses both of which have been and are being successfully built this can be achieved by a mixture of energy conservation technologies and the use of renewable energy sources however in the absence of recognized standards the mix between these and consequently the energy-use profile and environmental impact of the building can vary significantly at one end of the spectrum are buildings with an ultra-low space heating requirement that therefore require low levels of imported energy even in winter approaching the concept of an autonomous building at the opposite end of the spectrum are buildings where few attempts are made to reduce the space heating requirement and which therefore use high levels of imported energy in winter while this can be balanced by high levels of renewable energy generation throughout the year it imposes greater demands on the traditional national energy infrastructure during the peak winter season zero-energy building superinsulation plusenergy low-energy technologyedit introductionedit main article list of low-energy building techniques for history and further detail see zero energy building and passivhaus low-energy buildings typically use high levels of insulation energy efficient windows low levels of air infiltration and heat recovery ventilation to lower heating and cooling energy they may also use passive solar building design techniques or active solar technologies these homes may use hot water heat recycling technologies to recover heat from showers and dishwashers lighting and miscellaneous energy use is allieviated with fluorescent lighting and efficient appliances weatherization provides more information on increasing building energy efficiency passive houses are required to achieve a whole building air change rate of no more than 0.6 achr 4 footnote 1 under forced pressurisation and depressurisation testing at 50pa minimum on site blower door testing by certified testers is used to prove compliance a significant feature of ultra-low-energy buildings is the increasing importance of heat loss through linear thermal bridging within the construction failure to eliminate thermal pathways from warm to cold surfaces bridges creates the conditions for interstitial condensation forming deep within the construction and lead to potentially serious issues of mould growth and rot with near zero filtration losses through the fabric of the dwelling air movement cannot be relied upon to dry out the construction and a comprehensive condensation risk analysis of every abutment detail is recommended improvements to heating cooling ventilation and water heatingedit absorption refrigerator annualized geothermal solar earth cooling tubes geothermal heat pump heat recovery ventilation hot water heat recycling passive cooling renewable heat seasonal thermal energy storage stes solar air conditioning solar hot water solar devices passive solar design and landscapeedit passive solar building design and energy-efficient landscaping support the low-energy house in conservation and can integrate them into a neighborhood and environment following passive solar building techniques where possible buildings are compact in shape to reduce their surface area with principal windows oriented towards the equator -
