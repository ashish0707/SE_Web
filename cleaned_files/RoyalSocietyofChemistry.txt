eccc and can award this designation to chartered chemists mchema mastership in chemical analysis the rsc awards this postgraduate qualification which is the uk statutory qualification for practice as a public analyst17 it requires candidates to submit a portfolio of suitable experience and to take theory papers and a one-day laboratory practical examination18 grscedit the qualification grsc graduate of the royal society of chemistry was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to a chemistry degree and overseen by the rsc19 it replaced the gric offered by the royal institute of chemistry divisionsedit the society is organised around 9 divisions based on subject areas and local sections both in the united kingdom and overseas divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas analytical division for analytical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the society for analytical chemistry 12 subject groups dalton division named after john dalton for inorganic chemistry 6 subject groups education division for chemical education 4 subject groups faraday division named after michael faraday for physical chemistry and promoting the original aims of the faraday society 14 subject groups organic division for organic chemistry 6 subject groups chemical biology interface division 2 subject groups environment sustainability and energy division 3 subject groups materials chemistry division 4 subject groups industry and technology division 13 subject groups there are 12 subjects

chemistry such as a history of the faraday society subscriptions to the journals are available individually or all-in under a provision called rsc gold21 burlington houseedit burlington house established 2010 location piccadilly london w1 england website wwwrscorg the london offices of the society are in burlington house piccadilly events are hosted here for the public rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rscs public engagement website the reaction the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music the events have attracted notable science writers such as philip ball antony john williams and john emsley to give public lectures most of these are available as archived video streams via the rscs reaction website22 historyedit although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010 the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857 at which time it was known as the chemical society the heart of the chemistry centre is the rscs library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842 over the years the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including michael faraday the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available in november 2014 the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply royal society of chemistry at burlington house and the name chemistry centre dropped library and information centreedit the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects including online access for members housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members although the public are also welcome benevolent fundedit the staircase at the royal society of chemistry burlington house designed by the partnership of robert richardson banks and charles barry jr the royal society of chemistrys benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times through advice and guidance financial support and volunteer support23 it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry later the royal institute of chemistry established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war it had an aim to help necessitous persons who are or have been fellows or associates of the institute their wives or children and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates through voluntary contributions from members the benevolent funds ethos of members helping members stems from the institute of chemistrys council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed24 in 1960 the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system where members were asked to visit applicants beneficiaries elderly and housebound members in their area each local section was also appointed a fund representative25 a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004 forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families26 the benevolent fund committee formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months27 prizes and awardsedit main article list of royal society of chemistry medals and awards the rsc awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemists career28 medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups the centrally awarded medals include the harrison-meldola memorial prizes which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry29 and the corday-morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry including computer simulation30 the tilden prize previously known as the tilden lecture consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize known as the meldola medal and prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize include christopher kelk ingold 1921 1922 cyril norman hinshelwood
