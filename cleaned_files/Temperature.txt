waterston bookthermodynamics v t e body temperature variation annual mean temperature around the world a temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold it is measured by a thermometer several scales and units exist for measuring temperature the most common being celsius denoted c formerly called centigrade fahrenheit denoted f and especially in science kelvin denoted k the coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero at which the thermal motion of atoms and molecules reaches its minimum classically this would be a state of motionlessness but quantum uncertainty dictates that the particles still possess a finite zero-point energy absolute zero is denoted as 0k on the kelvin scale 273.15c on the celsius scale and 459.67f on the fahrenheit scale the kinetic theory offers a valuable but limited account of the behavior of the materials of macroscopic bodies especially of fluids it indicates the absolute temperature as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of those of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons atoms and molecules that move freely within the material thermal vibration of a segment

temperature scales differ in two ways the point chosen as zero degrees and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale the celsius scale c is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world it is an empirical scale it developed by a historical progress which led to its zero point 0c being defined by the freezing point of water with additional degrees defined so that 100c was the boiling point of water both at sea-level atmospheric pressure because of the 100 degree interval it is called a centigrade scale1 since the standardization of the kelvin in the international system of units it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the kelvin scale and so that a temperature increment of one degree celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15 the united states commonly uses the fahrenheit scale on which water freezes at 32f and boils at 212f at sea-level atmospheric pressure many scientific measurements use the kelvin temperature scale unit symbol k named in honor of the scottish physicist who first defined it it is a thermodynamic or absolute temperature scale its zero point 0k is defined to coincide with the coldest physically-possible temperature called absolute zero its degrees are defined through thermodynamics the temperature of absolute zero occurs at 0k 273.15c or 459.67f and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at 273.15k 0c the international system of units si defines a scale and unit for the kelvin or thermodynamic temperature by using the reliably reproducible temperature of the triple point of water as a second reference point the first reference point being 0k at absolute zero the triple point is a singular state with its own unique and invariant temperature and pressure along with for a fixed mass of water in a vessel of fixed volume an autonomically and stably self-determining partition into three mutually contacting phases vapour liquid and solid dynamically depending only on the total internal energy of the mass of water for historical reasons the triple point temperature of water is fixed at 273.16 units of the measurement increment thermodynamic approach to temperatureedit temperature is one of the principal quantities in the study of thermodynamics kinds of temperature scaleedit there is a variety of kinds of temperature scale it may be convenient to classify them as empirically and theoretically based empirical temperature scales are historically older while theoretically based scales arose in the middle of the nineteenth century23 empirically based scalesedit empirically based temperature scales rely directly on measurements of simple physical properties of materials for example the length of a column of mercury confined in a glass-walled capillary tube is dependent largely on temperature and is the basis of the very useful mercury-in-glass thermometer such scales are valid only within convenient ranges of temperature for example above the boiling point of mercury a mercury-in-glass thermometer is impracticable most materials expand with temperature increase but some materials such as water contract with temperature increase over some specific range and then they are hardly useful as thermometric materials a material is of no use as a thermometer near one of its phase-change temperatures for example its boiling-point in spite of these restrictions most generally used practical thermometers are of the empirically based kind especially it was used for calorimetry which contributed greatly to the discovery of thermodynamics nevertheless empirical thermometry has serious drawbacks when judged as a basis for theoretical physics empirically based thermometers beyond their base as simple direct measurements of ordinary physical properties of thermometric materials can be re-calibrated by use of theoretical physical reasoning and this can extend their range of adequacy theoretically based scalesedit theoretically based temperature scales are based directly on theoretical arguments especially those of thermodynamics of kinetic theory and of quantum mechanics they rely on theoretical properties of idealized devices and materials they are more or less comparable with practically feasible physical devices and materials theoretically based temperature scales are used to provide calibrating standards for practical empirically based thermometers the accepted fundamental thermodynamic temperature scale is the kelvin scale based on an ideal cyclic process envisaged for a carnot heat engine an ideal material on which a temperature scale can be based is the ideal gas the pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges that they can be used for thermometry this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today45 the ideal gas thermometer is however not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics this is because the entropy of an ideal gas at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics the physical reason is that the ideal gas law exactly read refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure678 measurement of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional black body can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum spectral radiance of black-body radiation is directly proportional to the temperature of the black body this is known as wiens displacement law and has a theoretical explanation in plancks law and the boseeinstein law measurement of the spectrum of noise-power produced by an electrical resistor can also provide an accurate temperature measurement the resistor has two terminals and is in effect a one-dimensional body the bose-einstein law for this case indicates that the noise-power is directly proportional to the temperature of the resistor and to the value of its resistance and to the noise band-width in a given frequency band the noise-power has equal contributions from every frequency and is called johnson noise if the value of the resistance is known then the temperature can be found910 if molecules or atoms or electrons1112 are emitted from a material and their velocities are measured the spectrum of their velocities often nearly obeys a theoretical law called the maxwellboltzmann distribution which gives a well-founded measurement of temperatures for which the law holds13 there have not yet been successful experiments of this same kind that directly use the fermidirac distribution for thermometry but perhaps that will be achieved in future14 absolute thermodynamic scaleedit the kelvin scale is called absolute for two reasons one is kelvins that its formal character is independent of the properties of particular materials the other reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter so that they have a limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature according to the third law of thermodynamics nevertheless a kelvin temperature has a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition this numerical value also depends on the properties of water which has a gasliquidsolid triple point that can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon the choice of this triple point is also arbitrary and by convention the kelvin scale is also called the thermodynamic scale definition of the kelvin scaleedit the thermodynamic definition of temperature is due to kelvin it is framed in terms of an idealized device called a carnot engine imagined to define a continuous cycle of states of its working body the cycle is imagined to run so slowly that at each point of the cycle the working body is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium there are four limbs in such a carnot cycle the engine consists of four bodies the main one is called the working body two of them are called heat reservoirs so large that their respective non-deformation variables are not changed by transfer of energy as heat through a wall permeable only to heat to the working body the fourth body is able to exchange energy with the working body only through adiabatic work it may be called the work reservoir the substances and states of the two heat reservoirs should be chosen so that they are not in thermal equilibrium with one another this means that they must be at different fixed temperatures one labeled here with the number 1 hotter than the other labeled here with the number 2 this can be tested by connecting the heat reservoirs successively to an auxiliary empirical thermometric body that starts each time at a convenient fixed intermediate temperature the thermometric body should be composed of a material that has a strictly monotonic relation between its chosen empirical thermometric variable and the amount of adiabatic isochoric work done on it in order to settle the structure and sense of operation of the carnot cycle it is convenient to use such a material also for the working body because most materials are of this kind this is hardly a restriction of the generality of this definition the carnot cycle is considered to start from an initial condition of the working body that was reached by the completion of a reversible adiabatic compression from there the working body is initially connected by a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir number 1 so that during the first limb of the cycle it expands and does work on the work reservoir the second limb of the cycle sees the working body expand adiabatically and reversibly with no energy exchanged as heat but more energy being transferred as work to the work reservoir the third limb of the cycle sees the working body connected through a wall permeable only to heat to the heat reservoir 2 contracting and accepting energy as work from the work reservoir the cycle is closed by reversible adiabatic compression of the working body with no energy transferred as heat but energy being transferred to it as work from the work reservoir with this set-up the four limbs of the reversible carnot cycle are characterized by amounts of energy transferred as work from the working body to the work reservoir and as heat from the heat reservoirs to the working body the amounts of energy transferred as heat from the heat reservoirs are measured through the changes in the non-deformation variable of the working body with reference to the previously known properties of that body the amounts of work done on the work reservoir and the first law of thermodynamics the amounts of energy transferred as heat respectively from reservoir 1 and from reservoir 2 may then be denoted respectively q1 and q2 then the absolute or thermodynamic temperatures t1 and t2 of the reservoirs are defined so that to be such that t 1 t 2 q 1 q 2  1 displaystyle t_1t_2-q_1q_21 kelvins original work postulating absolute temperature was published in 1848 it was based on the work of carnot before the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics kelvin wrote in his 1848 paper that his scale was absolute in the sense that it was defined independently of the properties of any particular kind of matter his definitive publication which sets out the definition just stated was printed in 1853 a paper read in 1851.15161718 this definition rests on the physical assumption that there are readily available walls permeable only to heat in his detailed definition of a wall permeable only to heat carathodory includes several ideas the non-deformation state variable of a closed system is represented as a real number a state of thermal equilibrium between two closed systems connected by a wall permeable only to heat means that a certain mathematical relation holds between the state variables including the respective non-deformation variables of those two systems that particular mathematical relation is regarded by buchdahl as a preferred statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics19 also referring to thermal contact equilibrium whenever each of the systems s1 and s2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system s3 under identical conditions the systems s1 and s2 are in mutual equilibrium20 it may be viewed as a re-statement of the principle stated by maxwell in the words all heat is of the same kind21 this physical idea is also expressed by bailyn as a possible version of the zeroth law of thermodynamics all diathermal walls are equivalent22 thus the present definition of thermodynamic temperature rests on the zeroth law of thermodynamics explicitly this present definition of thermodynamic temperature also rests on the first law of thermodynamics for the determination of amounts of energy transferred as heat implicitly for this definition the second law of thermodynamics provides information that establishes the virtuous character of the temperature so defined it provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition will lead to the same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures which in this sense is universal or absolute the second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another and the cycle can be imagined to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir numerical details are settled by making one of the heat reservoirs a cell at the triple point of water which is defined to have an absolute temperature of 273.16 k23 the zeroth law of thermodynamics allows this definition to be used to measure the absolute or thermodynamic temperature of an arbitrary body of interest by making the other heat reservoir have the same temperature as the body of interest temperature as an intensive variableedit in thermodynamic terms temperature is an intensive variable because it is equal to a differential coefficient of one extensive variable with respect to another for a given body it thus has the dimensions of a ratio of two extensive variables in thermodynamics two bodies are often considered as connected by contact with a common wall which has some specific permeability properties such specific permeability can be referred to a specific intensive variable an example is a diathermic wall that is permeable only to heat the intensive variable for this case is temperature when the two bodies have been in contact for a very long time and have settled to a permanent steady state the relevant intensive variables are equal in the two bodies for a diathermal wall this statement is sometimes called the zeroth law of thermodynamics242526 in particular when the body is described by stating its internal energy u an extensive variable as a function of its entropy s also an extensive variable and other state variables v n with u u s v n then the temperature is equal to the partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to the entropy t u s v  n  2 displaystyle tleftfrac partial upartial sright_vn2 252627 likewise when the body is described by stating its entropy s as a function of its internal energy u and other state variables v n with s s u v n then the reciprocal of the temperature is equal to the partial derivative of the entropy with respect to the internal energy 1 t s u v  n  3 displaystyle frac 1tleftfrac partial spartial uright_vn3 252728 the above definition equation 1 of the absolute temperature is due to kelvin it refers to systems closed to transfer of matter and has special emphasis on directly experimental procedures a presentation of thermodynamics by gibbs starts at a more abstract level and deals with systems open to the transfer of matter in this development of thermodynamics the equations 2 and 3 above are actually alternative definitions of temperature29 temperature local when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevailsedit real world bodies are often not in thermodynamic equilibrium and not homogeneous for study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics a body is usually spatially and temporally divided conceptually into cells of small size if classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a cell then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it if this is so for every cell of the body then local thermodynamic equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the body3031323334 it makes good sense for example to say of the extensive variable u or of the extensive variable s that it has a density per unit volume or a quantity per unit mass of the system but it makes no sense to speak of density of temperature per unit volume or quantity of temperature per unit mass of the system on the other hand it makes no sense to speak of the internal energy at a point while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point consequently temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium thus when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails in a body temperature can be regarded as a spatially varying local property in that body and this is because temperature is an intensive variable kinetic theory approach to temperatureedit a more thorough account of this is below at theoretical foundation kinetic theory provides a microscopic explanation of temperature based on macroscopic systems being composed of many microscopic particles such as molecules and ions of various species the particles of a species being all alike it explains macroscopic phenomena through the classical mechanics of the microscopic particles the equipartition theorem of kinetic theory asserts that each classical degree of freedom of a freely moving particle has an average kinetic energy of kbt2 where kb denotes boltzmanns constant the translational motion of the particle has three degrees of freedom so that except at very low temperatures where quantum effects predominate the average translational kinetic energy of a freely moving particle in a system with temperature t will be 3kbt2 it is possible to measure the average kinetic energy of constituent microscopic particles if they are allowed to escape from the bulk of the system the spectrum of velocities has to be measured and the average calculated from that it is not necessarily the case that the particles that escape and are measured have the same velocity distribution as the particles that remain in the bulk of the system but sometimes a good sample is possible molecules such as oxygen o2 have more degrees of freedom than single spherical atoms they undergo rotational and vibrational motions as well as translations heating results in an increase in temperature due to an increase in the average translational kinetic energy of the molecules heating will also cause through equipartitioning the energy associated with vibrational and rotational modes to increase thus a diatomic gas will require more energy input to increase its temperature by a certain amount ie it will have a greater heat capacity than a monatomic gas the process of cooling involves removing internal energy from a system when no more energy can be removed the system is at absolute zero though this cannot be achieved experimentally absolute zero is the null point of the thermodynamic temperature scale also called absolute temperature if it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero all classical motion of its particles would cease and they would be at complete rest in this classical sense microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics however matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero because of the uncertainty principle basic theoryedit temperature is a measure of a quality of a state of a material35 the quality may be regarded as a more abstract entity than any particular temperature scale that measures it and is called hotness by some writers36 the quality of hotness refers to the state of material only in a particular locality and in general apart from bodies held in a steady state of thermodynamic equilibrium hotness varies from place to place it is not necessarily the case that a material in a particular place is in a state that is steady and nearly homogeneous enough to allow it to have a well-defined hotness or temperature hotness may be represented abstractly as a one-dimensional manifold every valid temperature scale has its own one-to-one map into the hotness manifold3738 when two systems in thermal contact are at the same temperature no heat transfers between them when a temperature difference does exist heat flows spontaneously from the warmer system to the colder system until they are in thermal equilibrium heat transfer occurs by conduction or by thermal radiation3940414243444546 experimental physicists for example galileo and newton47 found that there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales nevertheless the zeroth law of thermodynamics says that they all measure the same quality temperature for bodies in thermodynamic equilibriumedit for experimental physics hotness means that when comparing any two given bodies in their respective separate thermodynamic equilibria any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies or that they have the same temperature48 this does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic4950 a definite sense of greater hotness can be had independently of calorimetry of thermodynamics and of properties of particular materials from wiens displacement law of thermal radiation the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional by a universal constant to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum this frequency is always positive but can have values that tend to zero thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium these physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold this is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium237385152 except for a system undergoing a first-order phase change such as the melting of ice as a closed system receives heat without change in its volume and without change in external force fields acting on it its temperature rises for a system undergoing such a phase change so slowly that departure from thermodynamic equilibrium can be neglected its temperature remains constant as the system is supplied with latent heat conversely a loss of heat from a closed system without phase change without change of volume and without change in external force fields acting on it decreases its temperature53 temperature for bodies in a steady state but not in thermodynamic equilibriumedit while for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium states the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that they are at the same temperature this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium it can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter and if this is so then at least one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature nevertheless any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical non-absolute hotness and temperature for a suitable range of processes this is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics temperature for bodies not in a steady stateedit when a body is not in a steady state then the notion of temperature becomes even less safe than for a body in a steady state not in thermodynamic equilibrium this is also a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics thermodynamic equilibrium axiomaticsedit for axiomatic treatment of thermodynamic equilibrium since the 1930s it has become customary to refer to a zeroth law of thermodynamics the customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium should be said to have the same temperature by definition but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale a more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold375254 while the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred absolute temperature unique up to an arbitrary scale factor whence called the thermodynamic temperature23755565758 if internal energy is considered as a function of the volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume its natural intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system heat capacityedit see also heat capacity and calorimetry when an energy transfer to or from a body is only as heat state of the body changes depending on the surroundings and the walls separating them from the body various changes are possible in the body they include chemical reactions increase of pressure increase of temperature and phase change for each kind of change under specified conditions the heat capacity is the ratio of the quantity of heat transferred to the magnitude of the change for example if the change is an increase in temperature at constant volume with no phase change and no chemical change then the temperature of the body rises and its pressure increases the quantity of heat transferred q divided by the observed temperature change t is the bodys heat capacity at constant volume cv c v q t displaystyle c_vfrac delta qdelta t if heat capacity is measured for a well defined amount of substance the specific heat is the measure of the heat required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature for example to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin equal to one degree celsius requires 4186 joules per kilogram jkg temperature measurementedit a typical celsius thermometer measures a winter day temperature of 17c see also timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology international temperature scale of 1990 and comparison of temperature scales temperature measurement using modern scientific thermometers and temperature scales goes back at least as far as the early 18th century when gabriel fahrenheit adapted a thermometer switching to mercury and a scale both developed by ole christensen rmer fahrenheits scale is still in use in the united states for non-scientific applications temperature is measured with thermometers that may be calibrated to a variety of temperature scales in most of the world except for belize myanmar liberia and the united states the celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes most scientists measure temperature using the celsius scale and thermodynamic temperature using the kelvin scale which is the celsius scale offset so that its null point is 0k 273.15c or absolute zero many engineering fields in the us notably high-tech and us federal specifications civil and military also use the kelvin and celsius scales other engineering fields in the us also rely upon the rankine scale a shifted fahrenheit scale when working in thermodynamic-related disciplines such as combustion unitsedit the basic unit of temperature in the international system of units si is the kelvin it has the symbol k for everyday applications it is often convenient to use the celsius scale in which 0c corresponds very closely to the freezing point of water and 100c is its boiling point at sea level because liquid droplets commonly exist in clouds at sub-zero temperatures 0c is better defined as the melting point of ice in this scale a temperature difference of 1 degree celsius is the same as a 1kelvin increment but the scale is offset by the temperature at which ice melts 273.15 k by international agreement59 the kelvin and celsius scales are defined by two fixing points absolute zero and the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water which is water specially prepared with a specified blend of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes absolute zero is defined as precisely 0k and 273.15c it is the temperature at which all classical translational motion of the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest in the classical model quantum-mechanically however zero-point motion remains and has an associated energy the zero-point energy matter is in its ground state60 and contains no thermal energy the triple point of water is defined as 273.16k and 0.01c this definition serves the following purposes it fixes the magnitude of the kelvin as being precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water it establishes that one kelvin has precisely the same magnitude as one degree on the celsius scale and it establishes the difference between the null points of these scales as being 273.15k 0k 273.15c and 273.16k 0.01c in the united states the fahrenheit scale is widely used on this scale the freezing point of water corresponds to 32f and the boiling point to 212f the rankine scale still used in fields of chemical engineering in the us is an absolute scale based on the fahrenheit increment conversionedit the following table shows the temperature conversion formulas for conversions to and from the celsius scale from celsius to celsius fahrenheit fc9532 cf3259 kelvin kc27315 ck27315 rankine rc2731595 cr4916759 delisle

temperatures it is customary to express temperature as energy in units of electronvolts ev or kiloelectronvolts kev the energy which has a different dimension from temperature is then calculated as the product of the boltzmann constant and temperature e k b t displaystyle ek_bt  then 1 ev corresponds to 11605k in the study of qcd matter one routinely encounters temperatures of the order of a few hundred mev equivalent to about 1012k theoretical foundationedit see also thermodynamic temperature historically there are several scientific approaches to the explanation of temperature the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that can be measured in a laboratory the kinetic theory of gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles and a microscopic explanation based on statistical physics and quantum mechanics in addition rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature61 statistical physics provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states including both classical and quantum states in the fundamental physical description using natural units temperature may be measured directly in units of energy however in the practical systems of measurement for science technology and commerce such as the modern metric system of units the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the boltzmann constant a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy the microscopic description in statistical mechanics is based on a model that analyzes a system into its fundamental particles of matter or into a set of classical or quantum-mechanical oscillators and considers the system as a statistical ensemble of microstates as a collection of classical material particles temperature is a measure of the mean energy of motion called kinetic energy of the particles whether in solids liquids gases or plasmas the kinetic energy a concept of classical mechanics is half the mass of a particle times its speed squared in this mechanical interpretation of thermal motion the kinetic energies of material particles may reside in the velocity of the particles of their translational or vibrational motion or in the inertia of their rotational modes in monatomic perfect gases and approximately in most gases temperature is a measure of the mean particle kinetic energy it also determines the probability distribution function of the energy in condensed matter and particularly in solids this purely mechanical description is often less useful and the oscillator model provides a better description to account for quantum mechanical phenomena temperature determines the statistical occupation of the microstates of the ensemble the microscopic definition of temperature is only meaningful in the thermodynamic limit meaning for large ensembles of states or particles to fulfill the requirements of the statistical model in the context of thermodynamics the kinetic energy is also referred to as thermal energy the thermal energy may be partitioned into independent components attributed to the degrees of freedom of the particles or to the modes of oscillators in a thermodynamic system in general the number of these degrees of freedom that are available for the equipartitioning of energy depend on the temperature ie the energy region of the interactions under consideration for solids the thermal energy is associated primarily with the vibrations of its atoms or molecules about their equilibrium position in an ideal monatomic gas the kinetic energy is found exclusively in the purely translational motions of the particles in other systems vibrational and rotational motions also contribute degrees of freedom kinetic theory of gasesedit a theoretical understanding of temperature in an ideal gas can be obtained from the kinetic theory maxwell and boltzmann developed a kinetic theory that yields a fundamental understanding of temperature in gases62 this theory also explains the ideal gas law and the observed heat capacity of monatomic or noble gases636465 plots of pressure vs temperature for three different gas samples extrapolated to absolute zero the ideal gas law is based on observed empirical relationships between pressure p volume v and temperature t and was recognized long before the kinetic theory of gases was developed see boyles and charless laws the ideal gas law states66 p v n r t displaystyle pvnrt where n is the number of moles of gas and r70008314459800000008314459848j mol1 k167 is the gas constant this relationship gives us our first hint that there is an absolute zero on the temperature scale because it only holds if the temperature is measured on an absolute scale such as kelvins the ideal gas law allows one to measure temperature on this absolute scale using the gas thermometer the temperature in kelvins can be defined as the pressure in pascals of one mole of gas in a container of one cubic meter divided by the gas constant although it is not a particularly convenient device the gas thermometer provides an essential theoretical basis by which all thermometers can be calibrated as a practical matter it is not possible to use a gas thermometer to measure absolute zero temperature since the gases tend to condense into a liquid long before the temperature reaches zero it is possible however to extrapolate to absolute zero by using the ideal gas law as shown in the figure the kinetic theory assumes that pressure is caused by the force associated with individual atoms striking the walls and that all energy is translational kinetic energy using a sophisticated symmetry argument68 boltzmann deduced what is now called the maxwellboltzmann probability distribution function for the velocity of particles in an ideal gas from that probability distribution function the average kinetic energy ek per particle of a monatomic ideal gas is6469 e k 1 2 m v r m s 2 3 2 k t  displaystyle e_textkfrac 12mv_mathrm rms 2frac 32kt where the boltzmann constant k is the ideal gas constant divided by the avogadro number and vrms is the root-mean-square speed thus the ideal gas law states that internal energy is directly proportional to temperature70 this direct proportionality between temperature and internal energy is a special case of the equipartition theorem and holds only in the classical limit of an ideal gas it does not hold for most substances although it is true that temperature is a monotonic non-decreasing function of internal energy zeroth law of thermodynamicsedit main article zeroth law of thermodynamics when two otherwise isolated bodies are connected together by a rigid physical path impermeable to matter there is spontaneous transfer of energy as heat from the hotter to the colder of them eventually they reach a state of mutual thermal equilibrium in which heat transfer has ceased and the bodies respective state variables have settled to become unchanging one statement of the zeroth law of thermodynamics is that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other this statement helps to define temperature but it does not by itself complete the definition an empirical temperature is a numerical scale for the hotness of a thermodynamic system such hotness may be defined as existing on a one-dimensional manifold stretching between hot and cold sometimes the zeroth law is stated to include the existence of a unique universal hotness manifold and of numerical scales on it so as to provide a complete definition of empirical temperature54 to be suitable for empirical thermometry a material must have a monotonic relation between hotness and some easily measured state variable such as pressure or volume when all other relevant coordinates are fixed an exceptionally suitable system is the ideal gas which can provide a temperature scale that matches the absolute kelvin scale the kelvin scale is defined on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics second law of thermodynamicsedit main article second law of thermodynamics in the previous section certain properties of temperature were expressed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics it is also possible to define temperature in terms of the second law of thermodynamics which deals with entropy the second law states that any process will result in either no change or a net increase in the entropy of the universe this can be understood in terms of probability for example in a series of coin tosses a perfectly ordered system would be one in which either every toss comes up heads or every toss comes up tails this means that for a perfectly ordered set of coin tosses there is only one set of toss outcomes possible the set in which 100 of tosses come up the same on the other hand there are multiple combinations that can result in disordered or mixed systems where some fraction are heads and the rest tails a disordered system can be 90 heads and 10 tails or it could be 98 heads and 2 tails et cetera as the number of coin tosses increases the number of possible combinations corresponding to imperfectly ordered systems increases for a very large number of coin tosses the combinations to 50 heads and 50 tails dominates and obtaining an outcome significantly different from 5050 becomes extremely unlikely thus the system naturally progresses to a state of maximum disorder or entropy it has been previously stated that temperature governs the transfer of heat between two systems and it was just shown that the universe tends to progress so as to maximize entropy which is expected of any natural system thus it is expected that there is some relationship between temperature and entropy to find this relationship the relationship between heat work and temperature is first considered a heat engine is a device for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy resulting in the performance of work and analysis of the carnot heat engine provides the necessary relationships the work from a heat engine corresponds to the difference between the heat put into the system at the high temperature qh and the heat ejected at the low temperature qc the efficiency is the work divided by the heat put into the system or efficiency w c y q h q h q c q h 1 q c q h 4 displaystyle textrm efficiencyfrac w_cyq_hfrac q_h-q_cq_h1-frac q_cq_h4 where wcy is the work done per cycle the efficiency depends only on qcqh because qc and qh correspond to heat transfer at the temperatures tc and th respectively qcqh should be some function of these temperatures q c q h f t h  t c 5 displaystyle frac q_cq_hft_ht_c5 carnots theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient thus a heat engine operating between t1 and t3 must have the same efficiency as one consisting of two cycles one between t1 and t2 and the second between t2 and t3 this can only be the case if q 13 q 1 q 2 q 2 q 3 displaystyle q_13frac q_1q_2q_2q_3 which implies q 13 f t 1  t 3 f t 1  t 2 f t 2  t 3 displaystyle q_13ft_1t_3ft_1t_2ft_2t_3 since the first function is independent of t2 this temperature must cancel on the right side meaning ft1t3 is of the form gt1gt3 ie ft1t3 ft1t2ft2t3 gt1gt2 gt2gt3 gt1gt3 where g is a function of a single temperature a temperature scale can now be chosen with the property that q c q h t c t h 6 displaystyle frac q_cq_hfrac t_ct_h6 substituting equation 4 back into equation 2 gives a relationship for the efficiency in terms of temperature efficiency 1 q c q h 1 t c t h 7 displaystyle textrm efficiency1-frac q_cq_h1-frac t_ct_h7 for tc 0 k the efficiency is 100 and that efficiency becomes greater than 100 below 0 k since an efficiency greater than 100 violates the first law of thermodynamics this implies that 0 k is the minimum possible temperature in fact the lowest temperature ever obtained in a macroscopic system was 20 nk which was achieved in 1995 at nist subtracting the right hand side of equation 5 from the middle portion and rearranging gives q h t h q c t c 0 displaystyle frac q_ht_h-frac q_ct_c0 where the negative sign indicates heat ejected from the system this relationship suggests the existence of a state function s defined by d s d q r e v t 8 displaystyle dsfrac dq_mathrm rev t8 where the subscript indicates a reversible process the change of this state function around any cycle is zero as is necessary for any state function this function corresponds to the entropy of the system which was described previously rearranging equation 6 gives a new definition for temperature in terms of entropy

fundamental degrees of freedom eq10 is the defining relation of temperature eq 9 can be derived from the principles underlying the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalized temperature from single-particle statisticsedit it is possible to extend the definition of temperature even to systems of few particles like in a quantum dot the generalized temperature is obtained by considering time ensembles instead of configuration-space ensembles given in statistical mechanics in the case of thermal and particle exchange between a small system of fermions n even less than 10 with a singledouble-occupancy system the finite quantum grand canonical ensemble71 obtained under the hypothesis of ergodicity and orthodicity72 allows to express the generalized temperature from the ratio

negative temperature on the empirical temperature scales which are not referenced to absolute zero a negative temperature is one below the zero-point of the scale used for example dry ice has a sublimation temperature of 78.5c which is equivalent to 109.3f on the absolute kelvin scale however this temperature is 194.6 k on the absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature no material can have a temperature smaller than or equal to 0 k both of which are forbidden by the third law of thermodynamics temperature is basically defined for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium and in this definition on an absolute scale it is always positive in an apparent contradiction of this reliable and valid rule a so-called negative absolute temperature may be approximately defined for a component of a body that is not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium a component may have a negative approximate temperature while the rest of the components of the body have positive approximate temperatures such a non-equilibrium situation is either transient in time or is maintained by external factors that drive a flow of energy through the body of interest an example of such a component is a spin system within a body as follows in the quantum mechanical description of electron and nuclear spin systems that have a limited number of possible states and therefore a discrete upper limit of energy they can attain it is possible to obtain a negative temperature which is numerically indeed less than absolute zero however this is not the macroscopic temperature of the material but instead the temperature of only very specific degrees of freedom that are isolated from others and do not exchange energy by virtue of the equipartition theorem a negative temperature is experimentally achieved with suitable radio frequency techniques that cause a population inversion of spin states from the ground state as the energy in the system increases upon population of the upper states the entropy increases as well as the system becomes less ordered but attains a maximum value when the spins are evenly distributed among ground and excited states after which it begins to decrease once again achieving a state of higher order as the upper states begin to fill exclusively at the point of maximum entropy the temperature function shows the behavior of a singularity because the slope of the entropy function decreases to zero at first and then turns negative since temperature is the inverse of the derivative of the entropy the temperature formally goes to infinity at this point and switches to negative infinity as the slope turns negative at energies higher than this point the spin degree of freedom therefore exhibits formally a negative thermodynamic temperature as the energy increases further by continued population of the excited state the negative temperature approaches zero asymptotically74 as the energy of the system increases in the population inversion a system with a negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero but rather it has a higher energy than at positive temperature and may be said to be in fact hotter at negative temperatures when brought into contact with a system at a positive temperature energy will be transferred from the negative temperature regime to the positive temperature
