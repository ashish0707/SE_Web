in the village of kirkby mallory just off the a47 between leicester and hinckley in central england originally used for grass-track until 1955 a new basically oval hard-surfaced course was constructed for 1956 with a later extension forming a loop with a hairpin bend1 with the car circuit measuring only 1.35 miles 2.173km it is amongst the shortest permanent race circuits in the uk however chicanes introduced to reduce speeds in motorcycle events mean that the superbike circuit is now slightly longer at 1.41 miles 2.269km shorter uk circuits are lydden hill brands hatch indy circuit scotlands

garages in the pitlane historyedit origins 1950sedit motorcycle riders passing through the john cooper esses taking part in a circuit track day the estate at mallory park has many historical connections the oldest being the unique anglo-saxons defended moat which is now known as kirkby moats while a roman road passes through the estate fast forward to the 18th century when in 1762 sir cleoberry noel became viscount wentworth the title descended on the distaff side lord byron married into the wentworth family and it is said on his visits to mallory he wrote beneath the shade of the lebanon cedar tree which still stands in the grounds of kirkby hall the last occupant of kirkby hall was herbert clarkson who died in 1941 when it was sold during the second world war the circuit started life royal air force station kirkby mallory a standby landing ground slg during wwii and closed in 1947 the hall was a large house which was demolished in 1952 leaving only the stable block and the coach house which now forms the circuit offices workshops hotel pub and restaurant the estate of 300 acres was sold by auction in 1953 and was bought by a mr moult of derby who planned to have horse racing on the disused pony trotting track following the war mallory became a pony trotting circuit in the late 1940s which defined the outline of the oval track still in use today after the financial collapse of the equestrian club responsible for the circuit kirkby mallory racing association the track was hired by various motorcycle clubs for grass track motorcycle and motorcycle sidecar racing for example between september 1949 until 1954 the leicester query motorcycle club held grass track races in 1955 the estate was purchased by clive wormleighton under whose influence the present tarmac was constructed at a cost of 60,000 in 1956 upon completion of the building work a circuit test was held on 26 april when local grand prix driver bob gerard and maurice cann respectively conducted a cooper-bristol formula two car and a moto guzzi motorcycle around the track gerald managing an 81mph lap3 the very first race was held on 29 april when the leicester query club organised a motorcycle meeting a large crowd in excess of 20,000 spectators attended the grand opening event on 13 may 1956 248 riders arrived in leicestershire for this meeting which saw george salter set the first lap record at a speed of 84.08mph riding a norton bike cars first appeared at the whit monday meeting in event being organised by nottingham sports car club the first car race victory went to d rees in an austin3 a statue of lotus cars and team lotus founder colin chapman at the hairpin gate into the mallory park motor racing circuit many famous racing stars have raced at mallory over the years indeed a young john surtees raced against his father jack surtees while jack was a successfully grass track racer at mallory john went on to be only world champion on both two and four wheels3 famous competitors who have raced at mallory include john surtees who won the first race of the year in 1958 while the 1960 race saw mike hailwood win and set a new lap record of 89mph both hailwood and surtees along with jim clark and colin chapman are commemorated with statues at the front gate around this time clive wormleighton added the lakes which were formed by adding the sluice gate across the brook34 1960sedit clive wormleighton continued to run the circuit very successfully until 1962 when ownership passed to the grovewood securities in the july the previous owner remaining in a consultancy capacity until the end of september before this on 11 june 1962 mallory park saw it first non-championship formula one international 2000 guineas race won by john surtees aboard a lola mk4 from the privately entered lotuses of jack brabham and graham hill surtees was now a major race winner at mallory on both 2 and 4 wheels3 over the next two years a considerable amount of money was spent on mallory with the building of new spectator stands and a new commentators press and timekeepers boxes further developments took place raising the standard of the track crowd grew and in 1962 over 50,000 people paid to see the post tt international motor cycle meeting when mike hailwood won improving the lap record to 91.70mph this led to it race of the year and sidecar race of the year being sponsored by the daily mail under the control of grovewood securities mallory enjoyed its golden days in the 1960s and 1970s with some of the greatest names in motorsport competing there amongst these a young austrian who arrived for the whit sunday meeting in 1964 for his first race in england in a new formula two brabham jochen rindt he asked denny hulme if he could follow him round to learn the circuit and then proceeded to set fastest time in qualifying despite being delayed in the race he finished third behind the reigning world champion jim clark and his experienced team-mate peter arundell34 1970sedit throughout the sixties and seventies the circuit hosted almost every major british car and bike championship however on occasions there were european championship events for example 12 march 1972 saw fia european formula two championship with dave morgan winning in his reeves racing brabham-ford bt38 from the future ferrari pairing of niki lauda and carlos reutemann 1970 saw mallory used as a venue for cycle racing with the world road race championships being run on a road course starting and finishing at mallory and incorporating the circuit reversed each lap the professional event was won by ill-fated belgian jean-pierre monser5 formula two returned again 1973 this time morgan could only finish third the victor was frenchman jean-pierre jarier in his works march-bmw 732 second was dave mcconnell after a little over 20 years the owners of mallory park decided that enough was enough and offered the estate for sale no doubt the expense of bringing brands hatch which grovewood also owned up to current grand prix standards had some effort on the decision and the re-opening of donington park which was only some 20 miles away may have influenced the decision whatever the reasons mallory was once more on the market but reportedly with a restriction in its future use for motor sport on its future use for motor racing although planning permission had been obtained for the erection of 30 dwelling on the estate3 meanwhile famously the bay city rollers tartan army played a concert during a bbc-organised fun day on 18

purchase late in 1982 and reopened the circuit on 29 may 1983 the first race of the new era being organised by the 750 motor club there was no interruption to the programme and mallory went from strength to strength apart from a hiccup from in december 1985 when the local borough council served a noise nuisance order which restricted use of the circuit to 40 days a year on sundays there is an

one was a long time coming for it was not until 1966 that it finally happened when on 29 may denny hulme took a lola t70 round in 47.6sec at a speed of 102.10mph two years later roy pike established the first formula three 100mph lap in a titan which he took round in 48sec 101.25mph with coming of the large capacity single-seater like the formula 5000 and formula one cars the outright record continue to fall until in 1979 ricardo zunino took an arrows a1 round in 40.065sec at an incredible 121.32mph 22 years after the 100mph late vincenzo sospiri established the first such lap in a

host to the grand prix of great britain in 2008 the event was being organised by off-road promotions company rhl who originally planned to use the former grand prix circuit at foxhill near swindon until it became apparent that the infrastructure at the wiltshire venue would not be sufficient for such a high-profile event the event was seen as a success by fans with over 30,000 fans in attendance over the weekend however the grand prix only returned once more in 2009 the circuit has been unused since late 2013 and has fallen into disuse motocross activities ended due to noise
