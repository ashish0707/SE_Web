his injuries left him in hospital sir crispin tickell a former british diplomat at the united nations who was then warden at green college oxford made the young protester a visiting fellow16 he was an

acres five hectares of prime real estate on the river in london on which its owner beverages multinational diageo intended to build a superstore the protesters defeated diageo in court built an eco-village and held on to the land for six months17 among his best-known articles are his critique of david bellamys climate science18 his description of an encounter with a police torturer in brazil19 his attack on libertarian interpretations of genetics20 his discussion of the ethics of outsourcing21 and his attack on the politics of bob geldof and bono22 in january 2011 monbiot took the

journalists to follow suit he continues to publish his financial accounts on his website24 he has held visiting fellowships or professorships at the universities of oxford environmental policy bristol philosophy keele politics oxford brookes planning and east london environmental sciencecitation needed monbiot lived in oxford for many years but in 2007 moved with his then-wife writer and campaigner angharad penrhyn jones and daughter to a low emissions house in the mid-wales market town of machynlleth25 monbiots second daughter was born in the spring of 2012.26 because his new partner lives in oxford monbiot had returned there by 2013.27 in november 2012 he apologised to lord mcalpine for his stupidity and thoughtlessness in implying in a tweet that the tory peer was a paedophile282930 in march 2013 monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with lord mcalpines representatives monbiot agreed to carry out over the next three years work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to 25,000 which he described as an unprecedented settlement31 activismedit climate changeedit monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat global warming32 monbiot has written that climate change is the moral question of the 21st century and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change including setting targets on greenhouse emissions using the latest science issuing every citizen with a personal carbon ration new building regulations with houses built to german passivhaus standards banning incandescent light bulbs patio heaters garden floodlights and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications constructing large offshore wind farms replacing the national gas grid with a hydrogen pipe network a new national coach network to make journeys using public transport faster than using a car all petrol stations to supply leasable electric car batteries with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries scrap road-building and road-widening programmes redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change reduce uk airport capacity by 90 percent closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system33 monbiot says the campaign against climate change is unlike almost all the public protests that came before it it is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity it is a campaign not for more freedom but for less strangest of all it is a campaign not just against other people but against ourselves34 monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land and should seek to stay there why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible3536 while he does recognize that recession can cause hardship he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well for example the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution36 monbiot purchased a used diesel renault clio after moving to machynlleth in 2007.37 he has travelled through canada and the united states campaigning on climate change and promoting his book he contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there3839 he is the patron of the uk student campaign network people planet40 and appears in the film the age of stupid in animated form in which he says the very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation its happening right now means that we are tremendously powerful people so this position of despair and i cant do anything and theres no point is completely illogical its exactly the opposite4142 monbiot attended the 2009 united nations climate change conference held in copenhagen monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry43 he finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in march 2011 although he still loathes the liars who run the nuclear industry44 monbiot now advocates its use having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region44 subsequently he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement writing that it has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human healthmade claims ungrounded in science unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong he singled out helen caldicott for he wrote making unsourced and inaccurate claims dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up and overstating the death toll from the chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140.45 in october 2013 monbiot criticized the selection of a generation iii reactor design for the hinkley point c nuclear power station due to cost as well as for a half century requirement of uranium mining and transuranic waste production he contrasted this with two generation iv reactor concepts if integral fast reactors were deployed the uks stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low-carbon energy to meet all uk demand for 500 years these reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained solving three huge problemsenergy supply nuclear waste and climate changeat once thorium reactors use an element thats already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries they recycle their own waste leaving almost nothing behind46 cf similar comments by james hansen in 2012 monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for industry and consumer capitalism to deep-fry the lot of us citing a report of 110 million barrels per day in 2020.4748 debate with ian plimeredit monbiot harshly criticised the book heaven and earth by climate change skeptic ian plimer saying that since its publication in australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors and its fudging and manipulation of the data49 plimer challenged monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book monbiot agreed on the condition that plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of the guardian so there would be a factual basis to the discussion50 plimer refused and monbiot labeled plimer a grandstander with a broad yellow streak who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his heaven and earth book and accused him of trying to drown out the precise refutations published by his books reviewers51 plimer then reversed his decision and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate52 monbiots response on receiving plimers contribution was one of disappointment on the grounds that plimers response so far consists not of answers but of questions addressed to me53 monbiot told plimer that he is not qualified to answer plimers questions53 although gavin schmidt of nasa did answer them54 on 2 september 2009 monbiot published another column in the guardian asking is ian plimer ever going to answer my questions and suggested that plimer was evading the questions by using the chewbacca defence55 a debate was subsequently held on 15 december while monbiot was in copenhagen on the australian broadcasting corporations lateline programme moderated by tony jones5657 attempted arrest of john boltonedit monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a citizens arrest of john bolton a former us ambassador to the united nations when the latter attended the hay festival to give a talk on international relations in may 2008 monbiot argued that bolton was one of the instigators of the iraq war of which monbiot was an opponent58 political partiesedit he was involved initially with the respect political party but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the green party in the 2004 election to the european parliament59 in an interview with the british political blog third estate in september 2009 monbiot expressed his support for the policies of plaid cymru saying i have finally found the party that i feel very comfortable with thats not to say i feel uncomfortable with the green party on the whole i support it but i feel even more comfortable with plaid60 in april 2010 he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the liberal democrats published in the guardian61 prior to the 2015 uk general election he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the green partys caroline lucas62 indigenous rightsedit monbiot has been associated with the cause of indigenous rights and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people at the face of corporate interests6364 he contributed to the 2009 book we are one a celebration of tribal peoples65 which explores the culture of peoples around the world portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces published worksedit monbiots first book was poisoned arrows 1989 a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the devastating effects of the partially world bank-funded transmigration program on the peoples and tribes of papua and west papua in indonesia it was followed by amazon watershed 1991 which documented expulsions of brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the yanomami indians and showed how timber sold in britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in brazil his third book no mans land an investigative journey through kenya and tanzania 1994 documented the seizure of land and cattle from nomadic people in kenya and the tanzania byamong other forcesgame parks and safari tourism in 2000 he published captive state the corporate takeover of britain the book examines the role of corporate power in the united kingdom on both local and national levels and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy subjects discussed in the book include the building of the skye bridge corporate involvement in the national health service the role of business in university research and the conditions which influence the granting of planning permission monbiot at a make poverty history rally in scotland the age of consentedit his fifth book the age of consent a manifesto for a new world order was published in 2003 the book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the global justice movement monbiot criticises anarchism and marxism arguing that any possible solution to the worlds inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system the four main changes to global governance which monbiot argues for are a democratically elected world parliament which would pass resolutions on international issues a democratised united nations general assembly to replace the unelected un security council the proposed international clearing union which would automatically discharge trade deficits and prevent the accumulation of debt and a fair trade organisation which would regulate world trade in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries66 the book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice he posits that the united states and western european states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the soft landing option however monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a final or definitive answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions he argues that ultimately the global justice movement must seekto provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests heatedit monbiots next book heat how to stop the planet burning published in 2006 focuses on the issue of climate change he points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossil-fuel companies primarily exxon-mobil and traces the network of fake citizens groups and bogus scientific bodies campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease67 he argues that a 90 percent reduction in carbon emissions is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate he then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the united kingdom without a significant fall in living standards through changes in housing power supply and transport feraledit feral searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding was published in 2013 and focuses on the concept of rewilding the planet monbiot states rewilding offers a positive environmentalism environmentalists have long known what they are against now we can explain what we are for68 in the book monbiot attacks sheep farming as a slow-burning ecological disaster which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed69 he particularly looks at sheep farming in wales the book received favourable reviews including in publications normally hostile to his work such as the spectator70 and the daily telegraph69 it won the society of biology book award for
