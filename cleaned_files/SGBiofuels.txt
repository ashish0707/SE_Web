funding was led by two privately held companies involved in the development of renewable energy chemicals and biotechnology flint hills resources a subsidiary of koch industries and life technologies1 jatropha cultivation research and sgb historyedit sg biofuels grows jatropha in greenhouses and on plantations in latin and central america for sustainable biofuel production and researches methods with which to optimize the jatropha seeds and growing processes jatropha has been growing successfully in tropical and subtropical locations for many years and has been cited as one of the best candidates for biodiesel production because of its high oil content30 to 40 percent2 the companys research focuses on the domestication and genetic improvement of jatropha areas of focus include increasing oil content per seed increasing number of seeds per plant improving flowering synchronicity and improving pest and disease resistance the company also researches strains that can sustain colder temperatures for growth in the us2 the companys jatropha research and development center has the worlds largest and most diverse collection of jatropha genetic material3 the companys website states that its germplasm library holds over 12,000 unique jatropha genotypes preliminary molecular marker studies indicate that sg biofuels jatropha germplasm collection exhibits on the order of 5 times the genetic diversity observed in a collection of jatropha from india africa and asia4 in march 2010 sg biofuels launched its first jmax100 cultivar a proprietary cultivar of jatropha optimized for growing conditions in guatemala with yields averaging approximately 100 percent greater than existing varieties5 in august 2010 sg biofuels and life technologies announced that they had completed the genome sequencing of jatropha6 in august 2011 sg biofuels sgb initiated a program with bharat renewable energy ltd brel a joint-venture of bharat petroleum indias second largest petroleum company
