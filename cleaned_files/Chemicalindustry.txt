production 5.1 continents and countries 6 see also 7 references historyedit although chemicals were made and used throughout history the birth of the heavy chemical industry production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses coincided with the beginnings of the industrial revolution in general industrial revolutionedit one of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial process was sulfuric acid in 1736 the pharmacist joshua ward developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter and allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water it was the first practical production of sulfuric acid on a large scale john roebuck and samuel garbett were the first to establish a large-scale factory in prestonpans scotland in 1749 which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid12 charles tennants st rollox chemical works in 1831 then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world in the early 18th century cloth was bleached by treating it with stale urine or sour milk and exposing it to sunlight for long periods of time which created a severe bottleneck in production sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as lime by the middle of the century but it was the discovery of bleaching powder by charles tennant that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise his powder was made by reacting chlorine with dry slaked lime and proved to be a cheap and successful product he opened a factory in st rollox north of glasgow and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later3 soda ash was used since ancient times in the production of glass textile soap and paper and the source of the potash had traditionally been wood ashes in western europe by the 18th century this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation and the french academy of sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a method to produce alkali from sea salt sodium chloride the leblanc process was patented in 1791 by nicolas leblanc who then built a leblanc plant at saint-denis4 he was denied his prize money because of the french revolution5 however it was in britain that the leblanc process really took off5 william losh built the first soda works in britain at the losh wilson and bell works on the river tyne in 1816 but it remained on a small scale due to large tariffs on salt production until 1824 when these tariffs were repealed the british soda industry was able to rapidly expand james muspratts chemical works in liverpool and charles tennants complex near glasgow became the largest chemical production centres anywhere by the 1870s the british soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined ernest solvay patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of soda ash these huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the industrial revolution matured originally large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda provoking one of the first pieces of environmental legislation to be passed in 1863 this provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali the solvay process was developed by the belgian industrial chemist ernest solvay in 1861 in 1864 solvay and his brother alfred constructed a plant in the belgian town of charleroi and in 1874 they expanded into a larger plant in nancy france the new process proved more economical and less polluting than the leblanc method and its use spread in the same year ludwig mond visited solvay to acquire the rights to use his process and he and john brunner formed the firm of brunner mond co and built a solvay plant at winnington england mond was instrumental in making the solvay process a commercial success he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process expansion and maturationedit the late 19th century saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured large chemical industries also took shape in germany and later in the united states the factories of the german firm basf in 1866 production of artificial manufactured fertilizer for agriculture was pioneered by sir john lawes at his purpose-built rothamsted research facility in the 1840s he established large works near london for the manufacture of superphosphate of lime processes for the vulcanization of rubber were patented by charles goodyear in the united states and thomas hancock in england in the 1840s the first synthetic dye was discovered by william henry perkin in london he partly transformed aniline into a crude mixture which when extracted with alcohol produced a substance with an intense purple colour he also developed the first synthetic perfumes however it was german industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes the three major firms basf bayer and hoechst produced several hundred different dyes and by 1913 the german industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad6 in the united states herbert henry dows use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from brine was a commercial success that helped to promote the countrys chemical industry7 the petrochemical industry can be traced back to the oil works of james young in scotland and abraham pineo gesner in canada the first plastic was invented by alexander parkes an english metallurgist in 1856 he patented parkesine a celluloid based on nitrocellulose treated with a variety of solvents8 this material exhibited at the 1862 london international exhibition anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics the industrial production of soap from vegetable oils was started by william lever and his brother james in 1885 in lancashire based on a modern chemical process invented by william hough watson that used glycerin and vegetable oils9 by the 1920s chemical firms consolidated into large conglomerates ig farben in germany rhne-poulenc in france and imperial chemical industries in britain dupont became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in america currently chemical production is a high-tech industry where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost10 productsedit polymers and plastics especially polyethylene polypropylene polyvinyl chloride polyethylene terephthalate polystyrene and polycarbonate comprise about 80 of the industrys output worldwidecitation needed these materials are often converted to fluoropolymer tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials11 chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods as well as thousands of inputs to agriculture manufacturing construction and service industries the chemical industry itself consumes 26 percent of its own outputcitation needed major industrial customers include rubber and plastic products textiles apparel petroleum refining pulp and paper and primary metals chemicals are nearly a 3 trillion global enterprise and the eu and us chemical companies are the worlds largest producerscitation needed sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories including basic chemicals about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output life sciences 30 percent specialty chemicals 20 to 25 percent and consumer products about 10 percent12 basic chemicals commodity chemicals to polymers and speciality chemicalsedit new polypropylene plant pp3 in the slovnaft oil refinery bratislava slovakia basic chemicals or commodity chemicals are a broad chemical category including polymers bulk petrochemicals and intermediates other derivatives and basic industrials inorganic chemicals and fertilizers

at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value includes all categories of plastics and man-made fiberscitation needed the major markets for plastics are packaging followed by home construction containers appliances pipe transportation toys and games the largest-volume polymer product polyethylene pe is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles containers and pipe polyvinyl chloride pvc another large-volume product is principally used to make pipe for construction markets as well as siding and to a much smaller extent transportation and packaging materials polypropylene pp similar in volume to pvc is used in markets ranging from packaging appliances and containers to clothing and carpeting polystyrene ps another large-volume plastic is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation the leading man-made fibers include polyester nylon polypropylene and acrylics with applications including apparel home furnishings and other industrial and consumer use the principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicalscitation needed chemicals in the bulk petrochemicals and intermediates are primarily made from liquefied petroleum gas lpg natural gas and crude oil their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicalscitation needed typical large-volume products include ethylene propylene benzene toluene xylenes methanol vinyl chloride monomer vcm styrene butadiene and ethylene oxide these basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many polymers and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the specialty chemicals category see below other derivatives and basic industrials include synthetic rubber surfactants dyes and pigments turpentine resins carbon black explosives and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals external sales inorganic chemicals about 12

dioxide and hydrogen peroxide fertilizers are the smallest category about 6 percent and include phosphates ammonia and potash chemicals life sciencesedit life sciences about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business include differentiated chemical and biological substances pharmaceuticals diagnostics animal health products vitamins and pesticides while much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors their products tend to have very high pricesover ten dollars per poundgrowth rates of 1.5 to 6 times gdp and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the food and drug administration pesticides also called crop protection chemicals are about 10 percent of this category and include herbicides insecticides and fungicidescitation needed specialty chemicalsedit specialty chemicals are a category of relatively high valued rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets typical growth rates are one to three times gdp with prices over a dollar per pound they are generally characterized by their innovative aspects products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain products include electronic chemicals industrial gases adhesives and sealants as well as coatings industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals and catalysts in 2012 excluding fine chemicals the 546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33 paints coating and surface treatments 27 advanced polymer 14 adhesives and sealants 13 additives and 13 pigments and inks13 speciality chemicals are sold as effect or performance chemicals sometimes they are mixtures of formulations unlike fine chemicals which are almost always single-molecule products consumer productsedit consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as soaps detergents and cosmetics typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times gdp consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives such as in plastics cleaning materials cosmetics paints coatings electronic gadgets automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes14 these speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as pesticides speciality polymers electronic chemicals surfactants construction chemicals industrial cleaners flavours and fragrances speciality

in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat friction pressure emissions and contaminants from the perspective of chemical engineers the chemical industry involves the use of chemical processes such as chemical reactions and refining methods to produce a wide variety of solid liquid and gaseous materials most of these products serve to manufacture other items although a smaller number go directly to consumers solvents pesticides lye washing soda and portland cement provide a few examples of product used by consumers the industry includes manufacturers of inorganic- and organic-industrial chemicals ceramic products petrochemicals agrochemicals polymers and rubber elastomers oleochemicals oils fats and waxes explosives fragrances and flavors examples of these products are shown in the table below product type examples inorganic industrial ammonia chlorine

nitroglycerin ammonium nitrate nitrocellulose fragrances and flavors benzyl benzoate coumarin vanillin industrial gases nitrogen oxygen acetylene nitrous oxide although the pharmaceutical industry is often consideredwho a chemical industry  it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category other closely related industries include petroleum glass paint ink sealant adhesive and food processing manufacturers chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in chemical plants to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels in many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of catalysts the products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including distillation especially fractional distillation precipitation crystallization adsorption filtration sublimation and drying the processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site quality control laboratories to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required specifications more organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and manufacturing standards16 the products are packaged and delivered by many methods including pipelines tank-cars and tank-trucks for both solids and liquids cylinders drums bottles and boxes chemical companies often have a research-and-development laboratory for developing and testing products and processes these facilities may include pilot plants and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plants world chemical productionedit distillation columns the scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume petrochemicals and commodity chemicals to specialty chemicals and the smallest fine chemicals the petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world for example in texas and louisiana along the gulf coast of the united states on teesside in the northeast of england in the united kingdom and in rotterdam in the netherlands the large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations port facilities road and rail terminals to demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above some 50 of the united kingdoms petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the northeast of england process industry cluster on teesside specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes these manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks continents and countriesedit in the us there are 170 major chemical companiescitation needed they operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the us and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating the us chemical output is 750 billion a year the us industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the united states alone the chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over 5 billion annually on pollution abatement in europe the chemical plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectorscitation needed together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 23 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the eu in 2012 the chemical sector accounted for 12 of the eu manufacturing industrys added value europe remains worlds biggest chemical trading region with 43 of the worlds exports and 37of the worlds imports although the latest data shows that asia is catching up with 34 of the exports and 37 of imports17 even so europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except japan and china where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance europes trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion euros18 over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the european chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion euros to 539 billion euros a picture of constant growth despite this the european industrys share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36 to 20 this has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like india and china19 the data suggest that 95 of this impact is from china alone in 2012 the data from the european chemical industry council ceficshows that 5 european countries account for 71 of the eus chemicals sales these are germany france united kingdom italy and the netherlands20 the chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty yearscitation needed the fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics fibres and elastomers historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world western europe north america and japan the triad the european community remains the largest producer area followed by the us and japan the traditional dominance of chemical production by the triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price labour cost energy cost differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in china india korea the middle east south east asia nigeria and brazil just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope the bulk of the worlds 3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations the united states alone produced 689 billion 18.6 percent of the total world chemical
