dexter white the founding fathers of both the world bank and the international monetary fund imf5 the world bank was created at the 1944 bretton woods conference along with three other institutions including the international monetary fund imf the president of the world bank is traditionally an american6 the world bank and the imf are both based in washington dc and work closely with each other the gold room at the mount washington hotel where the international monetary fund and world bank were established although many countries were represented at the bretton woods conference the united states and united kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and dominated the negotiations75254 19441974edit before 1974 the reconstruction and development loans provided by the world bank were relatively small the banks staff were aware of the need to instill confidence in the bank fiscal conservatism ruled and loan applications had to meet strict criteria75660 the first country to receive a world bank loan was france the banks president at the time john mccloy chose france over two other applicants poland and chile the loan was for us250million half the amount requested and it came with strict conditions france had to agree to produce a balanced budget and give priority of debt repayment to the world bank over other governments world bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure that the french government met the conditions in addition before the loan was approved the united states state department told the french government that its members associated with the communist party would first have to be removed the french government complied with this diktat and removed the communist coalition government within hours the loan to france was approved8288 290291 when the marshall plan went into effect in 1947 many european countries began receiving aid from other sources faced with this competition the world bank shifted its focus to non-european countries until 1968 its loans were earmarked for the construction of income-producing infrastructure such as seaports highway systems and power plants that would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan in 1960 the international development association was formed as opposed to a un fund named sunfed providing soft loans to developing countries 19741980edit from 1974 to 1980 the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people in the developing world the size and number of loans to borrowers was greatly increased as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services and other sectors9 these changes can be attributed to robert mcnamara who was appointed to the presidency in 1968 by lyndon b johnson76063 mcnamara implored bank treasurer eugene rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern banks that had been the primary sources of funding rotberg used the global bond market to increase the capital available to the bank10 one consequence of the period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of third world debt from 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average annual rate of 20.1112 in 1980 the world bank administrative tribunal was established to decide on disputes between the world bank group and its staff where allegation of non-observance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been honored13 19801989edit in 1980 mcnamara was succeeded by us president jimmy carters nominee a w clausen1415 clausen replaced many members of mcnamaras staff and instituted a new ideological focus his 1982 decision to replace the banks chief economist hollis b chenery with anne krueger was an indication of this new focus krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for describing third world governments as rent-seeking states during the 1980s the bank emphasized lending to service third-world debt and structural adjustment policies designed to streamline the economies of developing nations unicef reported in the late 1980s that the structural adjustment programs of the world bank had been responsible for reduced health nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of children in asia latin america and africa16 1989presentedit beginning in 1989 in response to harsh criticism from many groups the bank began including environmental groups and ngos in its loans to mitigate the past effects of its development policies that had prompted the criticism79397 it also formed an implementing agency in accordance with the montreal protocols to stop ozone-depletion damage to the earths atmosphere by phasing out the use of 95 of ozone-depleting chemicals with a target date of 2015 since then in accordance with its so-called six strategic themes the bank has put various additional policies into effect to preserve the environment while promoting development for example in 1991 the bank announced that to protect against deforestation especially in the amazon it would not finance any commercial logging or infrastructure projects that harm the environment in order to promote global public goods the world bank tries to control communicable disease such as malaria delivering vaccines to several parts of the world and joining combat forces in 2000 the bank announced a war on aids and in 2011 the bank joined the stop tuberculosis partnership17 less recently a project in seychelles to promote local tourism by the name of project magic was launched in 2010 its successor project time was scheduled to be launched in 2012 traditionally based on a tacit understanding between the united states and europe the president of the world bank has always been selected from candidates nominated by the united

2015 within reach in some cases for the goals to be realized six criteria must be met stronger and more inclusive growth in africa and fragile states more effort in health and education integration of the development and environment agendas more as well as better aid movement on trade negotiations and stronger and more focused support from multilateral institutions like the world bank19 eradicate extreme poverty and hunger from 1990 through 2004 the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell from almost a third to less than a fifth although results vary widely within regions and countries the trend indicates that the world as a whole can meet the goal of halving the percentage of people living in poverty africas poverty however is expected to rise and most of the 36 countries where 90 of the worlds undernourished children live are in africa less than a quarter of countries are on track for achieving the goal of halving under-nutrition achieve universal primary education the percentage of children in school in developing countries increased from 80 in 1991 to 88 in 2005 still about 72million children of primary school age 57 of them girls were not being educated as of

maternal health almost all of the half million women who die during pregnancy or childbirth every year live in sub-saharan africa and asia there are numerous causes of maternal death that require a variety of health care interventions to be made widely accessible combat hivaids malaria and other diseases annual numbers of new hiv infections and aids deaths have fallen but the number of people living with hiv continues to grow in the eight worst-hit southern african countries prevalence is above 15 percent treatment has increased globally but still meets only 30 percent of needs with wide variations across countries aids remains the leading cause of death in sub-saharan africa 1.6million deaths in 2007 there are 300 to 500million cases of malaria each year leading to more than 1million deaths nearly all the cases and more than 95 percent of the deaths occur in sub-saharan africa ensure environmental sustainability deforestation remains a critical problem particularly in regions of biological diversity which continues to decline greenhouse gas emissions are increasing faster than energy technology advancement develop a global partnership for development donor countries have renewed their commitment donors have to fulfill their pledges to match the current rate of core program development emphasis is being placed on the bank groups collaboration with multilateral and local partners to quicken progress toward the mdgs realization to make sure that world bank-financed operations do not compromise these goals but instead add to their realisation environmental social

official open access repository for its research outputs and knowledge products the world banks repository is listed in the registry of research data repositories re3dataorg51 criticismsedit the world bank has long been criticized by non-governmental organizations such as the indigenous rights group survival international and academics including its former chief economist joseph stiglitz henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises525354 henry hazlitt argued that the world bank along with the monetary system it was designed within would promote world inflation and a world in which international trade is state-dominated when they were being advocated55 stiglitz argued that the so-called free market reform policies that the bank advocates are often harmful to economic development if implemented badly too quickly shock therapy in the wrong sequence or in weak uncompetitive economies5356 one of the strongest criticisms of the world bank has been the way in which it is governed while the world bank represents 188 countries it is run by a small number of economically powerful countries these countries which also provide most of the institutions funding choose the leadership and senior management of the world bank and so their interests dominate the bank57190 titus alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the world banks role in developing countries makes it similar to the south african development bank under apartheid and therefore a pillar of global apartheid58133141 in the 1990s the world bank and the imf forged the washington consensus policies that included deregulation and liberalization of markets privatization and the downscaling of government though the washington consensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development it was criticized for ignoring equity employment and how reforms like privatization were carried out joseph stiglitz argued that the washington consensus placed too much emphasis on the growth of gdp and not enough on the permanence of growth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards5417 the united states senate committee on foreign relations report criticized the world bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too much on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results within a finite period of time and called on the institution to strengthen anti-corruption efforts59 criticism of the world bank often takes the form of protesting as seen in recent events such as the world bank oslo 2002 protests60 the october rebellion61 and the battle of seattle62 such demonstrations have occurred all over the world even among the brazilian kayapo people63 another source of criticism has been the tradition of having an american head the bank implemented because the united states provides the majority of world bank funding when economists from the world bank visit poor countries to dispense cash and advice observed the economist in 2012 they routinely tell governments to reject cronyism and fill each important job with the best candidate available it is good advice the world bank should take it64 jim yong kim a korean-american is the most recently appointed president of the world bank65 structural adjustmentedit the effect of structural adjustment policies on poor countries has been one of the most significant criticisms of the world bank66 the 1979 energy crisis plunged many countries into economic crisis6768 the world bank responded with structural adjustment loans which distributed aid to struggling countries while enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal imbalance some of these policies included encouraging production investment and labour-intensive manufacturing changing real exchange rates and altering the distribution of government resources structural adjustment policies were most effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these policies to be implemented easily for some countries particularly in sub-saharan africa economic growth regressed and inflation worsened the alleviation of poverty was not a goal of structural adjustment loans and the circumstances of the poor often worsened due to a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food as subsidies were lifted6769 by the late 1980s international organizations began to admit that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the worlds poor the world bank changed structural adjustment loans allowing for social spending to be maintained and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises6770 in 1999 the world bank and the imf introduced the poverty reduction strategy paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans68147 the poverty reduction strategy paper approach has been interpreted as an extension of structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities neither approach has addressed the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries68152 fairness of assistance conditionsedit some critics69 most prominently the author naomi klein are of the opinion that the world bank groups loans and aid have unfair conditions attached to them that reflect the interests financial power and political doctrines notably the washington consensus of the bank and by extension the countries that are most influential within it among other allegations klein says the groups credibility was damaged when it forced school fees on students in ghana in exchange for a loan when it demanded that tanzania privatise its water system when it made telecom privatisation a condition of aid for hurricane mitch when it demanded labour flexibility in sri lanka in the aftermath of the asian tsunami when it pushed for eliminating food subsidies in post-invasion iraq70 sovereign immunityedit the world bank requires sovereign immunity from countries it deals with717273 sovereign immunity waives a holder from all legal liability for their actions it is proposed that this immunity from responsibility is a shield which the world bank wants to resort to for escaping accountability and security by the people71 as the united states has veto power it can prevent the world bank from taking action against its interests71 controversyedit world bank favored pricewaterhousecoopers 1998edit world bank favored pwc as a consultant in a bid for privatising the water
