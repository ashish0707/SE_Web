nasagoddard space flight center and orbimagecitation needed the biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems the two joined words are bio and sphere it can also be termed as the zone of life on earth a closed system apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth and largely self-regulating1 by the most general biophysiological definition the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere the biosphere is postulated to have evolved beginning with a process of biopoesis life created naturally from non-living matter such as simple organic compounds or biogenesis life created from living matter at least some 3.5 billion years ago23 the earliest evidence for life on earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western greenland4 and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia56 more recently in 2015 remains of biotic life were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia78 according to one of the researchers if life arose relatively quickly on earth  then it could be common in the universe7 in a general sense biospheres are any closed self-regulating systems containing ecosystems this includes artificial biospheres such as biosphere 2 and bios-3 and potentially ones on other planets or moons9 contents 1 origin and use of the term 1.1 narrow definition 2 extent of earths biosphere 3 specific

and atmosphere air the term biosphere was coined by geologist eduard suess in 1875 which he defined as the place on earths surface where life dwells10 while the concept has a geological origin it is an indication of the effect of both charles darwin and matthew f maury on the earth sciences the biospheres ecological context comes from the 1920s see vladimir i vernadsky preceding the 1935 introduction of the term ecosystem by sir arthur tansley see ecology history vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere it is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy geophysics meteorology biogeography evolution geology geochemistry hydrology and generally speaking all life and earth sciences narrow definitionedit geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms the biomass or biota as referred to by biologists and ecologists in this sense the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model the other three being geosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere when these four component spheres are combined into one system it is known as the ecosphere this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet11 the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of earths biosphere ie artificial earth-like biospheres12 others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheresfor example human-centered biospheres or a native martian biosphereas part of the

microbiology have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earths terrestrial surface and that the total mass of microbial life in so-called uninhabitable zones may in biomass exceed all animal and plant life on the surface the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800m 5,900ft 1.1mi and fish live as much as 8,372m 27,467ft 5.202mi underwater in the puerto rico trench2 there are more extreme examples for life on the planet rppells vulture has been found at altitudes of 11,300m 37,100ft 7.0mi bar-headed

animals at these elevations depend on lichens grasses and herbs microscopic organisms live in every part of the biosphere including soil hot springs seven miles deep in the ocean 40 miles high in the atmosphere and inside rocks far down within the earths crust see also endolith13 microorganisms under certain test conditions have been observed to thrive in the vacuum of outer space1415 the total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 x 1017 g or the weight of the united kingdom13 the mass of prokaryote microorganisms which includes bacteria and archaea but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon of the total biosphere mass estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons16 barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000m 33,000ft 6.2mi in the mariana trench the deepest spot in the earths oceans17 in fact single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench by the challenger deep at depths of 11,034m 36,201ft 6.856mi.181920 other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580m 1,900ft 0.36mi below the sea floor under 2,590m 8,500ft 1.61mi of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states1921 as well as 2,400m 7,900ft 1.5mi beneath the seabed off japan22 culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5,000m 16,000ft 3.1mi into the earths crust in sweden23 from rocks between 6575c 149167f temperature increases with increasing depth into the earths crust the rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors including type of crust continental vs oceanic rock type geographic location etc the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122c 252f methanopyrus kandleri strain 116 and it is likely that the limit of life in the deep biosphere is defined by temperature rather than absolute depthcitation needed on 20 august 2014 scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800m 2,600ft 0.50mi below the ice of antarctica2425 according to one researcher you can find microbes everywhere theyre extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are19 our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna on land biomes are separated primarily by latitude terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic and antarctic circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator specific biospheresedit for

rare earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare save ones composed of microbial life only28 on the other hand earth analogs may be quite numerous at least in the milky way galaxy29 given limited understanding of abiogenesis it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future for example on mars30 the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earths biosphere is called terraforming31 see alsoedit environment portal ecology portal earth
