ku-ring-gai chase national park the first people to inhabit the area now known as sydney were indigenous australians having migrated from northern australia and before that from southeast asia radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the sydney area from around 30,735 years ago9 however numerous aboriginal stone tools were found in western sydneys gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years bp27 which would indicate that there was human settlement in sydney earlier than thought28 the earliest british settlers called them eora people eora is the term the indigenous population used to explain their origins upon first contact with the british its literal meaning is from this place prior to the arrival of the british there were 4,000 to 8,000 native people in sydney from as many as 29 different clans29 sydney cove from port jackson to petersham was inhabited by the cadigal clan29 the principal language groups were darug guringai and dharawal the earliest europeans to visit the area noted that the indigenous people were conducting activities such as camping and fishing using trees for bark and food collecting shells and cooking fish30 development has destroyed much of the citys history including that of the first inhabitants there continues to be examples of rock art and engravings located in the protected ku-ring-gai chase national park31 the first meeting between the native people and the british occurred on 29 april 1770 when lieutenant james cook landed at botany bay on the kurnell peninsula and encountered the gweagal clan303233 he noted in his journal that they were confused and somewhat hostile towards the foreign visitors30 cook was on a mission of exploration and was not commissioned to start a settlement he spent a short time collecting food and conducting scientific observations before continuing further north along the east coast of australia and claiming the new land he had discovered for britain establishment of the colonyedit a direct north general view of sydney cove by convict artist thomas watling in 1794 britainbefore that englandand ireland had for a long time been sending their convicts across the atlantic to the american colonies that trade was ended with the declaration of independence by the united states in 1776 overrun with prisoners britain decided in 1786 to found a new penal outpost in the territory discovered by cook some 16 years earlier the colony was at first to be titled new albion but phillip decided on sydney in recognition of the 1st baron sydneylater created the 1st viscount sydney in 1789and his role in authorising the establishment of the settlement34 captain philip led the first fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into botany bay on 18 january 1788 though deemed the location unsuitable due to poor soil and a lack of fresh water he travelled a short way further north and arrived at port jackson on 26 january 1788.3536 this was to be the location for the new colony phillip described sydney cove as being without exception the finest harbour in the world37 the official proclamation and naming of the colony happened on 7 february 1788 sydney cove from dawes point 1817 between 1788 and 1792 about 4,300 convicts were landed at sydney the colony was not founded on the principles of freedom and prosperity maps from this time show no prison buildings the punishment for convicts was transportation rather than incarceration but serious offences were penalised by flogging and hanging3839 officers and convicts alike faced starvation as supplies ran low and little could be cultivated from the land40 the regions indigenous population was also suffering it is estimated that half of the native people in sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789.2941 some mounted violent resistance to the british settlers lachlan macquarie became governor in 1810 macquarie did make the most of less than ideal circumstances his first task was to restore order after the rum rebellion of 1808 against the previous governor conditions in the colony were not conducive to the development of a thriving new metropolis but the more regular arrival of ships and the beginnings of maritime trade such as wool helped to lessen the burden of isolation3842 macquarie undertook an extensive building programme of some 265 separate works43 roads bridges wharves and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and come 1822 the town had banks markets and well-established thoroughfares part of macquaries effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens43 modern developmentedit the year 1840 was the final year of convict transportation to sydney which by this time had a population of 35,000.3538 the municipal council of sydney was incorporated in 1842 and became australias first city44 gold was discovered in the colony in 1851 and with it came thousands of people seeking to make money3544 sydneys population reached 200,000 by 1871.45 following the depression of the 1890s the six colonies agreed to form a federated nation of the commonwealth of australia under the reign of queen victoria federation of the six colonies occurred on 1 january 1901 sydney with a population of 481,000 then became the state capital of new south wales39 the great depression of the 1930s had a severe effect on sydneys economy as it did with most cities throughout the industrial world for much of the 1930s up to one in three breadwinners was unemployed46 construction of the sydney harbour bridge served to alleviate some of the effects of the economic downturn by employing 1,400 men between 1924 and 1932.47 the population continued to boom despite the depression and reached 1 million in 1925.45 sydney harbour in 1932 when britain declared war on germany in 1939 australia too entered during the war sydney experienced a surge in industrial development to meet the needs of a wartime economy far from mass unemployment there were now labour shortages and women becoming active in male roles sydneys harbour was attacked by the japanese in may and june 1942 with a direct attack from japanese submarines with some loss of life48 households throughout the city had built air raid shelters and performed drills following the end of the war the city continued to expand there were 1.7 million people living in sydney at 1950 and almost 3 million by 1975 the people of sydney warmly welcomed queen elizabeth ii in 1954 when the a reigning monarch stepped onto australian soil for the first time to commence her australian royal tour49 having arrived on the royal yacht britannia through sydney heads her majesty came ashore at farm cove sydneys iconic opera house was opened in 1973 by her majesty a strong rivalry between sydney and melbourne that began in the 1850s still exists to this day sydney exceeded melbournes

hornsby plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys the flat areas of the south were the first to be developed as the city grew it was not until the construction of the sydney harbour bridge that the northern reaches of the coast became more heavily populated seventy beaches can be found along its coastline with bondi beach being one of the most famous the nepean river wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the hawkesbury river before reaching broken bay most of sydneys water storages can be found on tributaries of the nepean river the parramatta river is mostly industrial and drains a large area of sydneys western suburbs into port jackson the southern parts of the city are drained by the georges river and the cooks river into botany bay in 1820s peter miller cunningham described the region west of parramatta and liverpool as a fine timbered country perfectly clear of bush through which you might generally speaking drive a gig in all directions without any impediment in the shape of rocks scrubs or close forest this confirmed earlier accounts by governor phillip who suggested that the trees were growing at a distance of some twenty to forty feet from each other and in general entirely free from brushwood56 vegetationedit a bushland in sydney with eucalyptus trees royal national park sutherland shire the most prevalent plant communities in the sydney region are dry sclerophyll forests57 which mainly consist of eucalyptus trees and sclerophyll shrubs in the understory sclerophyll forests developed as a result of the extreme age of the continent combined with aboriginal fire use deep weathering of the crust leached chemicals out of the rock leaving australian soils deficient in nutrients the most widespread

triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks the sydney basin was formed when the earths crust expanded subsided and filled with sediment in the early triassic period59 the sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from broken hill and laid down about 200 million years ago the sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds dotted throughout and it is some 200 metres 656 feet thick the basins sedimentary rocks have been subject to uplift with gentle folding and minor faulting during the formation of the great dividing range59 erosion by coastal streams has created a landscape of deep gorges and remnant plateaus the sydney basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs beaches and estuaries deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the triassic period in the hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region where sydney now lies the rising sea level between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours59

temperature recorded at observatory hill is 27.6c 82f in february 2011 while the lowest maximum temperature is 7.7c 46f recorded in july 1868.67 the weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs67 sydney experiences an urban heat island effect69 this makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat69 in late spring and summer temperatures over 35c 95f are not uncommon70 though hot dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster71 this powerful storm brings gale winds and rapid fall in temperature followed by brief heavy rain and thunder72 due to the inland location frost is recorded in western sydney a few times in winter autumn and spring are the transitional seasons with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn73 lightning as seen from the sydney harbour the rainfall has a moderate to low variability and it is evenly spread through the months though is slightly higher during the first half of the year6774 in late autumn and winter east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall especially in the cbd75 depending on the wind direction summer weather may be humid or dry with the late summerautumn period having a higher average humidity and dewpoints than late springearly summer in summer most rain falls from thunderstorms and in winter from cold fronts76 snowfall was last reported in the sydney city area in 1836 while a fall of graupel or soft hail mistaken by many for snow in july 2008 has raised the possibility that the 1836 event was not snow either77 the city is rarely affected by cyclones although remnants of ex-cyclones do affect the city the el niosouthern oscillation plays an important role in determining sydneys weather patterns drought and bushfire on the one hand and storms and flooding on the other associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation many areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires

further information climate change in australia and renewable energy in australia a cyclist in the city centre as climate change greenhouse gas emissions and pollution have become a major issue for australia sydney has in the past been criticised for its lack of focus on reducing pollution cutting back on emissions and maintaining water quality289 since 1995 there have been significant developments in the analysis of air pollution in the sydney metropolitan region the development led to the release of the metropolitan air quality scheme maqs which led to a broader understanding of the causation of pollution in sydney allowing the government to form appropriate responses to the pollution290 australian cities are some of the most car dependent cities in the world291 sydney in particular has a very high level of car dependency292 especially by world city standards it also has a low level of mass-transit services with a historically low-density layout and significant urban sprawl thus increasing the likelihood of car dependency293294 strategies have been implemented to reduce private vehicle pollution by encouraging mass and public transit295 initiating the development

warragamba dam is sydneys largest water supply dam obtaining sufficient fresh water was difficult during early colonial times a catchment called the tank stream sourced water from what is now the central business district but was little more than an open sewer by the end of the 1700s.311 the botany swamps scheme was one of several ventures during the mid 1800s that saw the construction of wells tunnels steam pumping stations and small dams to service sydneys growing population311 the first genuine solution to sydneys water demands was the upper nepean scheme which came into operation in 1886 and cost over 2 million it transports water 100 kilometres 62 miles from the nepean cataract and cordeaux rivers and continues to service about 15 of sydneys total water needs311 dams were built on these three rivers between 1907 and 1935.311 in 1977 the shoalhaven scheme brought several more dams into service312 the sydney catchment authority now manages eleven major dams warragamba
