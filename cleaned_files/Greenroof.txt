traditional sod roof in ljungris sweden traditional sod roofs can be seen in many places in the faroe islands green roof at the british horse society headquarters green roof of chicago city hall a green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium planted over a waterproofing membrane it may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems container gardens on roofs where plants are maintained in pots are not generally considered to be true green roofs although this is debated rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater green roofs serve several purposes for a building such as absorbing rainwater providing insulation creating a habitat for wildlife increasing benevolencecitation needed and decreasing stress of the people around the roof by providing a more aesthetically pleasing landscape and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the heat island effect1 they effectively utilize the natural functions of plants to filter water and treat air in urban and suburban landscapes2 there are two types of green roof intensive roofs which are thicker with a minimum depth of 12.8cm 5.0in and can support a wider variety of plants but are heavier and require more maintenance and extensive roofs which are shallow ranging in depth from 2cm 0.79in to 12.7cm 5.0in lighter than intensive green roofs and require minimal maintenance3 the term green roof may also be used to indicate roofs that use some form of green technology such as a cool roof a roof with solar thermal collectors or photovoltaic panels green roofs are also referred to as eco-roofs oikosteges vegetated roofs living roofs greenroofs and vcph4

hardiest surviving varieties selected for installation on the roof5 green roofs are used to reduce heating by adding mass and thermal resistance value a 2005 study by brad bass of the university of toronto showed that green roofs can also reduce heat loss and energy consumption in winter conditions6 reduce cooling by evaporative cooling loads on a building by fifty to ninety percent7 especially if it is glassed in so as to act as a terrarium and passive solar heat reservoir a concentration of green roofs in an urban area can even reduce the citys average temperatures during the summer reduce stormwater run off8 see water-wise gardening a study presented at the green roofs for healthy cities conference in june 2004 cited by the epa found water runoff was reduced by over 75 during rainstorms see the pdf at 9 for more information natural habitat creation10 see urban wilderness filter pollutants and carbon dioxide out of the air which helps lower disease rates such as asthma11 see green wall filter pollutants and heavy metals out of rainwater help to insulate a building for sound the soil helps to block lower frequencies and the plants block higher frequencies12 if installed correctly many living roofs can contribute to leed points increase agricultural space with green roofs water is stored by the substrate and then taken up by the plants from where it is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation green roofs not only retain rainwater but also moderate the temperature of the water and act as natural filters for any of the water that happens to run off green roof planted with dune plants from the shores of lake ontario suny-esf syracuse ny many green roofs are installed to comply with local regulations and government fees often regarding stormwater runoff management13 in areas with combined sewer-stormwater systems heavy storms can overload the wastewater system and cause it to flood dumping raw sewage into the local waterways green roofs decrease the total amount of runoff and slow the rate of runoff from the roof it has been found that they can retain up to 75 of rainwater gradually releasing it back into the atmosphere via condensation and transpiration while retaining pollutants in their soil14 often phosphorus and nitrogen are in this category of environmentally harmful substances even though they are stimulating to the growth of plant life and agriculture when these substances are added to a system it can create mass biological activity since they are considered limiting factors of plant growth and by adding more of them to a system it allows for more plant growth15elevation 314 a new development in washington dc uses green roofs to filter and store some of its storm water on site avoiding the need for expensive underground sand filters to meet dc department of health storm-water regulations combating the urban heat island effect16 is another reason for creating a green roof traditional building materials soak up the suns radiation and re-emit it as heat making cities at least 4c 7.2f hotter than surrounding areas on chicagos city hall by contrast which features a green roof roof temperatures on a hot day are typically 1.44.4c 2.57.9f cooler than they are on traditionally roofed buildings nearby17 green roofs are becoming common in chicago as well as in atlanta portland and other united states cities where their use is encouraged by regulations to combat the urban heat-island effect green roofs are a type of low impact development18 in the case of chicago the city has passed codes offering incentives to builders who put green roofs on their buildings the chicago city hall green roof is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of green roofs in the united states it was planted as an experiment to determine the effects a green roof would have on the microclimate of the roof following this and other studies it has now been estimated that if all the roofs in a major city were greened urban temperatures could be reduced by as much as 7 degrees celsius19 green roofs also provide habitats for plants insects and animals that otherwise have limited natural space in cities even in high-rise urban settings as tall as 19 stories it has been found that green roofs can attract beneficial insects birds bees and butterflies rooftop greenery complements wild areas by providing stepping stones for songbirds migratory birds and other wildlife facing shortages of natural habitat an additional environmental benefit of greens roofs is the ability to sequester carbon carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue the carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates20 a study on green roofs in michigan and maryland found the above ground biomass and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g c m2 and 107 g c m2  variations occurred among the different species of plant used substrate carbon content averaged 913 g c m2 and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g c m221 the sequestration can be improved by changing plant species increasing substrate depth substrate composition and management practices in a study done in michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g c m2 to 239 g c m2 for s acre and s album21 also by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage the direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for green roofs also indirectly reduce co2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings20 buildings in the us account for 38 of the total carbon dioxide emissions22 a model supported by the us department of energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11 reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs costs and financial benefitsedit roof gardens provide residents of an apartment complex in tongyang town tongshan county hubei with fresh produce a properly designed and installed extensive green-roof system can cost 108248m2 1023ft2 while an intensive green roof costs 3552368m2 33220ft2 however since most of the materials used to build the green roof can be salvaged it is estimated that the cost of replacing a green roof is generally one third of the initial installation costs23 with the initial cost of installing a green roof in mind there are many financial benefits that accompany green roofing green roofing can extend the lifespan of a roof by over 200 by covering the waterproofing membrane with growing medium and vegetation this shields the membrane from ultra-violet radiation and physical damage24 further penn state universitys green roof research center expects the lifespan of a roof to increase by as much as three times after greening the roof25 it is estimated that the installation of a green roof could increase the real estate value of an average house by about 7.26 reduction in energy use is an important property of green roofing by improving the thermal performance of a roof green roofing allows buildings to better retain their heat during the cooler winter months while reflecting and absorbing solar radiation during the hotter summer months allowing buildings to remain cooler a study conducted by environment canada found a 26 reduction in summer cooling needs and a 26 reduction in winter heat losses when a green roof is used27 with respect to hotter summer weather green roofing is able to reduce the solar heating of a building by reflecting 27 of solar radiation absorbing 60 by the vegetation through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration and absorbing the remaining 13 into the growing medium such mitigation of solar radiation has been found to reduce building temperatures by up to 20c and reduce energy needs for air-conditioning by 25 to 80 this reduction in energy required to cool a building in the summer is accompanied by a reduction in energy required to heat a building in the winter thus reducing the energy requirements of the building year-round which allows the building temperature to be controlled at a lower cost28 depending on the region in which a green roof is installed incentives may be available in the form of stormwater tax reduction grants or rebates the regions where these incentives will most likely be found are areas where failing storm water management infrastructure is in place urban heat island effect has significantly increased the local air temperature or areas where environmental contaminants in the storm water runoff is of great concern29 an example of such an incentive is a one-year property tax credit is available in new york city since 2009 for property owners who green at least 50 of their roof area30 disadvantagesedit the addition of a green roof to an existing structure led to this collapse at the city university of hong kong the main disadvantage of green roofs is that the initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof31 depending on what kind of green roof it is the maintenance costs could be higher but some types of green roof have little or no ongoing cost some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows the additional mass of the soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building this makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented due to a lack of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight32 some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roof because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted static loading the weight of a green roof caused the collapse of a large sports hall roof in hong kong in 2016.33 in the wake of the disaster numerous other green roofs around the territory were removed34 green roofs require significantly more maintenance and maintenance energy compared to a standard roof standard maintenance include removing debris controlling weeds deadhead trimming checking moisture levels and fertilizing35 the maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including climate intensity of rainfall type of building type of vegetation and external coatings36 the most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required during a 10-year roof maintenance cycle a house with a green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof the individual components of a green have co2 implications during the manufacturing process have additional implications compared to a conventional roof37 the embodied energy for green roof components are 23.6kg 52lb co2 per square meter of green roof this value is equivalent to 6448 g c m2 which is significantly greater than 378 g c m2 36 both sod roofs and lwa-based lightweight aggregates roofs have been found to have a negative impact on the quality of their resulting runoff38 typesedit an intensive and an extensive green roof section of a gudbrandsdal type sod roof with elaborate turf log green roofs can be categorized as intensive semi-intensive or extensive depending on the depth of planting medium and the amount of maintenance they need extensive green roofs traditionally support 10-25 pounds of vegetation per square foot 50120kgm239 while intensive roofs support 80-150 pounds of vegetation per square foot 390730kgm2.40 traditional roof gardens which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive requiring irrigation feeding and other maintenance intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from kitchen herbs to shrubs and small trees41 extensive green roofs by contrast are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance41 they can be established on a very thin layer of soil most use specially formulated composts even a thin layer of rockwool laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of sedum species and mosses some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements to protect the roof a waterproofing membrane is often used which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness ponding water high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots fungi and bacterial organisms42 advances in green roof technology have led to the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green roof types comprehensive green roofs bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green roofs together comprehensive green roofs support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green roofs at the depth and weight of an extensive green roof system43 another important distinction is between pitched green roofs and flat green roofs pitched sod roofs a traditional feature of many scandinavian buildings tend to be of a simpler design than flat green roofs this is because the pitch of the roof reduces the risk of water penetrating through the roof structure allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers historyedit re-creation of viking houses in newfoundland sod roofs on 18th-century farm buildings in heidal norway on the green roof of the mountain equipment co-op store in toronto canada modern green roofs which are made of a system of manufactured layers deliberately placed over roofs to support growing medium and vegetation are a relatively new phenomenon however green roofs or sod roofs in northern scandinavia have been around for centuries the modern trend started when green roofs were developed in germany in the 1960s and has since spread to many countries today it is estimated that about 10 of all german roofs have been greened25 green roofs are also becoming increasingly popular in the united states although they are not as common as in some parts of europe a number of european countries have very active associations promoting green roofs including germany switzerland the netherlands norway italy austria hungary sweden the uk and greece44 the city of linz in austria has been paying developers to install green roofs since 1983 and in switzerland it has been a federal law since the late 1990s in the uk their uptake has been slow but a number of cities have developed policies to encourage their use notably london and sheffield rooftop water purification is also being implemented in green roofs these forms of green roofs are actually treatment ponds built into the rooftops they are built either from a simple substrate as being done in dongtan45 or with plant-based ponds as being done by waterworks uk grow system46 and waterzuiverenbe47 plants used include calamus menyanthes trifoliata mentha aquatica etc48 several studies have been carried out in germany since the 1970s berlin is one of the most important centers of green roof research in germany particularly in the last 10 years much more research has begun about ten green roof research centers exist in the us and activities exist in about 40 countries in a recent study on the impacts of green infrastructure in particular green roofs in the greater manchester area researchers found that adding green roofs can help keep temperatures down particularly in urban areas adding green roofs to all buildings can have a dramatic effect on maximum surface temperatures keeping temperatures below the 19611990 current form case for all time periods and emissions scenarios roof greening makes the biggest differencewhere the building proportion is high and the evaporative fraction is low thus the largest difference was made in the town centers49 brown roofsedit industrial brownfield sites can be valuable ecosystems supporting rare species of plants animals and invertebrates increasingly in demand for redevelopment these habitats are under threat brown roofs also known as biodiverse roofs50 can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments with a layer of locally sourced material construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs the main difference being the choice of growing medium usually locally sourced rubble gravel soil etc to meet a specific biodiversity objective51 in switzerland it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations in london a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used the original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term such practices are derided by purists52 the roofs are colonised by spiders and insects many of which are becoming extremely rare in the uk as such sites are developed and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds laban a centre for contemporary dance in london has a brown roof specifically designed to encourage the nationally

grow plants on the roofs of buildings no soil is placed directly on the roof itself thus eliminating the need for an insulating layer instead plants are grown on wooden tables vegetables and fruit are the most popular candidates providing a fresh healthy source of food that is free from pesticides65 a more advanced method aquaponics being used experimentally in egypt is farming fish next to plants in a closed cycle this allows the plants to benefit from the ammonia excreted by the fish helping the plants to grow better and at the same time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish because the plants help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia the fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants franceedit green roof planted with native species at lhistorial de

traditions started in the early industrialization period more than 100 years ago exist in germany in the 1970s green roof technology was elevated to the next level serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions preferably with living plants modern green roof technology with high performance lightweight materials were utilized to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load in the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world in stuttgart with one of the most innovative department of parks and recreation and with the worlds oldest horticultural universities modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale with the first green roof industry boom in germany there were quality issues recorded the fll formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology fll stands for forschungsgesellschaft

oikostegi greek oiko pronounced eeko meaning building-ecological and stegi pronounced staygee meaning roof-abode-shelter was inaugurated in september 2008 studies of the thermodynamics of the roof in september 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation69 in further studies in august 2009 energy savings of 50 were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation the ten-floor building has a total floor space of 1.4 hectares the oikostegi covers 650m2 equalling 52 of the roof space and 8 of the total floor space despite this energy savings totalling 5,630 per annum were recorded which translates to a 9 saving in air conditioning and a 4 saving in heating bills for the whole building70 an additional observation and conclusion of the study was that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months between the first and second study this suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further the study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof such as butterflies honey bees and ladybirds obviously this was not the case before installation finally the study suggested that both the micro-climate and
