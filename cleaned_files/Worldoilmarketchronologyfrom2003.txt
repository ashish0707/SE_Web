not rise significantly the price increases have coincided with a period of record profits for the oil industrycitation needed between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors - exxonmobil total shell bp chevron and conocophillips - totaled 494.8 billion11 likewise major oil-dependent countries such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates canada russia venezuela and nigeria have

from the average in 2002.12 the 2003 invasion of iraq marked a significant event for oil markets because iraq contains a large amount of global oil reserves13 the conflict coincided with an increase in global demand for petroleum but it also reduced iraqs current oil production and has been blamed for increasing oil prices14 however oil company ceo matthew simmons emphasizes the peaking and decline of oil-exporting in mexico indonesia and the united kingdom is the reason for the price gouging according to simmons15 isolated events such as the iraq war affect short-term prices but do not determine a long-term trend simmons cites the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques in large fields such as mexicos cantarell15 which maintained production for a few years until it eventually declined pumping oil out of iraq may reduce petroleum prices in the short term but will be unable to perpetually lower the price from simmons point of view the invasion of iraq is associated with the start of long-term increase in oil prices but it may mitigate the decline in oil production by retaining a partial amount of iraqs oil reserves as a direct consequence the oil production capacity was diminished to 2 million barrels 320,000m3 per day16 2004 to 2008 rising costs of oiledit july 2006 san francisco california after retreating for several months in late 2004 and early 2005 crude oil

onwards the price elasticity of the crude oil market changed significantly before 2005 a small increase in oil price lead to an noticeable expansion of the production volume later price rises let the production grow only by small numbers this was the reason to call 2005 a tipping point17 after the destruction of hurricane katrina in the united states gasoline prices reached a record high during the first week of september 2005 the average retail price was on average 3.04 per us gallon18 the average retail price of a liter of petrol in the united kingdom was 86.4p on october 19 2006 or 6.13

traded for over usd 79 per barrel bbl21 setting an all-time record the run-up is attributed to a 1.9 increase in gasoline consumption geopolitical tensions resulting from north koreas missile launch the ongoing iraq war as well as israel and lebanon going to war are also causative factors the higher price of oil substantially cut growth of world oil demand in 2006 including a reduction in oil

reduce budget deficits if the european economy slowed down this would mean less demand for crude oil also if the european economic crisis caused the american economy to have problems demand for oil would be reduced further50 other factors included the strong dollar and high inventories according to the us energy information administration gas prices nationwide averaged 2.91 on may 10 dropping to 2.79 two weeks later the deepwater horizon oil spill was not a factor in gas prices since the well had not produced51 prices rose back to 90barrel in december 2010.52 the us average for a gallon of 87

supplies remained high and saudi arabia assured an increase in production to counteract shutdowns still the mideast and north african crisis led to a rise in oil prices to the highest level in two years with gasoline prices following though most libyan oil went to europe all oil prices reacted the average price of gasoline in the united states increased 6 cents to 3.17.54 on march 1 2011 a significant drop in libyan production and fears of more instability in other countries pushed the price of oil over 100 a barrel in new york trading while the average price of gas reached 3.37 despite saudi promises the sour type oil the country exported could not replace the more desirable sweet libyan oil55 on march 7 2011 the average price of gas having reached 3.57 individuals were making

and brent crude fell two percent64 however on june 29 west texas intermediate crude had risen to 94.96 almost 5 above the lowest point reached after the previous weeks action one reason was the falling dollar as greece appeared less likely to default on its debt concern over the greek debt crisis had caused falling oil prices6566 after another week oil for august delivery had risen from 90.61 to 98.67 and gas prices were up five cents increased worldwide demand was one reason67 brent crude remained high at 118.38 partly due to supply problems in europe including lower north sea
