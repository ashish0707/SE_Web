electricity production than brown coal in the first half of 2014.3 on sunday 15 may 2016 at 1400 hours renewables supplied nearly all of domestic electricity demand4 while peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a previous all-time high of 74 in april 2014,5 wind power saw its best day ever on december 12 2014 generating 562 gwh6 germany has been called the worlds first major renewable energy economy78 more than 23,000 wind turbines and 1.4 million solar pv systems are distributed all over the countrys area of 357,000square kilometers910 as of 2011 germanys federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization11 with a particular focus on offshore wind farms12 a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern parts of the country13 according to official figures some 370,000 people were employed in the renewable energy sector in 2010 especially in small and medium-sized companies this is an increase of around 8 compared to 2009 around 339,500 jobs and well over twice the number of jobs in 2004 160,500 about two-thirds of these jobs are attributed to the renewable energy sources act1415 germanys energy transition the energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy from 2011 the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units which

the end of 2014 renewable energy sources such as biomass biogas biofuels hydro wind and solar accounted for 11.1 of the countrys primary energy consumption a more than doubling compared to 2004 when renewables only contributed 4.5 renewable contribute most to the electricity sector with 27.8 gross-generation followed by the heat and transportation sector with 9.9 and 5.4 respectively245 although the terms energy and electricity are often used interchangeably they should not be confused with one another as electricity is only one form of energy and does not account for the energy consumed by

centre for forestry and forest products claims that there are also reserves which may assist in enlarging the part of forestry in biomass production agriculture is the main source of rapeseed oil which is used for the production of biodiesel and making substrates for the production of biogas35 biomass used for the production of biogas and biofuels are some of germanys most important sources of renewable energy in 2010 biomass accounted for 30 of renewable electricity generation and for 70 of all renewable energy mostly wood36 germany has committed to blending 6.25 biofuels in petroleum by

the total electricity demand was covered by solar power42 on saturday may 25 2012 solar power broke a new record high feeding 22 gw into the power grid or as much as 20 nuclear power stations this jump above the 20 gw level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide and made up for half of the nations electricity demand at midday43 germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar pv 2012 with 7.6 gw of newly connected systems44 some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25 by 2050.45 price of pv systems has decreased more

show in germany in 2007 about 9,400 people were employed in the hydropower sector which generated a total turnover of 1.23 billion47 geothermal poweredit main article geothermal power in germany geothermal power in germany is expected to grow mainly because of a law that benefits the production of geothermal electricity and guarantees a feed-in tariff but after a renewable energy law that introduced a tariff scheme of 0.15 us023 per kilowatt-hour kwh for electricity produced from geothermal sources came into effect that year a construction boom was sparked and the new power plants are

peter lscher believes germanys target of generating 35 of its energy from renewables by 2020 is achievable and most probably profitable for europes largest engineering company its environmental solutions portfolio which is firmly focused on renewables is already generating more than 27 billion a year 35 per cent of siemens total revenue and the plan is to grow this to 40 billion by 2015 ending its involvement in nuclear industry will boost the credibility of siemens as a purveyor of green technology49 germanys main competitors in solar electricity are japan the us and china in the wind industry it is denmark spain and the us government policyedit the renewable energy sector benefited when the alliance 90the greens party joined the federal government between 1998 and 2005 support for renewable energy continued under all following governments regardless of composition including the current cducsu and spd coalition government starting in 2013.19 the renewable energy sector was aided especially by the renewable energy sources act that promotes renewable energy mainly by stipulating feed-in tariffs and recently also market premiums that grid operators must pay for renewable energy fed into the power grid people who produce renewable energy can sell their product at fixed prices for a period of 20 or 15years this has created a surge in the production of renewable energy50 in 2012 siemens estimated the total cost of renewable energy would come to at least 1.4trillion us18trillion by 2030.51 for the 20112014 period the federal government set aside 3.5billion euros for scientific research in the country52 additionally in 2001 a law was passed requiring the closing of all nuclear power plants within a period of 32years the shutdown time was extended to 2040 by a new government in 2010 after the fukushima incident the law was abrogated and the end of nuclear energy was set to 2022.53 after the 2013 federal elections the new cducsu and spd coalition in important areas continued the energiewende of the previous government but also agreed on a major revision of the eeg54 the german energy policy is framed within the european union and the march 2007 european council in brussels approved a mandatory energy plan that requires a 20 reduction of carbon dioxide emissions before the year 2020 and the consumption of renewable energies to be 20 of total eu consumption compared to 7 in 2006.55 the accord indirectly acknowledged the role of nuclear energy which is not commonly regarded as renewable but emissions-free in the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases allowing each member state to decide whether or not to use nuclear-generated electricity56 also a compromise was reached to achieve a minimum quota of 10 biofuels in the total consumption of gasoline and diesel in transport in 2020 energy transitionedit main articles energy transition and energy transition in germany energiewende energy transition designates a

very small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency the key policy document outlining the

particularly wind power germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5 in 1999 to 22.9 in 2012 reaching close to the oecd average of 18 usage of renewables57 producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years guaranteeing a fixed income energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market nuclear power plants were closed and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned in 2022 in may 2013 the international energy agency commended germany for its commitment to developing a comprehensive energy transition strategy ambitious renewable energy goals and plans to increase efficient energy use and supported this approach nevertheless the scale of germanys energy policy ambitions coupled with the large size and energy intensity of its economy and its central location in europes energy system mean further policy measures must be developed if the countrys ambitious energy transition is to maintain a workable balance between sustainability affordability and competitiveness58 subsidies aimed at stimulating the growth of renewables have driven up consumer energy prices by 12.5 in 2013.59 to date german consumers have absorbed the costs of the energiewende but the iea says the debate over the social and economic impacts of the new approach has become more prominent as the share of renewable energy has continued to grow alongside rising electricity prices the transition to a low-carbon energy sector requires public acceptance and therefore retail electricity prices must remain at an affordable level presently german electricity prices are among the highest in europe despite relatively low wholesale prices58 at the same time the iea said the new energy policy is based on long-term investment decisions and a strong policy consensus in germany in favour of large-scale renewable energy commercialisation exists58 ownershipedit in germany almost half of renewable power capacity was citizen-owned as of 2013 and about 20 million germans lived in so-called 100 renewable
