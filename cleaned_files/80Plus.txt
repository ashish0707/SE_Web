80 plus logo 80 plus trademarked 80 plus is a voluntary certification program intended to promote efficient energy use in computer power supply units psus launched in 2004 by ecos consulting it certifies products that have more than 80 energy efficiency at 20 50 and 100 of rated load and a power factor of 0.9 or greater at 100 load such psus waste 20 or less electric energy as heat at the specified load levels reducing electricity use and bills compared to less efficient psus contents 1 history 2 efficiency level certifications 3 misleading power supply advertising 4 technical overview

test protocol for desktop derived multi-output power supplies march 2004 the 80 plus idea was presented as an initiative at the aceee market transformation symposium february 2005 the first market-ready power supply was created by seasonic 2006 energy star added 80 plus requirements to their then-upcoming in effect since july 2007 energy star 4.0 computer specifications november and february 2006 hp and dell certify their psus to the 80 plus specification 20 july 2007 energy star computer specification 4.0 goes into effect the specification includes 80 plus power supply efficiency levels for desktop computers december 2007 over 2001 psus on the market are 80plus certified and it is becoming the market standard first quarter 2008 standards revised to add bronze silver and gold higher efficiency level certifications october 2009 added specification for platinum efficiency level2 february 2012 dell and delta electronics working together were able to achieve world

next year target is 80 plus bronze level the following year 80 plus silver then 80 plus gold and finally platinum misleading power supply advertisingedit there have been instances where companies claim or imply that their supplies are 80plus when they have not been certified and in some cases do not meet the requirements6 when a company resells an oem power supply under a new name it must be certified under the new name and company even if the oem supply is certified6 in some instances a reseller has claimed a higher wattage than the supply can deliver in which case the resellers supply would not meet 80 plus requirements6 the 80 plus web site has a list of all certified supplies so it is possible to confirm that a supply really meets the requirements4 although some power supply manufacturers name their products with similar names such as 85 plus78 there is no such official certification or standard technical overviewedit the efficiency of a computer power supply is its output power divided by its input power the remaining input power is converted into heat for instance a 600-watt power supply with 60 efficiency running at full load would draw 1000w from the mains and would therefore waste 400w as heat on the other hand a 600-watt power supply with 80 efficiency running at full load would draw 750w from the mains and would therefore waste only 150w as heat for a given power supply efficiency varies depending on how much power is being delivered supplies are typically most efficient at between half and three quarters load much less efficient at low load and somewhat less efficient at maximum load older atx power supplies were typically 60 to 75 efficient to qualify for 80plus a power supply must achieve at least 80 efficiency at three specified loads 20 50 and 100 of maximum rated power however 80plus supplies may still be less than 80 efficient at lower loads for instance an 80plus 520 watt supply could still be 70 or less efficient at 60 watts a typical idle power for a desktop computer9 thus it is still important to select a supply with capacity appropriate to the device being powered it is easier to achieve the higher efficiency levels for higher wattage supplies so gold and platinum supplies may be less available in consumer level supplies of reasonable capacity for typical desktop machines typical computer power supplies may have power factors as low as 0.5 to 0.6.10 the higher power factor reduces the peak current draw reducing load on the circuit or on an uninterruptible power supply reducing the heat output of the computer helps reduce noise since fans do not have to spin as fast to cool the computer reduced heat and resulting lower cooling demands may increase computer reliability10 the testing conditions may give an unrealistic expectation of efficiency for heavily loaded high power rated much larger than 300w supplies a heavily loaded power supply and the computer it is powering generate significant amounts of heat which may raise the power supply temperature which is likely to decrease its efficiency since power supplies are certified at room temperature this effect is not taken into account5 80plus does not set efficiency targets for very low load for instance generation of standby power may still be relatively inefficient and may not meet requirements of the one watt initiative testing of 80plus power supplies shows that they vary considerably in standby efficiency some consume half a watt11 or less in standby with no load where others consume several times as much at standby12 even though they may meet higher 80plus certification requirement levels inefficiencies in generating standby power are magnified by the amount of time that computers spend turned off see alsoedit ac adapter
