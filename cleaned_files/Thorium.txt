radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a primordial element the other being uraniuma it was discovered in 1829 by the norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist morten thrane esmark3 and identified by the swedish chemist jns jacob berzelius who named it after thor the norse god of thunder a thorium atom has 90 protons and therefore 90 electrons of which four are valence electrons thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air forming the dioxide thorium is weakly radioactive all its known isotopes are unstable thorium-232 232th which has 142 neutrons is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium with six other natural isotopes occurring only as trace radioisotopes thorium has the longest half-life of all the significantly radioactive elements 14.05billionyears it decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium-228 228ra starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable lead-208 208pb thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the earths crust and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare earth metals thorium was once commonly used as the light source in gas mantles and as an alloying material but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in tig welding electrodes at a rate of 12 mix with tungsten4 it remains popular as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation thorium and uranium are the only significantly radioactive elements with major commercial applications that do not rely on their radioactivity thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors but

the actinide actinium to the left of the actinide protactinium and below the lanthanide cerium pure thorium is very ductile and as normal for metals can be cold-rolled swaged and drawn5 at room temperature thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure with lattice parameter a 508.42pm additionally it has two other forms at exotic conditions one at high temperature over 1360c body-centred cubic and one at high pressure around 100gpa body-centred tetragonal5 the properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample the major impurity is usually thorium dioxide tho2 the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide5 experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66gcm3 these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.724gcm3 calculated from thoriums lattice parameters perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast5 these values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium 10.07gcm3 and protactinium 15.37gcm3 showing the continuity of trends across the early actinides5 thoriums melting point of 1750c is above both that of actinium 1227c and that of protactinium approximately 1560c in the beginning of period 7 from francium to thorium the melting points of the elements increase following the trend in the other periods this is because the number of delocalised electrons that each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium and there is a greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one in francium to four in thorium after thorium there is a new smooth trend downward in the melting points of the early actinides from thorium to plutonium where the number of f electrons increases from zero to six due to the increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal6 among the actinides thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density second only to actinium its boiling point of 4788c is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points behind only osmium tantalum tungsten and rhenium5 thorium has a bulk modulus of 54gpa comparable to those of tin and scandium the hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire6 nevertheless while thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium it is harder than either of them6 thorium becomes superconductive below 1.4k.5 thorium can also form alloys with many other metals addition of small amounts of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors with chromium and uranium it forms eutectic mixtures and thorium is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium5 isotopesedit main article isotopes of thorium the 4n decay chain of 232th commonly called the thorium series although every element up to bismuth element 83 has an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes classically stable with the exceptions of technetium and promethium elements 43 and 61 all elements from polonium element 84 onward are noticeably radioactive of these thorium element 90 is the most stable closely followed by uranium element 92 the isotope 232th has a half-life of 14.05billionyears about three times the age of the earth and even slightly longer than the generally accepted age of the universe about 13.8billionyears as such 232th still occurs naturally today four-fifths of the thorium present at earths formation has survived to the present789 thorium and uranium are thus the most well-studied of all the radioactive elements10 the heaviest three primordial nuclides 232th 235u and 238u are the only isotopes beyond bismuth that have half-lives measured in billions of years thus they are the only such heavy isotopes to have survived since their production around ten billion years ago hence thorium and uranium are the only important primordial radioactive elements even then the half-life of 232th is only a billionth that of 209bi the last classically stable nuclide 232th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in significant quantities in nature today and thus thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element7 the reason for the existence of this island of relative stability at thorium and uranium where the longest-lived isotopes have half-lives of millions or billions of years is because the most stable isotopes of these elements have closed nuclear shells1112 nevertheless since thorium and uranium have more protons than bismuth their nuclei are thus still susceptible to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force is not strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons13 232th is the longest-lived isotope in the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4 hence the name it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor the chain begins with the alpha decay of 232th to 228ra and terminates at stable 208pb.7 232th very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals but the partial half-life of this process is very large at over 1021years and hence alpha decay predominates1415 because 232th is so long-lived its daughters still exist in nature as radiogenic nuclides despite their much shorter half-lives the longest among them being the 5.7-year half-life of 228ra the immediate alpha daughter of 232th any sample of thorium or its compounds contain traces of these daughters which are isotopes of thallium lead bismuth polonium radon radium and actinium7 as such natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides such as 212pb which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy1617 thirty radioisotopes have been characterised which range in mass number from 20918 to 238.14 the most stable of them after 232th are 230th with a half-life of 75,380years 229th with a half-life of 7,340years 228th with a half-life of 1.92years 234th with a half-life of 24.10days and 227th with a half-life of 18.68days all of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of 232th 235u 238u and 237np produced in minute traces in nuclear reactions in uranium ores all of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes7 in deep seawaters the isotope 230th becomes significant enough that the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013 as it can then make up to 0.04 of natural thorium with 232th being the remainder19 the reason for this is that while its parent 238u is soluble in water 230th is insoluble and thus precipitates to form part of the sediment and may be observed doing so uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230th isotope since 230th is one of the daughters of 238u.14 thorium thus has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition and so an atomic mass can be given which is 232.03774u thorium is one of only three significantly radioactive elements the others being protactinium and uranium that occur in large enough quantities on earth for this to be possible19 thorium also has three known nuclear isomers or metastable states 216m1th 216m2th and 229mth 229mth has the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer20 measured to be 7.60.5ev this is so low that when it undergoes isomeric transition the emitted gamma radiation is in the ultraviolet range212223b in the early history of the study of radioactivity the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names in this scheme 227th was named radioactinium rdac 228th radiothorium rdth 230th ionium io 231th uranium y uy 232th thorium th and 234th uranium x1 ux114 this reflects that 227th and 231th occur in the decay chain of natural 235u the actinium series 228th occurs in the decay chain of 232th the thorium series and that 230th occurs in the decay chain of 238u the uranium or radium series the remaining natural thorium isotope 229th occurs in minute traces as part of the decay chain of 237np the neptunium series which is much less abundant than the other decay chains in nature and was hence discovered much later therefore it does not have a historical name when it was realised that all of these are isotopes of thorium many of these names fell out of use and thorium came to refer to all isotopes not just 232th.14 the name ionium is still encountered for 230th in the context of ionium-thorium dating2526 different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically but have slightly differing physical properties for example the densities of isotopically pure 228th 229th 230th and 232th in gcm3 are respectively expected to be 11.524 11.575 11.626 and 11.727 the discrepancy between this and the previously mentioned theoretical value of 11.724 is because this does not refer to isotopically pure thorium but rather natural thorium which as noted above is a mixture of mostly 232th but also a little 230th.27 the isotope 229th is expected to be fissionable with a bare critical mass of 2839kg although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994kg.27c while 232th is not fissionable it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile 233u using neutron capture2728 radiometric datingedit two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes uranium-thorium dating involving the decay of 234u to 230th ionium and ionium-thorium dating which measures the ratio of 232th to 230th these rely on the fact that 232th is a primordial radioisotope but 230th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238u.29 uranium-thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234u and 230th relative to the age of the earth it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235u into 231th which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231pa and this process is often used to check the results of uranium-thorium dating uranium-thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral because while uranium is rather soluble in water thorium and protactinium are not and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments from which their ratios are measured the scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years2930 ionium-thorium dating is a related process which exploits the insolubility of thorium both 232th and 230th and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232th to 230th.2526 both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230th to 232th is a constant during the time period when the sediment layer was formed that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium and that the thorium cannot shift within the sediment layer2526 chemistryedit main article compounds of thorium reactions of thorium metal a thorium atom has 90 electrons of which four are valence electrons three atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy 5f 6d and 7s.31 despite thoriums position in the f-block of the periodic table it has an anomalous rn6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides thoriums 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects which are increasingly stronger near the bottom of the periodic table specifically the relativistic spinorbit interaction the closeness in energy levels of the 5f 6d and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four of its valence electrons and hence occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of 4 this behaviour is quite distinct from that of its lanthanide congener cerium for whom 4 is the highest possible state but 3 also plays an important role and is more stable therefore thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to its true lanthanide congener cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials and hence also in its chemistry1032 tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow like those of silver or lead as the th4 ion has no 5f or 6d electrons6 thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is slight enough to not pose major problems of handling and accessibility33 reactivityedit thorium is a highly reactive and electropositive metal finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its pyrophoricity and must therefore be handled carefully5 when heated in air thorium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide in bulk the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow although corrosion may eventually occur after several months most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide which greatly accelerates corrosion5 such samples slowly tarnish in air becoming grey and finally black at the surface5 at standard temperature and pressure thorium is slowly attacked by water but does not readily dissolve in most common acids with the exception of hydrochloric acid where it dissolves leaving behind a black insoluble residue probably thoohclh534 it dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions535 if these are not present passivation can occur similarly to uranium and plutonium536 inorganic compoundsedit thorium dioxide has the fluorite structure th4 __o2 __ most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may simply be prepared by heating the elements together37 in air thorium burns to form the simple dioxide tho2 also called thoria or thorina this has the fluorite structure38 thoria a refractory material has the highest melting point 3390c of all known oxides39 it is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases40 but dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride41 when heated it emits intense blue light through incandescence which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homologue cerium dioxide ceo2 ceria this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles40 several binary thorium chalcogenides and oxychalcogenides are also known with sulfur selenium and tellurium42 crystal structure of thorium tetrafluoride th4 __f __ all four thorium tetrahalides are known as are some low-valent bromides and iodides43 the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water44 additionally many related polyhalide ions are also known43 thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride where the th4 ions are coordinated with f ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms43 the other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry44 lower iodides thi3 black and thi2 gold can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal these do not contain thiii and thii but instead contain th4 and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds43 many polynary halides with the alkali metals barium thallium and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides chlorides and bromides43 for example when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid th4 forms the complex anion thf2 6 which precipitates as an insoluble salt k2thf635 thorium borides carbides silicides and nitrides are refractory materials as are those of uranium and plutonium and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels37 all four heavier pnictogens phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth also form binary thorium compounds thorium germanides are also known45 thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides thh2 and th4h15 the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.58k at standard temperature and pressure it conducts electricity like a metal46 they are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture37 coordination compoundsedit in acidic aqueous solution thorium occurs as the tetrapositive aqua ion thh2o94 which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry4748 at ph3 the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation47 the th4 ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14.47 it is quite acidic due to its high charge slightly stronger than sulfurous acid thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation though to a lesser extent than fe3 predominantly to th2oh26 in solutions with ph 3 or below but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide thoh4 is formed and precipitates out though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached because the polymerisation usually slows down significantly just before the precipitation this is different from the behaviour of zr4 and hf4 which do not hydrolyse appreciably in aqueous solution49 as a hard lewis acid th4 favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis10 large coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11 the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10 and the borohydride first prepared in the manhattan project has coordination number 14.49 the distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility not only in water but also in polar organic solvents6 many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known such as the perchlorates sulfates sulfites nitrates carbonates phosphates vanadates molybdates and chromates and their hydrated forms50 they are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste but most of them have not yet been fully characterised especially regarding their structural properties50 for example thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds50 thorium complexes with organic ligands such as oxalate citrate and edta are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes47 organothorium compoundsedit sandwich structure of thorocene piano-stool structure of 8-c8h8thcl2thf2 most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls like many of the early and middle actinides up to americium and also expected for curium thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex thc8h82 thorocene it is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound uranocene51 it can be prepared by reacting k2c8h8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran thf at the temperature of dry ice or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with mgc8h851 it is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190c.51 half-sandwich compounds are also known such as 8-c8h8thcl2thf2 which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran10 the simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are thc5h53 and thc5h54 many derivatives are known the former which has two forms one purple and one green is a rare example of thorium in the formal 3 oxidation state5152 a formal 2 oxidation state even occurs in a derivative53 the chloride derivative thc5h53cl is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with limiting kc5h5 used other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used the alkyl and aryl derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have received attention due to the insight they give regarding the nature of the thc sigma bond52 other organothorium compounds are not well-studied tetrabenzylthorium thch2c6h5 and tetraallylthorium thc3h54 are known but their structures have not yet been determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion thch373 heptamethylthorate which forms the salt

265.5276.5pm they behave equivalently in solution tetramethylthorium thch34 is not known but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands10 occurrenceedit main article occurrence of thorium formationedit 232th is a primordial nuclide having existed in its current form for over ten billion years it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r-process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovae54 the letter r stands for rapid neutron capture and occurs in core-collapse supernovae where heavy seed nuclei such as 56fe rapidly capture neutrons running up against the neutron drip line as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased coulomb barriers that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56fe is endothermic55 because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209bi the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create isotopes of thorium and uranium because all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements545657 estimated abundances of the 83 primordial elements in the solar system thorium is one of the rarest elements in the universe thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements it achieves this position not only because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process with the other one being uranium but also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed the only primordial elements rarer than thorium are thulium lutetium tantalum and rhenium the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals5455d furthermore neutron capture by nuclides beyond the end of the line of beta stability at a 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become thorium on earth thorium is much more abundant with an abundance of 8.1ppm in the earths crust it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements almost as abundant as lead 13ppm and significantly more abundant than tin 2.1ppm.58 this is because thorium being a lithophile is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core on the other hand the heavy platinum group metals have no affinity for oxygen and their oxides may even be thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements instead readily dissolve in iron and sink down with it into the core furthermore thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water59 on earthedit the radiogenic heat from the decay of 232th violet is a major contributor to the earths internal heat budget the other major contributors are 235u red 238u green and 40k yellow natural thorium is essentially isotopically pure 232th which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe14 its radioactive decay produces a significant amount of the earths internal heat the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial nuclides 235u 238u and 40k.60 the other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived of them only 230th is usually detectable occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238u and making up at most 0.04 of natural thorium14e on earth thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought having a crustal abundance comparable to that of lead and molybdenum twice that of arsenic and thrice that of tin62 thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals62 soil normally contains about 6 parts per million ppm of thorium63 in nature thorium occurs in the 4 oxidation state together with uraniumiv zirconiumiv hafniumiv and ceriumiv but also with scandium yttrium and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii62 because of thoriums radioactivity minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often metamict their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium64 an extreme example is ekanite cafepb2thusi8o20 which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition65 monazite is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide principally in india south africa brazil australia and malaysia it contains around 2.5 thorium on average although some deposits may contain up to 20 thorium6266 monazite is a chemically unreactive phosphate mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it62 allanite can have 0.12 thorium and zircon up to 0.4 thorium62 thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite which usually contains up to 12 tho2 due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the tho2 content62f thorite or tetragonal thorium silicate thsio4 also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered62 in thorium silicate minerals the th4 and sio4 4 ions are often replaced with m3 m sc y ln and phosphate po3 4 ions respectively62 because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released in significant quantities the th4 ion is soluble especially in acidic soils and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40ppm.67 historyedit tors fight with the giants 1872 by mrten eskil winge depicting an artists perception of thor the norse god of thunder raising his hammer in a battle against the giants68 in 1815 the swedish chemist jns jakob berzelius analysed an unusual sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in falun central sweden he noted impregnated traces of a white mineral which he cautiously assumed to be an earth oxide in modern chemical nomenclature of an unknown element by that time berzelius had already discovered two elements cerium and selenium but he had made a public mistake once announcing a new element gahnium that turned out to be simply zinc oxide69 berzelius privately named the supposed tentative element thorium in 181770 and its supposed oxide thorina after thor the norse god of thunder71 in 1824 after more deposits of the same mineral in vest-agder norway were discovered he retracted his findings as the mineral in question proved to actually be an yttrium mineral primarily composed of yttrium orthophosphate28697273 as the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element the mineral was named kenotime by the french mineralogist franois sulpice beudant as a rebuke of berzelius from the greek words vain and honour this became xenotime as a misprint from the beginning blunting the criticism697374 this misspelled form was later explained as being from stranger to and honour supposedly referencing the small rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as75 in 1828 morten thrane esmark found a black mineral on lvya island telemark county norway he was a norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist who studied the minerals in telemark where he served as vicar he commonly sent the most interesting specimens such as this one to his father jens esmark a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the university of oslo76 the elder esmark determined that it was not any known mineral and sent a sample to berzelius for examination berzelius determined that it contained a new element28 he published his findings in 1829 having isolated an impure sample for the first time by reducing kthf5 with potassium metal777879 berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery7780 thus he named the source mineral thorite which has the chemical composition thusio428 berzelius also made some initial characterisation of the new metal and its chemical compounds he correctly determined that the thoriumoxygen mass ratio was 7.5 its actual value is close to that 7.3 but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent and as such assumed that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen 120 amu while it is actually 15 times as largeg he determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal that he placed ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity81 berzelius did not isolate the element in its metallic state for the first time thorium was isolated in 1914 by d lely jr and l hamburger they obtained 99 pure thorium metal by reducing thorium chloride with sodium metal82h a simpler method leading to even higher purity was discovered in 1927 by marden and rentschler involving the reduction of thorium oxide with calcium when calcium chloride was present82 in dmitri mendeleevs 1869 periodic table thorium and the rare earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals this reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent with the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group iv in 1871 which contained the modern carbon group group 14 titanium group group 4 cerium and thorium because their maximum oxidation state was 4.8485 cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series while thorium remained with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group such as titanium and zirconium86i although thorium was discovered in 1828 it had no applications until 1885 when carl auer von welsbach invented the gas mantle a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of very hot thorium oxide heated to extremely high temperatures by burning gaseous fuels28 after 1885 many applications were found for thorium and its compounds such as in ceramics carbon arc lamps heat-resistant crucibles and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid world war ii thorium dioxide gas mantle in the late 19th century onward the atomic theory underwent significant improvements which shaped the further history of thorium thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898 independently by the german chemist gerhard carl schmidt and later that year the polish-french physicist marie curie it was the second element that was found to be radioactive after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by henri becquerel878889 between 1900 and 1903 ernest rutherford and frederick soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements this observation led to the identification of half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity90 the biological effect of radiation was discovered in 190391 the danger presented by radioactivity to health and environment was the reason thorium was phased out of use in applications that did not explicitly use the radioactivity28 by the 1930s it has been widely acknowledged that thorium possesses a minor threat to human organisms in large quantities in 1922 niels bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals which soon gathered wide acceptance the model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals84 such a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements with an atomic weight greater than bismuth thorium protactinium and uranium for example had been postulated as far back as 1892 by henry bassett who considered thorium and uranium to be members of a second series of rare earths and predicted that more elements would be found within this series most investigators considered on the basis of their chemical properties that these elements were analogous to the 5d transition elements hafnium tantalum and tungsten and considered the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row to be a one-off fluke the existence of a second inner transition series in the form of the actinides was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established92 it was only with the discovery of the first transuranic elements which from plutonium onward have dominant 3 and 4 oxidation states neptunium having 4 and 5 as dominant states and 7 as an unstable state that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals93 thus it was not until 1945 after glenn t seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium that seaborg realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium and filling a fourth d-block row86 today thoriums similarities to hafnium are still sometimes acknowledged by calling it a pseudo group-4 element94 despite thoriums radioactivity the element has remained in use for a long time for applications not exploiting the effect as no suitable alternatives could be found while a 1981 study estimated that a dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person9596 this was not the case for people manufacturing the mantles and thus contacting many as well as soils around some factory sites97 a major shift occurred as late as in the 1990s when most of these applications that do not depend on thoriums radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements have been found2898 due to concerns some manufacturers have switched to other materials such as yttrium although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient other manufacturers continue to make thorium mantles but moved their factories to developing countries96 as recently as 2007 some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity with some even fraudulently claiming them to be non-radioactive while in reality using large quantities of thorium up to 259milligrams per mantle9899 efforts have been applied to initiate usage of thorium and its radioactivity as a power source the earliest thorium-based reactor was made in india the first core at the indian point energy center in 1962.100 india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world but does not have much uranium used elsewhere and targeted in the 1950s at achieving energy independence for the country with their three-stage nuclear power programme101102 on the other hand in most countries the progress staggered because uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was therefore slow in the 20th century 3 reactors were opened in india and 12 elsewhere103 large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the international atomic energy agency iaea to study the use of thorium reactors a year later the us energy department began their research on the matter nuclear scientist alvin radkowsky of tel aviv university in israel the head designer of the american first civilian nuclear power plant at shippingport pennsylvania whose third core bred thorium104 founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors which included other companies raytheon nuclear inc and brookhaven national laboratory in the us and the kurchatov institute in russia105 in the 21st century thoriums potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle106107108 productionedit usgs estimates in tonnes 2011109 country reserves united states 440,000 australia 410,000 brazil 16,000 canada 100,000 india 290,000

thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the ph in sulfate solution110 in another extraction method monazite is decomposed with a 45 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140c mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first filtered at 80c washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid next the acidic solution is neutralised with hydroxides to ph 5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide thoh4 contaminated with 3 of rare-earth hydroxides the remaining rare-earth hydroxides remain in solution thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements an efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents110 thoh4 4 hno3 thno34 4 h2o metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide or chloride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere66 tho2 2 ca 2 cao th sometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700800c in a graphite crucible highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process111 since thorium has few applications today only a few hundred tonnes of it are produced each year mostly as a by-product of the production of uranium and the lanthanides and even these meagre quantities exceed the current demand for thorium112 half of this thorium produced is used in gas mantles nevertheless production could easily be increased and probably would be if thorium became used in large quantities as nuclear fuel66 present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively low-key exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand113 applicationsedit many applications of thorium are becoming obsolete due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products thorium is thus being phased out of many of its uses2898 thorium is used in gas tungsten arc welding gtaw to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability114 in electronic equipment thorium coating of tungsten wire improves the electron emission of heated cathodes34 thorium is added to tungsten because it lowers the effective work function with the result that the thoriated tungsten thermocathode emits electrons at considerably lower temperatures28 this is used in thoriated tungsten elements found in the filaments of vacuum tubes eg magnetron found in microwave oven many applications of thorium use rather than the metal its dioxide commonly called thoria in the industry the melting point of thoria is 3300c the highest of all known oxides only few substances have higher melting points39 this means that when heated to high temperaturesvague it does not melt but merely glows with an intense blue light addition of cerium dioxide gives a bright white light40 sometimes thorium nitrate is used instead because it will thermally decompose to thoria at high temperatures this property of thoria is used in mantles of portable gas lights including natural gas lamps oil lamps and camping lights115 additionally thoria is a material for heat-resistant ceramics as used in high-temperature laboratory crucibles28 yellowed thoria lens left a similar lens partially de-yellowed with ultraviolet radiation centre and lens without yellowing right when added to glass thoria helps increase refractive index and decrease dispersion such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments34 the radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film but the health risks are minimal116 yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state with lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation thoria has been used as a chemical catalyst in the conversion of ammonia to nitric acid28 in petroleum cracking and in producing sulfuric acid28 thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings it has an optical transparency in the range of 0.3512m and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material117 thorium tetrafluoride was also used in manufacturing carbon arc lamps which provided high-intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights115 potential use for nuclear energyedit main article thorium fuel cycle in thermal breeder reactors the fertilec isotope 232th is bombarded by slow neutrons undergoing neutron capture to become 233th which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first 233pa and then the fissile 233u28 232 90th n 233 90th 21.8 min 233 91pa 27.0 days 233 92u 1.59 105 y transmutation in the thorium fuel cycle 230th 231th 232th 233th white actinides t27d 231pa 232pa 233pa 234pa coloured t68y 231u 232u 233u 234u 235u 236u 237u fission products with t90y or t200ky 237np 233u is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more-commonly used 235u or 239pu when 233u undergoes nuclear fission the neutrons emitted can strike further 232th nuclei restarting the cycle28 this closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where 238u undergoes neutron capture to become 239u beta decaying to first 239np and then fissile 239pu.118 the main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer furthermore 232th absorbs neutrons more readily than 238u and not only does 233u have a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture 92.0 than 235u 85.5 or 239pu 73.5,119 it also releases more neutrons upon fission on average120 an added advantage 233u and 239pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei except the naturally occurring 235u is that they can be bred from neutron capture by the naturally-occurring quantity isotopes 232th and 238u.121122j thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing reactor core28 because thoria has a higher melting point higher thermal conductivity and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide uo2 thoria is also more chemically stable as unlike uranium dioxide it does not further oxidise to triuranium octoxide u3o8123 furthermore while a single neutron capture by 238u would produce transuranic waste along with it fissile 239pu five captures are generally necessary to do so from 232th 9899 of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233u or 235u so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced because of this thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide mox fuels to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium124 the main disadvantage is that it is difficult and dangerous to reprocess the used fuel because many of the daughters of 232th and 233u are strong gamma emitters120 additionally all 233u production methods other than mercury fluourescence always result in significant impurities of the very dangerous gamma emitter 232u either from parasitic n2n reactions on 232th 233pa or 233u that result in the loss of a neutron or from double neutron capture of 230th an impurity in natural 232th125 230 90th n 231 90th 25.5 h 231 91pa 3.28 104 y 231 91pa n 232 91pa 1.3 d 232 92u 69 y these impurities of 232u make 233u very easy to detect and very dangerous to work on and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using 233u as the fissile material125 additionally 233pa has a relatively long half-life of 27days and a high cross section for neutron capture thus it is a neutron poison instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233u a significant amount of 233pa converts to 234u and consumes neutrons degrading the reactor efficiency to avoid this 233pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation so that it only decays to 233u.126 another disadvantage of the thorium fuel cycle is the need to neutron-irradiate and process natural 232th before these advantages become real and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium nevertheless advances are being made in this technology28 another common criticism centres around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle127128129 some entities like the nuclear energy agency go further and predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundancea situation which trevor findlay predicts will persist in the coming decades130 furthermore though the isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are not transuranic some of them are still very dangerous such as 231pa which has a long half-life of 32760years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel126 toxicityedit radiologicaledit experiment on the effect of radiation from an unburned thorium gas mantle on the germination and growth of timothy-grass seed from popular science 1909 thorium is odourless and tasteless131 as thorium occurs naturally it exists in very small quantities almost everywhere on earth the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day of thorium132 this exposure is raised for people who live near uranium phosphate or tin processing factories thorium deposits radioactive waste disposal sites and for those who work in uranium thorium tin or phosphate mining or gas mantle production industries133 thorium is especially common in the tamil nadu coastal areas of india where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average134 when thorium is ingested 99.98 does not remain in the body out of the thorium that does remain in the body three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton while absorption through the skin is possible it is not a likely means of thorium exposure135 natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin as a result owning and handling small amounts of thorium such as those in a gas mantle is considered safe although usage of such items may pose some risks135 exposure to an aerosol of thorium such as contaminated dust can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung pancreas and blood as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation135 exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases136 because 232th is only mildly radioactive but decays to more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon emitting alpha and gamma radiation a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232th must include the contribution of its daughters such as 228ra which are dangerous gamma emitters137 there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles as the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thoria except of course 228th which is chemically identical to its parent 232th and they would be volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use for example during burning significant fractions of the thorium daughters 224ra 228ra 212pb and 212bi are released in the first hour of use alone138 most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram139 if a mantle is ingested 0.4 of the thorium and 90 of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body99 some nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about their use and have raised some safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal because while the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is136 chemicaledit the chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds mostly the dioxide are poorly soluble in water140 nevertheless some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic people who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis it can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves132 powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and often ignites spontaneously in air5 in the 1956 sylvania electric products explosion the burning of thorium metal powder sludge led to nine injuries some severe as well as one death from thorium poisoning141142143 notesedit bismuth is very slightly radioactive but its half-life is so long that its decay is negligible even over geological timespans gamma rays are distinguished by their origin in the nucleus not their wavelength hence there is no lower limit to gamma energy derived from radioactive decay24 a b a fissionable nuclide is capable of undergoing fission even with a low probability after capturing a high-energy neutron some of these nuclides can be induced to fission with low-energy thermal neutrons with a high probability they are referred to as fissile a fertile nuclide is one that could be bombarded with neutrons to produce a fissile nuclide critical mass is a mass of a ball of a material which could undergo a sustained nuclear chain reaction an even number of either protons or neutrons generally increases nuclear stability of isotopes compared to isotopes with odd such numbers for example elements with odd atomic numbers have no more than two stable isotopes while even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes with tin element 50 having the highest number of isotopes of all elements ten7 see even and odd atomic nuclei for more details other isotopes may occur alongside 232th but only in trace quantities if the source contains no uranium the only other thorium isotope present would be 228th which occurs in the decay chain of 232th the thorium series the ratio of 228th to 232th would be under 1010.14 if uranium is present tiny traces of several other isotopes will also be present 231th and 227th from the decay chain of 235u the actinium series and slightly larger but still tiny traces of 234th and 230th from the decay chain of 238u the uranium series14 229th is also been produced in the decay chain of 237np the neptunium series while all primordial 237np is extinct it is still produced today as a result of nuclear reactions in uranium ores61 229th is mostly produced as a daughter of artificial 233u itself produced from neutron irradiation of 232th due to its extreme rarity in nature14 thorianite refers to minerals with 75100moltho2 uranothorianite 2575moltho2 thorian uraninite 1525moltho2 uraninite 015moltho2.62 at the time the rare earth elements among which thorium was found and with which it is closely associated in the nature were thought to be divalent this is shown by the fact that the rare earths are there given atomic weight values two-thirds of their actual ones and thorium and uranium are given values half of their actual ones the main problem of isolating thorium lies not in its chemical electropositivity but in the close association of thorium in nature with the rare earth elements and uranium which collectively are difficult to separate from each other lars fredrik nilson the discoverer of scandium had previously made an attempt to isolate thorium metal in 1882 but was unsuccessful at achieving a high degree of purity83 thorium also appears in john newlands 1864 table as the last and heaviest element as it was initially thought that uranium was a trivalent element with an atomic weight of around 120 this is half of its actual value since uranium is predominantly hexavalent it also appears as the heaviest element in william odlings 1864 table under titanium zirconium and tantalum it does not appear in alexandre-mile bguyer de chancourtois 1862 gustav hinrichs 1867 or julius lothar meyers 1870 periodic systems that exclude the rare earths and thorium84 the thirteen fissile actinide isotopes with half-lives over a year are 229th 233u 235u
