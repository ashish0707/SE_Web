areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population iceland is volcanically and geologically active the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields mountains and glaciers while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate according to landnmabk the settlement of iceland began in the year 874 ce when the norwegian chieftain inglfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island8 in the following centuries norwegians and to a lesser extent other scandinavians immigrated to iceland bringing with them thralls of gaelic origin the island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the althing one of the worlds oldest functioning legislative assemblies following a period of civil strife iceland acceded to norwegian rule in the 13th century in 1814 it came under the rule of denmark during which a distinct icelandic national identity emerged this culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944 until the 20th century iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture and was among the poorest in europe industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world in 1994 it became a part of the european economic area which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance biotechnology and manufacturing iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd

scandinavians and their thralls many of whom were irish or scottish21 by 930 most arable land on the island had been claimed the althing a legislative and judicial assembly was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986.22 the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century23 at this time about 25 of iceland was covered with forest compared to 1 in the present day24 christianity was adopted by consensus around

was extensively forested in the late 12th century ari the wise described it in the slendingabk as forested from mountain to sea shore67 permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin volcanic soils and limited species diversity the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber64 deforestation climatic deterioration during the little

930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799 consequently it is arguably the worlds oldest parliamentary democracy82 it currently has 63 members elected for a maximum period of four years83 the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years with no term limit the elections for president the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years84 the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum the current president is guni th jhannesson the head of government is the prime minister who together with the cabinet is responsible for executive government the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing however the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944 but in 1942 regent sveinn bjrnsson who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941 appointed a non-parliamentary government the regent had for all practical purposes the position of a president and sveinn would later become the countrys first president in 1944 the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments with two or more parties involved as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholarswhich in iceland several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers but other provisions and traditions suggest differentlycitation needed in 1980 icelanders elected vigds finnbogadttir as president the worlds first directly elected

divisionsedit main article administrative divisions of iceland iceland is divided into regions constituencies and municipalities the eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division48 until 2003 the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions but by an amendment to the constitution they were changed to the current six constituencies reykjavk north and reykjavk south city regions southwest four non-contiguous suburban areas around reykjavk northwest and northeast northern half of iceland split and south southern half of iceland excluding reykjavk and suburbs the redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjavk city area the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system but still exists48 74 municipalities in iceland govern local matters like schools transport and zoning86 these are the actual second-level subdivisions of iceland as the constituencies have no relevance except
