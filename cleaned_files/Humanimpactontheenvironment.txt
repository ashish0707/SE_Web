often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts which according to the i pat equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit gdp environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons first given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit control or otherwise improve upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences6 second the conservation of mass principle and the first law of thermodynamics ie conservation of energy dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology environmental consequences are inescapable third according to the second law of thermodynamics order can be increased within a system such as the human economy only by increasing disorder or entropy outside the system ie the environment thus technologies can create order in the human economy ie order as manifested in buildings factories transportation networks communication systems etc only at the expense of increasing disorder in the environment according to a number of studies increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts78910 agricultureedit main article environmental impact of agriculture the environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world ultimately the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers the connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature there are two types of indicators of environmental impact means-based which is based on the farmers production methods and effect-based which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment an example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based11 the environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil to water the air animal and soil diversity plants and the food itself some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change deforestation genetic engineering irrigation problems pollutants soil degradation and waste fishingedit main article environmental impact of fishing fishing down the foodweb the environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught such as overfishing sustainable fisheries and fisheries management and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment such as by-catch and destruction of habitat such as coral reefs12 these conservation issues are part of marine conservation and are addressed in fisheries science programs there is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanitys desire to catch them a problem that gets worse as the world population grows similar to other environmental issues there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must reduce or even close13 the journal science published a four-year study in november 2006 which predicted that at prevailing trends the world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048 the scientists stated that the decline was a result of overfishing pollution and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed and many fishery management officials industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings although the debate continues many countries such as tonga the united states australia and new zealand and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources1415 irrigationedit main article environmental impact of irrigation the environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme the impacts stem from the changed hydrological conditions owing to the installation and operation of the scheme an irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area as a hydrological result it is found that the downstream river discharge is reduced the evaporation in the scheme is increased the groundwater recharge in the scheme is increased the level of the water table rises the drainage flow is increased these may be called direct effects effects on soil and water quality are indirect and complex and subsequent impacts on natural ecological and socio-economic conditions are intricate in some but not all instances water logging and soil salinization can result however irrigation can also be used together with soil drainage to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone1617 irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by tubewells as a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends the effects may be water mining landsoil subsidence and along the coast saltwater intrusion irrigation projects can have large benefits but the negative side effects are often overlooked1819 agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps dams and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers lakes and rivers as a result of this massive diversion of freshwater lakes rivers and creeks are running dry severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species20 agricultural land loss and soil erosionedit lal and stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year21 in contrast according to scherr glasod global assessment of human-induced soil degradation under the un environment programme estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by dudal and by rozanov et al22 such losses are attributable not only to soil erosion but also to salinization loss of nutrients and organic matter acidification compaction water logging and subsidence23 human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions focusing on soil properties oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded dregne and chou who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the worlds dry regions24 despite estimated losses of agricultural land the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9 from 1961 to 2012 and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.25 global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates usually by more than an order of magnitude26 in the us sampling for erosion estimates by the us nrcs natural resources conservation service is statistically based and estimation uses the universal soil loss equation and wind erosion equation for 2010 annual average soil loss by sheet rill and wind erosion on non-federal us land was estimated to be 10.7 tha on cropland and 1.9 tha on pasture land the average soil erosion rate on us cropland had been reduced by about 34 since 1982.27 no-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on north american cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley on uncultivated cropland the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 tha per year27 in comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation it has been suggested that because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture26 meat productionedit main article environmental impact of meat production environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy water and land resources greenhouse gas emissions and in some instances rainforest clearing water pollution and species endangerment among other adverse effects28 29 steinfeld et al of the fao estimated that 18 of global anthropogenic ghg greenhouse gas emissions estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents are associated in some way with livestock production28 a more recent fao analysis estimated that all agriculture including the livestock sector in 2011 accounted for 12 of global anthropogenic ghg emissions expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents30 similarly the intergovernmental panel on climate change has estimated that about 10 to 12 of global anthropogenic ghg emissions expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents were assignable to all of agriculture including the livestock sector in 200531 and again in 2010.32 the percentage assignable to livestock would be some fraction of the percentage for agriculture the amount assignable to meat production would be some fraction of that assigned to livestock fao data indicate that meat accounted for 26 of global livestock product tonnage in 2011 however many estimates use different sectoral assignment of some emissions 25 environmental specialists jeff anhang and robert goodland with the ifc and world bank have put the ghg associated with livestock at 51 pointing out the fao report failed to account for the 8,769 metric tons of respiratory co2 produced each year undercounted methane production and land use associated with livestock and failed to properly categorize emissions related to the slaughtering processing packaging storing and transporting of animals and animal products 33 34 globally enteric fermentation mostly in ruminant livestock accounts for about 27 of anthropogenic methane emissions35 despite methanes 100-year global warming potential recently estimated at 28 without and 34 with climate carbon feedbacks35 methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global warming over the decade 2000 through 2009 atmospheric methane content increased by an average of only 6 tg per year because nearly all natural and anthropogenic methane emission was offset by degradation while atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by nearly 15,000 tg per year35 at the currently estimated rate of methane degradation slight reduction of anthropogenic methane emissions to about 98 of that decades average would be expected to result in no further increase of atmospheric methane content although reduction of methane emissions would have a rapid effect on warming the expected effect would be small36 other anthropogenic ghg emissions associated with livestock production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption mostly for production harvesting and transport of feed and nitrous oxide emissions associated with use of nitrogenous fertilizers growing of nitrogen-fixing legume vegetation and manure management management practices that can mitigate ghg emissions from production of livestock and feed have been identified3738394041 livestock production including feed production and grazing uses about 30 of the earths ice-free terrestrial surface about 26 for grazing and about 4 for other feed production28 the intensity and duration of grazing use vary greatly42 and these together with terrain vegetation and climate influence the nature and importance of grazings environmental impact which can range from severe to negligible and in some cases as noted below beneficial excessive use of vegetation by grazing can be especially conducive to land degradation in dry areas43 considerable water use is associated with meat production mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed there are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated for example green water use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation and green water has been estimated to account for 94 of global beef cattle productions water footprint44 and on rangeland as much as 99.5 of the water use associated with beef production is green water however it would be misleading simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs even in the absence of cattle even when cattle are present most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control stabilization of soil structure nutrient cycling carbon sequestration support of numerous primary consumers many of which support higher trophic levels etc withdrawn water from surface and groundwater sources is used for livestock watering and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops whereas all irrigation in the us including loss in conveyance is estimated to account for about 38 of us withdrawn freshwater use45 irrigation water for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 946 other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector for drinking washdown of facilities etc is estimated at about 0.7.45 because of the preponderance of non-meat products from the livestock sector25 only some fraction of this water use is assignable to meat production impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern especially where intensive livestock production is carried out in the us in a comparison of 32 industries the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the clean water act and clean air act47 but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur various measures have been suggested by the us environmental protection agency among others which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments48 data of a usda study indicate that in 2002 about 0.6 of non-solar energy use in the united states was accounted for by production of meat-producing livestock and poultry49 this estimate included embodied energy used in production such as energy used in manufacture and transport of fertilizer for feed production non-solar energy is specified because solar energy is used in such processes as photosynthesis and hay-drying changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production as illustrated by some beef data in the us beef production system practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6 less fossil fuel use 16.3 less greenhouse gas emissions estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents 12.1 less withdrawn water use and 33.0 less land use per unit mass of beef produced than in 1977.50 from 1980 to 2012 in the us while population increased by 38 the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42 the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17 and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 1825 yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers us beef production increased over that period51 some impacts of meat-producing livestock may be considered environmentally beneficial these include waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food use of livestock as an alternative to herbicides for control of invasive and noxious weeds and other vegetation management52 use of animal manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those synthetic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for manufacture grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement53 and carbon sequestration in response to grazing practices5455 among others palm oiledit main article social and environmental impact of palm oil a village palm oil press malaxeur in bandundu democratic republic of the congo palm oil produced from the oil palm is a basic source of income for many farmers in southeast asia central and west africa and central america it is locally used as a cooking oil exported for use in many commercial food and personal care products and is converted into biofuel it produces up to 10 times more oil per unit area as soyabeans rapeseed or sunflowers oil palms produce 38 of vegetable oil output on 5 of the worlds vegetable-oil farmland56 palm oil is under increasing scrutiny in relation to its effects on the environment introductions and invasive speciesedit introductions of species particularly plants into new areas by whatever means and for whatever reasons have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas examples include the introduction of caulerpa taxifolia into the mediterranean the introduction of oat species into the california grasslands and the introduction of privet kudzu and purple loosestrife to north america rats cats and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands additionally introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place as with buffalo with domestic cattle and wolves with domestic dogs energy industryedit main article environmental impact of the energy industry the environmental impact of energy harvesting and consumption is diverse in recent years there has been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources in the real world consumption of fossil fuel resources leads to global warming and climate change however little change is being made in many parts of the world if the peak oil theory proves true more explorations of viable alternative energy sources could be more friendly to the environment rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation water and waste management and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of systems ecology and industrial ecology5758 biodieseledit main article environmental impact of biodiesel the environmental impact of biodiesel includes energy use greenhouse gas emissions and some other kinds of pollution a joint life cycle analysis by the us department of agriculture and the us department of energy found that substituting 100 biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95 biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45 compared with petroleum diesel in urban buses biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent and emissions of sulfur oxides 8 relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35 higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides nox were 13.5 higher with biodiesel59 life cycle analyses by the argonne national laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel compared with petroleum diesel use60 biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils eg canola or soybean oil is readily biodegradable in the environment compared with petroleum diesel61 coal mining and burningedit main article environmental impact of coal mining and burning the environmental impact of coal mining and -burning is diverse62 legislation passed by the us congress in 1990 required the united states environmental protection agency epa to issue a plan to alleviate toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants after delay and litigation the epa now has a court-imposed deadline of march 16 2011 to issue its report electricity generationedit main article environmental impact of electricity generation the environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power this power is normally generated at power plants that convert some other kind of energy into electricity each such system has advantages and disadvantages but many of them pose environmental concerns nuclear poweredit main article environmental impact of nuclear power the environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle processes including mining processing transporting and storing fuel and radioactive fuel waste released radioisotopes pose a health danger to human populations animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes radiation is a carcinogen and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems the environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the chernobyl disaster the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and the three mile island accident among others persist indefinitely though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators the radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope radioactive plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80.8 million years which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation63 oil shale industryedit main article environmental impact of the oil shale industry kivili oil shale processing chemicals plant in ida-virumaa estonia the environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as land use waste management and water and air pollution caused by the extraction and processing of oil shale surface mining of oil shale deposits causes the usual environmental impacts of open-pit mining in addition the combustion and thermal processing generate waste material which must be disposed of and harmful atmospheric emissions including carbon dioxide a major greenhouse gas experimental in-situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future but may raise others such as the pollution of groundwater64 petroleumedit main article environmental impact of petroleum the environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life climate change exists petroleum commonly referred to as oil is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities reservoirsedit main article environmental impact of reservoirs the wachusett dam in clinton massachusetts the environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases dams and the reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water generate hydroelectric power increasing the water supply for irrigation provide recreational opportunities and flood control however adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds less access to water downstream and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimentalto both the environment and surrounding human populations has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that in 1960 the construction of llyn celyn and the flooding of capel celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day more recently the construction of three gorges dam and other similar projects throughout asia africa and latin america have generated considerable environmental and political debate wind poweredit main article environmental impact of wind power wind turbines in an agricultural setting compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor wind powered electricity generation consumes no fuel and emits no air pollution unlike fossil fuel power sources the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months while a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use65 there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures the scale of the ecological impact may66 or may not67 be significant depending on specific circumstances prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs68 affect the siting and operation of wind turbines there are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine light pollutionedit main article ecological light pollution a composite image of artificial light emissions from earth at night artificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space69 the main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to lights use as an information source rather than an energy source the hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light changing predator prey interactions artificial light also affects dispersal orientation migration and hormone levels resulting in disrupted circadian rhythms70 manufactured productsedit cleaning agentsedit main article environmental

environmental impact including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized use of paints coatings painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred the united states environmental protection agency guidelines and green star ratings are some of the standards that can be applied paperedit main article environmental impact of paper a pulp and paper mill in new brunswick canada although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy a portion of it comes from burning wood waste the environmental impact of paper is significant which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels with the use of modern technology such as the printing press and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood paper has become a cheap commodity this has led to a high level of consumption and waste with the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by environmental organizations and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards sustainability in the pulp and paper industry pesticidesedit main article environmental impact of pesticides the environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is intended by those who use them over 98 of sprayed insecticides and 95 of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species including nontarget species air water bottom sediments and food71 pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks when it runs off from fields when it is discarded when it is sprayed aerially and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae72 the amount of pesticide that migrates from the intended application area is influenced by the particular chemicals properties its propensity for binding to soil its vapor pressure its water solubility and its resistance to being broken down over time73 factors in the soil such as its texture its ability to retain water and the amount of organic matter contained in it also affect the amount of pesticide that will leave the area73 some pesticides contribute to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer74 pharmaceuticals and personal care productsedit main article environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps is largely speculative ppcps are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons and the products used by agribusiness to boost growth or health of livestock ppcps have been detected in water bodies throughout the world the effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health75 miningedit main article environmental impact of mining acid mine drainage in the rio tinto river the environmental impact of mining includes erosion formation of sinkholes loss of biodiversity and contamination of soil groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes in some cases additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil76 besides creating environmental damage the contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect the health of the local population77 mining companies in some countries are required to follow environmental and rehabilitation codes ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state some mining methods may have significant environmental and public health effects transportedit main article environmental impact of transport interstate 10 and interstate 45 near downtown houston texas in the united states the environmental impact of transport is significant because it is a major user of energy and burns most of the worlds petroleum this creates air pollution including nitrous oxides and particulates and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide78 for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector79 by subsector road transport is the largest contributor to global warming78 environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission however this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles and more use of each vehicle78 some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied80 energy use and emissions vary largely between modes causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport and increase transport electrification and energy efficiency other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands by reducing transportation emissions globally it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on earths air quality acid rain smog and climate change81 the health impact of transport emissions is also of concern a recent survey of the studies on the effect of traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational duration and possibly also intrauterine growth82 aviationedit main article environmental impact of aviation the environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit noise particulates and gases which contribute to climate change8384 and global dimming85 despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines the rapid growth of air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation in the eu greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87 between 1990 and 2006.86 among other factors leading to this phenomenon are the increasing number of hypermobile travellers87 and social factors that are making air travel commonplace such as frequent flyer programs87 there is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account88 roadsedit main article environmental impact of roads the environmental impact of roads includes the local effects of highways public roads such as on noise light pollution water pollution habitat destructiondisturbance and local air quality and the wider effects including climate

organisation imo to rise by up to 72 by 2020 if no action is taken89 there is also a potential for introducing invasive species into new areas through shipping usually by attaching themselves to the ships hull the first intersessional meeting of the imo working group on greenhouse gas emissions90 from ships took place in oslo norway on 2327 june 2008 it was tasked with developing the technical

unknown perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction9293 some authors have postulated that without human interference the biodiversity of the earth would continue to grow at an exponential rate1 coral reefsedit main article human impact on coral reefs human impact on coral reefs is significant coral reefs are dying around the world94 in particular coral mining pollution organic and non-organic overfishing blast fishing and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are serious threats to these ecosystems coral reefs also face high dangers from pollution diseases destructive fishing practices and warming oceans95 in order to find answers for these problems researchers study the various factors that impact reefs the list of factors is long including the oceans role as a carbon dioxide sink atmospheric changes ultraviolet light ocean acidification biological virus impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far flung reefs pollutants algal blooms and others reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas general estimates show approximately 10 worlds coral reefs are already dead969798 it is estimated that about 60 of the worlds reefs are at risk due to destructive human-related activities the threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in southeast asia where 80 of reefs are endangered carbon cycleedit global warming is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum coal and natural gas and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests increased methane volcanic activity and cement production such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration extraction distribution refining and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices livestock contributes to climate change both thru the production of greenhouse gases and thru destruction of carbon sinks such as rain-forests according to the 2006 united nationsfao report 18 of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock the raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises so too will the demand for land ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock 99 potential negative environmental impacts
