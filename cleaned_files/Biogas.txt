phase-out green vehicle plug-in hybrid sustainable development portal renewable energy portal environment portal v t e biogas typically refers to a mixture of different gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen biogas can be produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste manure municipal waste plant material sewage green waste or food waste biogas is a renewable energy source and in many cases exerts a very small carbon footprint biogas can be produced by anaerobic digestion with anaerobic organisms which digest material inside a closed system or fermentation of biodegradable materials1 biogas is primarily methane ch 4 and carbon dioxide co2 and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide h 2s moisture and siloxanes the gases methane hydrogen and carbon monoxide co can be combusted or oxidized with oxygen this energy release allows biogas to be used as a fuel it can be used for any heating purpose such as cooking it can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat2 biogas can be compressed the same way natural gas is compressed to cng and used to power motor vehicles in the uk for example biogas is estimated to have the potential to replace around 17 of vehicle fuel3 it qualifies for renewable energy subsidies in some parts of the world biogas can be cleaned and upgraded to natural gas standards when it becomes bio-methane biogas is considered to be a renewable resource because its production-and-use cycle is continuous and it generates no net carbon dioxide organic material grows is converted and used and then regrows in a continually repeating cycle from a carbon perspective as much carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere in the growth of the primary bio-resource as is released when the material is ultimately converted to energy contents 1 production 1.1 dangers 2 landfill gas 2.1 technical 3 composition 4 benefits of manure derived biogas 5 applications 5.1 biogas

digestion biogas production in rural germany biogas is produced as landfill gas lfg which is produced by the breakdown of biodegradable waste inside a landfill due to chemical reactions and microbes or as digested gas produced inside an anaerobic digester a biogas plant is the name often given to an anaerobic digester that treats farm wastes or energy crops it can be produced using anaerobic digesters air-tight tanks with different configurations these plants can be fed with energy crops such as maize silage or biodegradable wastes including sewage sludge and food waste during the process the microorganisms transform biomass waste into biogas mainly methane and carbon dioxide and digestate the biogas is a renewable energy that can be used for heating electricity and many other operations that use a reciprocating internal combustion engine such as ge jenbacher or caterpillar gas engines4 other internal combustion engines such as gas turbines are suitable for the conversion of biogas into both electricity and heat the digestate is the remaining inorganic matter that was not transformed into biogas it can be used as an agricultural fertiliser there are two key processes mesophilic and thermophilic digestion which is dependent on temperature in experimental work at university of alaska fairbanks a 1000-litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from mud from a frozen lake in alaska has produced 200300liters of methane per day about 2030 of the output from digesters in warmer climates5 dangersedit the dangers of biogas are mostly similar to those of natural gas but with an additional risk from the toxicity of its hydrogen sulfide fraction biogas can be explosive when mixed in the ratio of one part biogas to 8-20 parts air special safety precautions have to be taken for entering an empty biogas digester for maintenance work it is important that a biogas system never has negative pressure as this could cause an explosion negative gas pressure can occur if too much gas is removed or leaked because of this biogas should not be used at pressures below one column inch of water measured by a pressure gauge frequent smell checks must be performed on a biogas system if biogas is smelled anywhere windows and doors should be opened immediately if there is a fire the gas should be shut off at the gate valve of the biogas system6 landfill gasedit main article landfill gas landfill gas is produced by wet organic waste decomposing under anaerobic conditions in a biogas78 the waste is covered and mechanically compressed by the weight of the material that is deposited above this material prevents oxygen exposure thus allowing anaerobic microbes to thrive this gas builds up and is slowly released into the atmosphere if the site has not been engineered to capture the gas landfill gas released in an uncontrolled way can be hazardous since it can become explosive when it escapes from the landfill and mixes with oxygen the lower explosive limit is 5 methane and the upper is 15 methane9 the methane in biogas is 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide therefore uncontained landfill gas which escapes into the atmosphere may significantly contribute to the effects of global warming in addition volatile organic compounds vocs in landfill gas contribute to the formation of photochemical smog technicaledit biochemical oxygen demand bod is a measure of the amount of oxygen required by aerobic micro-organisms to decompose the organic matter in a sample of water knowing the energy density of the material being used in the biodigester as well as the bod for the liquid discharge allows for the calculation of the daily energy output from a biodigester another term related to biodigesters is effluent dirtiness which tells how much organic material there is per unit of biogas source typical units for this measure are in mg bodlitre as an example effluent dirtiness can range between 8001200mg bodlitre in panamacitation needed from 1kg of decommissioned kitchen bio-waste 0.45 m of biogas can be obtained the price for collecting biological waste from households is approximately 70 per ton10 compositionedit typical composition of biogas compound formula methane ch 4 5075 carbon dioxide co 2 2550 nitrogen n 2 010 hydrogen h 2 01 hydrogen sulfide h 2s 03 oxygen o 2 00.5 source wwwkolumbusfi 200711 the composition of biogas varies depending upon the origin of the anaerobic digestion process landfill gas typically has methane concentrations around 50 advanced waste treatment technologies can produce biogas with 5575 methane12 which for reactors with free liquids can be increased to 80-90 methane using in-situ gas purification techniques13 as produced biogas contains water vapor the fractional volume of water vapor is a function of biogas temperature correction of measured gas volume for water vapor content and thermal expansion is easily done via simple mathematics14 which yields the standardized volume of dry biogas in some cases biogas contains siloxanes they are formed from the anaerobic decomposition of materials commonly found in soaps and detergents during combustion of biogas containing siloxanes silicon is released and can combine with free oxygen or other elements in the combustion gas deposits are formed containing mostly silica sio 2 or silicates si xo y and can contain calcium sulfur zinc phosphorus such white mineral deposits accumulate to a surface thickness of several millimeters and must be removed by chemical or mechanical means practical and cost-effective technologies to remove siloxanes and other biogas contaminants are available15 for 1000kg wet weight of input to a typical biodigester total solids may be 30 of the wet weight while volatile suspended solids may be 90 of the total solids protein would be 20 of the volatile solids carbohydrates would be 70 of the volatile solids and finally fats would be 10 of the volatile solids benefits of manure derived biogasedit high levels of methane are produced when manure is stored under anaerobic conditions during storage and when manure has been applied to the land nitrous oxide is also produced as a byproduct of the denitrification process nitrous oxide n2o is 320 times more aggressive as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide16 and methane 25 times more than carbon dioxide17 by converting cow manure into methane biogas via anaerobic digestion the millions of cattle in the united states would be able to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours of electricity enough to power millions of homes across the united states in fact one cow can produce enough manure in one day to generate 3 kilowatt hours of electricity only 2.4 kilowatt hours of electricity are needed to power a single 100-watt light bulb for one day18 furthermore by converting cattle manure into methane biogas instead of letting it decompose global warming gases could be reduced by 99 million metric tons or 4.19 applicationsedit a biogas bus in linkping sweden biogas can be used for electricity production on sewage works20 in a chp gas engine where the waste heat from the engine is conveniently used for heating the digester cooking space heating water heating and process heating if compressed it can replace compressed natural gas for use in vehicles where it can fuel an internal combustion engine or fuel cells and is a much more effective displacer of carbon dioxide than the normal use in on-site chp plants20 biogas upgradingedit raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60 methane and 29 co 2 with trace elements of h 2s it is not of high enough quality to be used as fuel gas for machinery the corrosive nature of h 2s alone is enough to destroy the internals of a plant2122 methane in biogas can be concentrated via a biogas upgrader to the same standards as fossil natural gas which itself has to go through a cleaning process and becomes biomethane if the local gas network allows the producer of the biogas may use their distribution networks gas must be very clean to reach pipeline quality and must be of the correct composition for the distribution network to accept carbon dioxide water hydrogen sulfide and particulates must be removed if present21 there are four main methods of upgrading water washing pressure swing adsorption selexol adsorption and amine gas treating23 in addition to these the use of membrane separation technology for biogas upgrading is increasing and there are already several plants operating in europe and usa2124 the most prevalent method is water washing where high pressure gas flows into a column where the carbon dioxide and other trace elements are scrubbed by cascading water running counter-flow to the gas this arrangement could deliver 98 methane with manufacturers guaranteeing maximum 2 methane loss in the system it takes roughly between 3 and 6 of the total energy output in gas to run a biogas upgrading system biogas gas-grid injectionedit gas-grid injection is the injection of biogas into the methane grid natural gas grid injections includes biogas25 until the breakthrough of micro combined heat and power two-thirds of all the energy produced by biogas power plants was lost the heat using the grid to transport the gas to customers the electricity and the heat can be used for on-site generation26 resulting in a reduction of losses in the transportation of energy typical energy losses in natural gas transmission systems range from 1 to 2 the current energy losses on a large electrical system range from 5 to 8.27 biogas in transportedit biogastget amanda the biogas train amanda train near linkping station sweden if concentrated and compressed it can be used in vehicle transportation compressed biogas is becoming widely used in sweden switzerland and germany a biogas-powered train named biogastget amanda the biogas train amanda has been in service in sweden since 2005.2829 biogas powers automobiles in 1974 a british documentary film titled sweet as a nut detailed the biogas production process from pig manure and showed how it fueled a custom-adapted combustion engine3031 in 2007 an estimated 12,000 vehicles were being fueled with upgraded biogas worldwide mostly in europe32 measuring in biogas environmentsedit biogas is part of the wet gas and condensing gas or air category that includes mist or fog in the gas stream the mist or fog is predominately water vapor that condenses on the sides of pipes or stacks throughout the gas flow biogas environments include wastewater digesters landfills and animal feeding operations covered livestock lagoons ultrasonic flow meters are one of the few devices capable of measuring in a biogas atmosphere most thermal flow meters are unable to provide reliable data because the moisture causes steady high flow readings and continuous flow spiking although there are single-point insertion thermal mass flow meters capable of accurately monitoring biogas flows with minimal pressure drop they can handle moisture variations that occur in the flow stream because of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations and account for the moisture in the flow stream to produce a dry gas value legislationedit european unionedit the european union has legislation regarding waste management and landfill sites called the landfill directive countries such as the united kingdom and germany now have legislation in force that provides farmers with long-term revenue and energy security33 united statesedit the united states legislates against landfill gas as it contains vocs the united states clean air act and title 40 of the code of federal regulations cfr requires landfill owners to estimate the quantity of non-methane organic compounds nmocs emitted if the estimated nmoc emissions exceeds 50 tonnes per year the landfill owner is required to collect the gas and treat it to remove the entrained nmocs treatment of the landfill gas is usually by combustion because of the remoteness of landfill sites it is sometimes not economically feasible to produce electricity from the gas global developmentsedit united statesedit with the many benefits of biogas it is starting to become a popular source of energy and is starting to be used in the united states more in 2003 the united states consumed 147 trillion btu of energy from landfill gas about 0.6 of the total us natural gas consumption32 methane biogas derived from cow manure is being tested in the us according to a 2008 study collected by the science and children magazine methane biogas from cow manure would be sufficient to produce 100 billion kilowatt hours enough to power millions of homes across america furthermore methane biogas has been tested to prove that it can reduce 99 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions or about 4 of the greenhouse gases produced by the united states34 in vermont for example biogas generated on dairy farms was included in the cvps cow power program the program was originally offered by central vermont public service corporation as a voluntary tariff and now with a recent merger with green mountain power is now the gmp cow power program customers can elect to pay a premium on their electric bill and that premium is passed directly to the farms in the program in sheldon vermont green mountain dairy has provided renewable energy as part of the cow power program it started when the brothers who own the farm bill and brian rowell wanted to address some of the manure management challenges faced by dairy farms including manure odor and nutrient availability for the crops they need to grow to feed the animals they installed an anaerobic digester to process the cow and milking center waste from their 950 cows to produce renewable energy a bedding to replace sawdust and a plant-friendly fertilizer the energy and environmental attributes are sold to the gmp cow power program on average the system run by the rowells produces enough electricity to power 300 to 350 other homes the generator capacity is about 300 kilowatts35 in hereford texas cow manure is being used to power an ethanol power plant by switching to methane biogas the ethanol power plant has saved 1000 barrels of oil a day over all the power plant has reduced transportation costs and will be opening many more jobs for future power plants that will rely on biogas36 in oakley kansas an ethanol plant considered to be one of the largest biogas facilities in north america is using integrated manure utilization system imus to produce heat for its boilers by utilizing feedlot manure municipal organics and ethanol plant waste at full capacity the plant is expected to replace 90 of the fossil fuel used in the manufacturing process of ethanol3738 europeedit the level of development varies greatly in europe while countries such as germany austria and sweden are fairly advanced in their use of biogas there is a vast potential for this renewable energy source in the rest of the continent especially in eastern europe different legal frameworks education schemes and the availability of technology are among the prime reasons behind this untapped potential39 another challenge for the further progression of biogas has been negative public perception 40 in february 2009 the european biogas association eba was founded in brussels as a non-profit organisation to promote the deployment of sustainable biogas production and use in europe ebas strategy defines three priorities establish biogas as an important part of europes energy mix promote source separation of household waste to increase the gas potential and support the production of biomethane as vehicle fuel in july 2013 it had 60 members from 24 countries across europe41 ukedit as of september 2013update there are about 130 non-sewage biogas plants in the uk most are on-farm and some larger facilities exist off-farm which are taking food and consumer wastes42 on 5 october 2010 biogas was injected into the uk gas grid for the first time sewage from over 30,000 oxfordshire homes is sent to didcot sewage treatment works where it is treated in an anaerobic digestor to produce biogas which is then cleaned to provide gas for approximately 200 homes43 in 2015 the green-energy company ecotricity announced their plans to build three grid-injecting digesters germanyedit germany is europes biggest biogas producer44 and the market leader in biogas technology45 in 2010 there were 5,905 biogas plants operating throughout the country lower saxony bavaria and the eastern federal states are the main regions46 most of these plants are employed as power plants usually the biogas plants are directly connected with a chp which produces electric power by burning the bio methane the electrical power is then fed into the public power grid47 in 2010 the total installed electrical capacity of these power plants was 2,291 mw46 the electricity supply was approximately 12.8 twh which is 12.6 of the total generated renewable electricity48 biogas in germany is primarily extracted by the co-fermentation of energy crops called nawaro an abbreviation of nachwachsende rohstoffe german for renewable resources mixed with manure the main crop used is corn organic waste and industrial and agricultural residues such as waste from the food industry are also used for biogas generation49 in this respect biogas production in germany differs significantly from the uk where biogas generated from landfill sites is most common44 biogas production in germany has developed rapidly over the last 20 years the main reason is the legally created frameworks government support of renewable energy started in 1991 with the electricity feed-in act streg this law guaranteed the producers of energy from renewable sources the feed into the public power grid thus the power companies were forced to take all produced energy from independent private producers of green energy50 in 2000 the electricity feed-in act was replaced by the renewable energy sources act eeg this law even guaranteed a fixed compensation for the produced electric power over 20 years the amount of around 8kwh gave farmers the opportunity to become energy suppliers and gain a further source of income49 the german agricultural biogas production was given a further push in 2004 by implementing the so-called nawaro-bonus this is a special payment given for the use of renewable resources that is energy crops51 in 2007 the german government stressed its intention to invest further effort and support in improving the renewable energy supply to provide an answer on growing climate challenges and increasing oil prices by the integrated climate and energy programme this continual trend of renewable energy promotion induces a number of challenges facing the management and organisation of renewable energy supply that has also several impacts on the biogas production52 the first challenge to be noticed is the high area-consuming of the biogas electric power supply in 2011 energy crops for biogas production consumed an area of circa 800,000 ha in germany53 this high demand of agricultural areas generates new competitions with the food industries that did not exist hitherto moreover new industries and markets were created in predominately rural regions entailing different new players with an economic political and civil background their influence and acting has to be governed to gain all advantages this new source of energy is offering finally biogas will furthermore play an important role in the german renewable energy supply if good governance is focused52 subcontinentedit biogas in india54 has been traditionally based on dairy manure as feed stock and these gobar gas plants have been in operation for a long period of time especially in rural india in the last 2-3 decades research organisations with a focus on rural energy security have enhanced the design of the systems resulting in newer efficient low cost designs such as the deenabandhu model the deenabandhu model is a new biogas-production model popular in india deenabandhu means friend of the helpless the unit usually has a capacity of 2 to 3 cubic metres it is constructed using bricks or by a ferrocement mixture in india the brick model costs slightly more than the ferrocement model however indias ministry of new and renewable energy offers some subsidy per model constructed lpg liquefied petroleum gas is a key source of cooking fuel in urban india and its prices have been increasing along with the global fuel prices also the heavy subsidies provided by the successive governments in promoting lpg as a domestic cooking fuel has become a financial burden renewing the focus on biogas as a cooking fuel alternative in urban establishments this has led to the development of prefabricated digester for modular deployments as compared to rcc and cement structures which take a longer duration to construct renewed focus on process technology like the biourja process model55 has enhanced the stature of medium and large scale anaerobic digester in india as a potential alternative to lpg as primary cooking fuel in india nepal pakistan and bangladesh biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of manure in small-scale digestion facilities is called gobar gas it is estimated that such facilities exist in over 2 million households in india 50,000 in bangladesh and thousands in pakistan particularly north punjab due to the thriving population of livestock the digester is an airtight circular pit made of concrete with a pipe connection the manure is directed to the pit usually straight from the cattle shed the pit is filled with a required quantity of wastewater the gas pipe is connected to the kitchen fireplace through control valves the combustion of this biogas has very little odour or smoke owing to simplicity in implementation and use of cheap raw materials in villages it is one of the most environmentally sound energy sources for rural needs one type of these system is the sintex digester some designs use vermiculture to further enhance the slurry produced by the biogas plant for use as compost56 to create awareness and associate the people interested in biogas the indian biogas association57 was formed it aspires to be a unique blend of nationwide operators manufacturers and planners of biogas plants and representatives from science and research the association was founded in 2010 and is now ready to start mushrooming its motto is propagating biogas in a sustainable way in pakistan the rural support programmes network is running the pakistan domestic biogas programme58 which has installed 5,360 biogas plants59 and has trained in excess of 200 masons on the technology and aims to develop the biogas sector in pakistan in nepal the government provides subsidies to build biogas plant chinaedit the chinese had experimented the applications of biogas since 1958 around 1970 china had installed 6,000,000 digesters in an effort to make agriculture more efficient during the last years the technology has met high growth rates this seems to be the earliest developments in generating biogas from agricultural waste60 in developing nationsedit domestic biogas plants convert livestock manure and night soil into biogas and slurry the fermented manure this technology is feasible for small-holders with livestock producing 50kg manure per day an equivalent of about 6 pigs or 3 cows this manure has to be collectable to mix it with water and feed it into the plant toilets can be connected another precondition is the temperature that affects the fermentation process with an optimum at 36 c the technology especially applies for those living in a sub tropical climate this makes the technology for small holders in developing countries often suitable61 simple sketch of household biogas plant depending on size and location a typical brick made fixed dome biogas plant can be installed at the yard of a rural household with the investment between us300 to 500 in asian countries and up to 1400 in the african context62 a high quality biogas plant needs minimum maintenance costs and can produce gas for at least 1520 years without major problems and re-investments for the user biogas provides clean cooking energy reduces indoor air pollution and reduces the time needed for traditional biomass collection especially for women and children the slurry is a clean organic fertilizer that potentially increases agricultural productivity61 domestic biogas technology is a proven and established technology in many parts of the world especially asia63 several countries in this region have embarked on large-scale programmes on domestic biogas such as china64 and india the netherlands development organisation snv65 supports national programmes on domestic biogas that aim to establish commercial-viable domestic biogas sectors in which local companies market install and service biogas plants for households in asia snv is working in nepal66 vietnam67 bangladesh68 bhutan
