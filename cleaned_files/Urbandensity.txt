urban density is a term used in urban planning and urban design to refer to the number of people inhabiting a given urbanized area as such it is to be distinguished from other measures of population density urban density is considered an important factor in understanding how cities function research related to urban density occurs across diverse areas including economics health innovation psychology and geography as well as sustainability contents 1 sustainability 2 measurement 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading 6 external links sustainabilityedit a graph showing the relationship between urban density and petrol use it is commonly asserted that higher density cities are more sustainable than low density cities much urban planning theory particularly in north america the uk australia and new zealand has been developed premised on raising urban densities such as new urbanism transit-oriented development and smart growthcitation needed however the link between urban density and aspects of sustainability remains a contested area of planning theorycitation needed1 jan gehl prominent urban designer and expert on sustainable urbanism argues that low-density dispersed cities are unsustainable as they are automobile dependent a minority such as randy otoole of the libertarian cato institute counter that raising densities results in more expensive real estate greater road congestion and more localized air pollution others counter that traffic congestion is a result not of population density but of parking capacity2 at a broader level there is evidence to indicate a strong negative correlation between the total energy consumption of a city and its overall urban density ie the lower the density the more energy consumed3 measurementedit urban density is a very specific measurement of the population of an urbanized area excluding non-urban land-uses non-urban uses include regional open space agriculture and water-bodies there are a variety of other ways of measuring the density of urban areas floor area ratio - the total floor area of buildings divided by land area of the lot upon which the buildings are built residential density - the number of dwelling units in any given area population density - the number of human persons in any given area employment density - the number of jobs in any given area gross density - any density figure for a given area of land that includes uses not necessarily directly relevant to the figure usually roads and other transport infrastructure net density - a density figure for a given area of land that excludes land not directly related to the figure weighted density - a density metric which measures the density at which the average citizen lives it is determined by calculating the standard density of each census tract assigning each a weight equal to its share of the total population and then adding the segments see alsoedit list of cities proper by population density transportation planning urban sprawl verticalization referencesedit jones christopher energy and resources group goldman school of public policy and department of nuclear engineering university of california berkeley california 94720 united states environ sci technol 2014 48 2 pp 895902 spatial distribution of us household carbon footprints reveals suburbanization undermines greenhouse gas benefits of urban population density environmental science and technology doi101021es4034364 retrieved december 13 2013 line feed character in date at position 170 help check date values in date help jacobsen shaun 2014-01-14 more density does not equal more car traffic transitized tall buildings dont create traffic cars create traffic if we want less automobile traffic on the streets we need to build less capacity for them including parking newman peter jeffrey r kenworthy 1999 sustainability and cities overcoming automobile dependence island press isbn1-55963-660-2 further readingedit newman p and kenworthy j 1999 cities and sustainability overcoming automobile dependence washington d c island press isbn 1-55963-660-2 pont meta y berghauser and haupt per 2010 spacematrix space density and urban form nai publishers isbn 9789056627423 dovey kim and pafka elek 2014 the urban density assemblage modelling multiple measures in urban design international vol19 nr 1 pg66-76 external linksedit mit density atlas urban density and energy consumption
