bavaria germany the nuclear reactor is contained inside the spherical containment building in the center left and right are cooling towers which are common cooling devices used in all thermal power stations and likewise emit water vapor from the non-radioactive steam turbine section of the power plant bohunice nuclear power plant in jaslovsk bohunice in slovakia a nuclear power plant or nuclear power station is a thermal power station in which the heat source is a nuclear reactor as is typical in all conventional thermal power stations the heat is used to generate steam which drives a steam turbine connected to an electric generator which produces electricity as of 23 april 2014update the iaea report there are 435nuclear power reactors in operation1 operating in 31countries.2 nuclear power stations are usually considered to be base load stations since fuel is a small part of the cost of production3 their operations and maintenance om and fuel costs are along with hydropower stations at the low end of the spectrum and make them suitable as base-load power suppliers the cost of spent fuel management however is somewhat uncertain contents 1 history 2 systems 2.1 nuclear

first time ever on september 3 1948 at the x-10 graphite reactor in oak ridge tennessee in the united states and was the first nuclear power station to power a light bulb456 the second larger experiment occurred on december 20 1951 at the ebr-i experimental station near arco idaho in the united states on june 27 1954 the worlds first nuclear power station to generate electricity for a power grid started operations at the soviet city of obninsk7 the worlds first full scale power station calder hall in england opened on october 17 1956.8 systemsedit bwr schematic pressurized water reactor this section has recently been translated from the german wikipedia the conversion to electrical energy takes place indirectly as in conventional thermal power stations the fission in a nuclear reactor heats the reactor coolant the coolant may be water or gas or even liquid metal depending on the type of reactor the reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam the pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine after the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam the remaining vapor is condensed in a condenser the condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a cooling tower the water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again the water-steam cycle corresponds to the rankine cycle nuclear reactorsedit main article nuclear reactor the nuclear reactor is the heart of the station in its central part the reactor cores heat is generated by controlled nuclear fission with this heat a coolant is heated as it is pumped through the reactor and thereby removes the energy from the reactor heat from nuclear fission is used to raise steam which runs through turbines which in turn powers the electrical generators nuclear reactors usually rely on uranium to fuel the chain reaction uranium is a very heavy metal that is abundant on earth and is found in sea water as well as most rocks naturally occurring uranium is found in two different isotopes uranium-238 u-238 accounting for 99.3 and uranium-235 u-235 accounting for about 0.7 isotopes are atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons thus u-238 has 146 neutrons and u-235 has 143 neutrons different isotopes have different behaviors for instance u-235 is fissile which means that it is easily split and gives off a lot of energy making it ideal for nuclear energy on the other hand u-238 does not have that property despite it being the same element different isotopes also have different half-lives a half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a sample of a radioactive element to decay u-238 has a longer half-life than u-235 so it takes longer to decay over time this also means that u-238 is less radioactive than u-235 since nuclear fission creates radioactivity the reactor core is surrounded by a protective shield this containment absorbs radiation and prevents radioactive material from being released into the environment in addition many reactors are equipped with a dome of concrete to protect the reactor against both internal casualties and external impacts9 steam turbineedit main article steam turbine the purpose of the steam turbine is to convert the heat contained in steam into mechanical energy the engine house with the steam turbine is usually structurally separated from the main reactor building it is so aligned to prevent debris from the destruction of a turbine in operation from flying towards the reactorcitation needed in the case of a pressurized water reactor the steam turbine is separated from the nuclear system to detect a leak in the steam generator and thus the passage of radioactive water at an early stage an activity meter is mounted to track the outlet steam of the steam generator in contrast boiling water reactors pass radioactive water through the steam turbine so the turbine is kept as part of the radiologically controlled area of the nuclear power station generatoredit main article electric generator the generator converts mechanical power supplied by the turbine into electrical power low-pole ac synchronous generators of high rated power are used cooling systemedit a cooling system removes heat from the reactor core and transports it to another area of the station where the thermal energy can be harnessed to produce electricity or to do other useful work typically the hot coolant is used as a heat source for a boiler and the pressurized steam from that drives one or more steam turbine driven electrical generators10 safety valvesedit in the event of an emergency safety valves can be used to prevent pipes from bursting or the reactor from exploding the valves are designed so that they can derive all of the supplied flow rates with little increase in pressure in the case of the bwr the steam is directed into the suppression chamber and condenses there the chambers on a heat exchanger are connected to the intermediate cooling circuit feedwater pumpedit the water level in the steam generator and nuclear reactor is controlled using the feedwater system the feedwater pump has the task of taking the water from the condensate system increasing the pressure and forcing it into either the steam generators in the case of a pressurized water reactor or directly into the reactor for boiling water reactors emergency power supplyedit most nuclear stations require two distinct sources of offsite power feeding station service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the stationss switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines in addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the stations house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars before they reach the step-up transformer these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power workers in a nuclear power stationedit nuclear engineers reactor operators health physicists emergency response team personnel nuclear regulatory commission resident inspectors in the united states and canada workers except for management professional such as engineers and security personnel are likely to be members of either the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew or the utility workers union of america uwua or one of the various trades and labor unions representing machinist laborers boilermakers millwrights iron workers etccitation needed economicsedit main article economics of new nuclear power plants the bruce nuclear generating station the largest nuclear power facility in the world11 the economics of new nuclear power stations is a controversial subject and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source nuclear power stations typically have high capital costs but low direct fuel costs with the costs of fuel extraction processing use and spent fuel storage internalized costs therefore comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear stations cost estimates take into account station decommissioning and nuclear waste storage or recycling costs in the united states due to the price anderson act with the prospect that all spent nuclear fuelnuclear waste could potentially be recycled by using future reactors generation iv reactors are being designed to completely close the nuclear fuel cycle presently however there has not yet been any actual bulk recycling of waste from a npp and on-site temporary storage is still being used at almost all plant sites due to waste repository construction problems only finland has stable repository plans therefore from a world-wide perspective long-term waste storage costs are uncertain nuclear reactors in operation releasing hot steam as a side product on the other hand construction or capital cost aside measures to mitigate global warming such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading increasingly favor the economics of nuclear power further efficiencies are hoped to be achieved through more advanced reactor designs generation iii reactors promise to be at least 17 more fuel efficient and have lower capital costs while futuristic generation iv reactors promise 10000-30000 greater fuel efficiency and the elimination of nuclear waste in eastern europe a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania and some potential backers have pulled out12 where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects12 analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties to date all operating nuclear power stations were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies13 where many of the risks associated with construction costs operating performance fuel price and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered are borne by station suppliers and operators rather than consumers which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power stations14 following the 2011 fukushima i nuclear accidents costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power stations due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats15 however many designs such as the currently under construction ap1000 use passive nuclear safety cooling systems unlike those of fukushima i which required active cooling systems this largely eliminates the necessity to spend more on redundant back up safety equipment safety and accidentsedit main articles nuclear safety and security and nuclear_power_plant_safety_and_security in his book normal accidents charles perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into societys complex and tightly-coupled nuclear reactor systems such accidents are unavoidable and cannot be designed around16 an interdisciplinary team from mit has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 2055 at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period1718 however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970.1920 to date there have been five serious accidents core damage in the world since 1970 one at three mile island in 1979 one at chernobyl in 1986 and three at fukushima-daiichi in 2011 corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation ii reactors this leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwidecitation needed nuclear power plants cannot explode like a nuclear bomb because the fuel for uranium reactors is not enriched enough and nuclear weapons require precision explosives to force fuel into a small enough volume to go supercritical most reactors require continuous temperature control to prevent a core meltdown which has occurred on a few occasions through accident or natural disaster releasing radiation and making the surrounding area uninhabitable modern nuclear reactor designs however have had numerous safety improvements since the first generation nuclear reactors plants must be defended against theft of nuclear material for example to make a dirty bomb and attack by enemy military which has occurred planes or missiles or planes hijacked by terrorists controversyedit main article nuclear power debate the abandoned city of prypiat ukraine following the chernobyl disaster the chernobyl nuclear power station is in the background the nuclear power debate is about the controversy21222324 which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes the debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s when it reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies in some countries2526 proponents argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels27 proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most western countries they emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants28 opponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment these threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining processing and transport the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste293031 the environment issue is also regarding discharge of hot water into the sea the hot water modifies the environmental conditions for the marine flora fauna they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong and there have been many serious nuclear accidents3233 critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology34 they argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source353637 reprocessingedit main article nuclear reprocessing nuclear reprocessing technology was developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel38 reprocessing serves multiple purposes whose relative importance has changed over time originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons with the commercialization of nuclear power the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into mox nuclear fuel for thermal reactors39 the reprocessed uranium which constitutes the bulk of the spent fuel material can in principle also be re-used as fuel but that is only economic when uranium prices are high or disposal is expensive finally the breeder reactor can employ not only the recycled plutonium and uranium in spent fuel but all the actinides closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by more than 60 times40 nuclear reprocessing reduces the volume of high-level waste but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism the political challenges of repository siting a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle41 in the united states the obama administration stepped back from president bushs plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research42 accident indemnificationedit the vienna convention on civil liability for nuclear damage puts in place an international framework for nuclear liability43 however states with a majority of the worlds nuclear power stations including the us russia china and japan are not party to international nuclear liability conventions in the us insurance for nuclear or radiological incidents is covered for facilities licensed through 2025 by the price-anderson nuclear industries indemnity act under the energy policy of the united kingdom through its nuclear installations act of 1965 liability is governed for nuclear damage for which a uk nuclear licensee is responsible the act requires compensation to be paid for damage up to a limit of 150 million by the liable operator for ten years after the incident between ten and thirty years afterwards the government meets this obligation the government is also liable for additional limited cross-border liability about 300 million under international conventions paris convention on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy and brussels convention supplementary to the paris convention44 decommissioningedit main article nuclear decommissioning nuclear decommissioning is the dismantling of a nuclear power station and decontamination of the site to a state no longer requiring protection from radiation for the general public the main difference from the dismantling of other power stations is the presence of radioactive material that requires special precautions to remove and safely relocate to a waste repository warranty period of operation of nuclear power stations is 30 years45 one of the wear factors is the deterioration of the reactors shell under the action of neutron bombardment45 generally speaking nuclear stations were designed for a life of about 30years.46 newer stations are designed for a 40 to 60-year operating life47 decommissioning involves many administrative and technical actions it includes all clean-up of radioactivity and progressive demolition of the station once a facility is decommissioned there should no longer be any danger of a radioactive accident or to any persons visiting it after a facility has been completely decommissioned it is released from regulatory control and the licensee of the station no longer has responsibility for its nuclear safety historic accidentsedit main article nuclear power accidents by country the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in japan the worst nuclear accident in 25 years displaced 50,000 households after radiation leaked into the air soil and sea48 radiation checks led to bans of some shipments of vegetables and fish49 the nuclear industry says that new technology and oversight have made nuclear station much safer but 57 small accidents have occurred since the chernobyl disaster in 1986 until 2008 two thirds of these mishaps occurred in the us17 the french atomic energy agency cea has concluded that technical innovation cannot eliminate the risk of human errors in nuclear station operationcitation needed according to benjamin sovacool an interdisciplinary team from mit in 2003 estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 2055 at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period17 however the mit study does not take into account improvements in safety since 1970.1920 flexibility of nuclear power stationsedit nuclear stations are used primarily for base load because of economic considerations the fuel cost of operations for a nuclear station is smaller than the fuel cost for operation of coal or gas plants there is no cost saving if you run a nuclear station at less than full capacitycitation needed however nuclear stations are routinely used in load following mode on a large scale in france although it is generally accepted that this is not an ideal economic situation for nuclear stations50 unita at the german biblis nuclear power plant is designed to in- and decrease its output 15 per minute between 40 and 100 of its nominal power51 boiling water reactors normally have load-following capability implemented by varying the recirculation water flowcitation needed future power stationsedit a new generation of designs for nuclear power stations known as the generation iv reactors are the subject of active research many of these new designs specifically attempt to make fission reactors cleaner safer andor less of a risk to the proliferation of nuclear weapons passively safe stations such as the esbwr are available to be built52 and other reactors that are designed to be nearly fool-proof are being pursued53 fusion reactors which are still in the early stages of development diminish or eliminate some of the risks associated with nuclear fission54 two 1600 mwe european pressurized reactors eprs are being built in europe and two are being built in china the reactors are a joint effort of french areva and german siemens ag and will be the largest reactors in the world one epr is in olkiluoto finland as part of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant the reactor was originally scheduled to go online in 2009 but has been repeatedly delayed5556 and as of september 2014 has been pushed back to 2018.57 preparatory work for the epr at the flamanville nuclear power plant in flamanville manche france was started in 2006 with a scheduled completion date of 2012.58 the french reactor has also been delayed and was projected in 2013 to launch in 2016.5960 the two chinese eprs are part of the taishan nuclear power plant in taishan guangdong the taishan reactors were scheduled to go online in 2014 and 2015,61 but that has been delayed to 2017.62 as of march 2007update there are seven nuclear power stations under construction in india and five in china63 in november 2011 gulf power stated that by the end of 2012 it hopes to finish buying off 4000 acres of land north of pensacola florida in order to build a possible nuclear power station64 in 2010 russia launched a floating nuclear power station the 100 million vessel the akademik lomonosov is the first of seven stations that will bring vital energy resources to remote russian regions65 by 2025 southeast asia nations would have a total of 29 nuclear power stations indonesia will have 4 nuclear power stations malaysia 4 thailand 5 and vietnam 16 from nothing at all in 2011.66 in 2013 china had 3267 nuclear reactors under construction the highest number in the world expansion at two nuclear power stations in the united states vogtle and v c summer nuclear power station located in georgia and south carolina respectively are scheduled to be completed between 2016 and 2019 the two new vogtle reactors and the two new reactors at virgil c summer nuclear station represent the first nuclear power construction projects in the united states since the three mile island nuclear accident in 1979 several countries have begun thorium-based nuclear power programs thorium is four times more abundant within nature than uranium over 60 of thoriums ore monazite is found in five countries australia the united states india brazil and norway these thorium resources are enough to power current energy needs for thousands of years68 the thorium fuel cycle is able to
