are intentional communities whose goal is to become more socially economically and ecologically sustainable most range from a population of 50 to 150 individuals although some are smaller and larger ecovillages of up to 2,000 individuals exist as networks of smaller subcommunities certain ecovillages have grown by the addition of individuals families or other small groups who are not necessarily members settling on the periphery of the ecovillage and effectively participating in the ecovillage community ecovillagers are united by shared ecological social-economic and cultural-spiritual values1 concretely ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical water transportation and waste-treatment systems as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community wasteful consumerist lifestyles the destruction of natural habitat urban sprawl factory farming and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life ecovillages offer small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact or regenerative impacts as an alternative however such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own see global ecovillage network for an example this model of collective action is similar to that of ten thousand villages which supports the fair trade of goods worldwide contents 1 definition 2 history 3 governance 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links definitionedit in 1991 robert gilman set out a definition of an ecovillage that became standard gilman defined an ecovillage as a human-scale full-featured settlement in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world in a way that is supportive of healthy human development and can be successfully continued into the indefinite future2 in recent years gilman has stated that he would also add the criterion that an ecovillage must have multiple centres of initiative3 kosha joubert president of the global ecovillage network more recently has defined an ecovillage as an intentional or traditional community consciously designed by its inhabitants in which people consciously value what they have and integrate this with innovative technologies to make their lives more sustainable and the whole process is owned by the people living there the aim is to regenerate social and natural environments in this view achieving sustainability is not enough it is vital also to regenerate the social and environmental fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability social environmental economic and cultural4 eco-villages have developed in recent years as technology has improved so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by baydoun m 2013 historyedit the modern-day desire for community was most notably characterized by the communal movement of the 1960s and 1970s which became more focused and organized in the cohousing and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s then in 1991 robert gilman and diane gilman co-authored a germinal study called ecovillages and sustainable communities for gaia trust in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together the ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of findhorn in scotland in 1995 the conference was called ecovillages and sustainable communities and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants according to ross jackson somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide the word ecovillage thus became part of the language of the cultural creatives5 after that conference many intentional communities including findhorn began calling themselves ecovillages giving birth to a new movement the global ecovillage network formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the findhorn conference crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world who had with similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other gaia trust denmark agreed to fund the network for its first five years5 today there are self-identified ecovillages in over 70 countries on six continents6 since the 1995 conference a number of the early members of the global ecovillage network have tried other approaches to eco-village building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted one of these with some degree of success is living villages and the wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximised and residents have shared food growing areas woodland and animal husbandry for greater sustainability the principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to urban and rural settings as well as to developing and developed countries advocates seek a sustainable lifestyle for example of voluntary simplicity for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area or ecoregion many advocates also seek independence from existing infrastructures although others particularly in more urban settings pursue more integration with existing infrastructure rural ecovillages are usually based on organic farming permaculture and other approaches which promote ecosystem function and biodiversity7 ecovillages whether urban or rural tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability such as permaculture design8 johnathan dawson former president of the global ecovillage network describes five ecovillage principles in his 2006 book ecovillages new frontiers for sustainability they are not government-sponsored projects but grassroots initiatives their residents value and practice community living their residents are not overly dependent on government corporate or other centralized sources for water food shelter power and other basic necessities rather they attempt to provide these resources themselves their residents have a strong sense of shared values often characterized in spiritual terms they often serve as research and demonstration sites offering educational experiences for others6 the imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns in particular automobile-enabled suburban sprawl was brought into focus by the energy crises of the 1970s the term eco-village was introduced by georgia institute of technology professor george ramsey in a 1978 address passive energy applications for the built environment to the first world energy conference of the association of energy engineers9 to describe small-scale car-free close-in developments including suburban infill arguing that the great energy waste in the united states is not in its technology it is in its lifestyle and concept of living10 ramseys article includes a sketch for a self-sufficient pedestrian solar village by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today governanceedit effective government is important to eco-villages it provides education charity for promotion in sustainable lifestyleclarification needed - much in this section is unclear or poorly phrased cunningham and wearing 2013 while the first generation of ecovillagers tended to adopt consensus decision-making as a governance method some difficulties with consensus as an everyday decision-making method emerged it can be extremely time-intensive and decisions too often could be blocked by a few intransigent members11 more recently many ecovillages have moved toward sociocracy and related alternative decision-making methods12 also ecovillages look for alternative government which emphasis on deeper connections with ecology than economy see alsoedit wikimedia commons has media related to ecovillage sustainable development
