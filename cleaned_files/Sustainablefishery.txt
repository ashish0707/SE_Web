seawifs map showing the levels of primary production in the worlds oceans a conventional idea of a sustainable fishery is that it is one that is harvested at a sustainable rate where the fish population does not decline over time because of fishing practices sustainability in fisheries combines theoretical disciplines such as the population dynamics of fisheries with practical strategies such as avoiding overfishing through techniques such as individual fishing quotas curtailing destructive and illegal fishing practices by lobbying for appropriate law and policy setting up protected areas restoring collapsed fisheries incorporating all externalities involved in harvesting marine ecosystems into fishery economics educating stakeholders and the wider public and developing independent certification programs some primary concerns around sustainability are that heavy fishing pressures such as overexploitation and growth or recruitment overfishing will result in the loss of significant potential yield that stock structure will erode to the point where it loses diversity and resilience to environmental fluctuations that ecosystems and their economic infrastructures will cycle between collapse and recovery with each cycle less productive than its predecessor and that changes will occur in the trophic balance fishing down marine food webs1 contents 1 overview 2

overviewedit sustainable management of fisheries cannot be achieved without an acceptance that the long-term goals of fisheries management are the same as those of environmental conservation daniel pauly and dave preikshot 2 global wild fisheries are believed to have peaked and begun a decline with valuable habitats such as estuaries and coral reefs in critical condition3 current aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish such as salmon does not solve the problem because farmed piscivores are fed products from wild fish such as forage fish salmon farming also has major negative impacts on wild salmon45 fish that occupy the higher trophic levels are less efficient sources of food energy fishery ecosystems are an important subset of the wider marine environment this article documents the views of fisheries scientists and marine conservationists about innovative approaches towards sustainable fisheries historyedit in the end we will conserve only what we love we will love only what we understand and we will understand only what we are taught senegalese conservationist baba dioum 6 in his 1883 inaugural address to the international fisheries exhibition in london thomas huxley asserted that overfishing or permanent exhaustion was scientifically impossible and stated that probably all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible7 in reality by 1883 marine fisheries were already collapsing the united states fish commission was established 12 years earlier for the purpose of finding why fisheries in new england were declining at the time of huxleys address the atlantic halibut fishery had already collapsed and has never recovered8 traditional management of fisheriesedit traditionally fisheries management and the science underpinning it was distorted by its narrow focus on target populations and the corresponding failure to account for ecosystem effects leading to declines of species abundance and diversity and by perceiving the fishing industry as the sole legitimate user in effect the owner of marine living resources historically stock assessment scientists usually worked in government laboratories and considered their work to be providing services to the fishing industry these scientists dismissed conservation issues and distanced themselves from the scientists and the science that raised the issues this happened even as commercial fish stocks deteriorated and even though many governments were signatories to binding conservation agreements2 defining sustainabilityedit the notion of sustainable development is sometimes regarded as an unattainable even illogical notion because development inevitably depletes and degrades the environment9 ray hilborn of the university of washington distinguishes three ways of defining a sustainable fishery long term constant yield is the idea that undisturbed nature establishes a steady state that changes little over time properly done fishing at up to maximum sustainable yield allows nature to adjust to a new steady state without compromising future harvests however this view is naive because constancy is not an attribute of marine ecosystems which dooms this approach stock abundance fluctuates naturally changing the potential yield over short and long term periods1 preserving intergenerational equity acknowledges natural fluctuations and regards as unsustainable only practices which damage the genetic structure destroy habitat or deplete stock levels to the point where rebuilding requires more than a single generation providing rebuilding takes only one generation overfishing may be economically foolish but it is not unsustainable this definition is widely accepted1 maintaining a biological social and economic system considers the health of the human ecosystem as well as the marine ecosystem a fishery which rotates among multiple species can deplete individual stocks and still be sustainable so long as the ecosystem retains its intrinsic integrity such a definition might consider as sustainable fishing practices that lead to the reduction and possible extinction of some species1 social sustainabilityedit fisheries and aquaculture are directly or indirectly a source of livelihood for over 500 million people mostly in developing countries10 social sustainability can conflict with biodiversity a fishery is socially sustainable if the fishery ecosystem maintains the ability to deliver products the society can use major species shifts within the ecosystem could be acceptable as long as the flow of such products continues1 humans have been operating such regimes for thousands of years transforming many ecosystems depleting or driving to extinction many species11 to a great extent sustainability is like good art it is hard to describe but we know it when we see it ray hilborn 1 according to hilborn the loss of some species and indeed transformation of the ecosystem is not incompatible with sustainable harvests1 for example in recent years barndoor skates have been caught as bycatch in the western atlantic their numbers have severely declined and they will probably go extinct if these catch rates continue12 even if the barndoor skate goes extinct changing the ecosystem there could still be sustainable fishing of other commercial species1 reconciling fisheries with conservationedit management goals might consider the impact of salmon on bear and river ecosystems at the fourth world fisheries congress in 2004 daniel pauly asked how can fisheries science and conservation biology achieve a reconciliation then answered his own question by accepting each others essentials that fishing should remain a viable occupation and that aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity are allowed to persist13 a relatively new concept is relationship farming this is a way of operating farms so they restore the food chain in their area re-establishing a healthy food chain can result in the farm automatically filtering out impurities from feed water and air feeding its own food chain and additionally producing high net yields for harvesting an example is the large cattle ranch veta la palma in southern spain relationship farming was first made popular by joel salatin who created a 220 hectare relationship farm featured prominently in michael pollans book the omnivores dilemma 2006 and the documentary films food inc and fresh the basic concept of relationship farming is to put effort into building a healthy food chain and then the food chain does the hard work obstaclesedit large areas of the global continental shelf highlighted in cyan have had heavy bottom trawls repeatedly dragged over them overfishingedit main article overfishing overfishing can be sustainable according to hilborn overfishing can be a misallocation of societies resources but it does not necessarily threaten conservation or sustainability1 overfishing is traditionally defined as harvesting so many fish that the yield is less than it would be if fishing were reduced1 for example pacific salmon are usually managed by trying to determine how many spawning salmon called the escapement are needed each generation to produce the maximum harvestable surplus the optimum escapement is that needed to reach that surplus if the escapement is half the optimum then normal fishing looks like overfishing but this is still sustainable fishing which could continue indefinitely at its reduced stock numbers and yield there is a wide range of escapement sizes that present no threat that the stock might collapse or that the stock structure might erode1 on the other hand overfishing can precede severe stock depletion and fishery collapse14 hilborn points out that continuing to exert fishing pressure while production decreases stock collapses and the fishery fails is largely the product of institutional failure1 today over 70 of fish species are either fully exploited overexploited depleted or recovering from depletion if overfishing does not decrease it is predicted that stocks of all species currently commercially fished for will collapse by 2048.15 a hubbert linearization hubbert curve has been applied to the whaling industry as well as charting the price of caviar which depends on sturgeon stocks16 another example is north sea cod comparing fisheries and mineral extraction tells us that human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a hubbert depletion cycle1718 fishing down the food web coastal fishing communities in bangladesh are vulnerable to flooding from sea-level rises19 island with fringing reef in the maldives coral reefs are dying around the world20 shrinking of the aral sea habitat modificationedit see also environmental effects of fishing and destructive fishing practices nearly all the worlds continental shelves and large areas of continental slopes underwater ridges and seamounts have had heavy bottom trawls and dredges repeatedly dragged over their surfaces for fifty years governments and organizations such as the asian development bank have encouraged the fishing industry to develop trawler fleets repeated bottom trawling and dredging literally flattens diversity in the benthic habitat radically changing the associated communities21 changing the ecosystem balanceedit main article fishing down the food web since 1950 90 percent of 25 species of big predator fish have gone how we are emptying our seas the sunday times may 10 2009 pauly daniel 2004 reconciling fisheries with conservation the challenge of managing aquatic ecosystems fourth world fisheries congress vancouver 2004 climate changeedit main article fisheries and climate change rising ocean temperatures22 and ocean acidification23 are radically altering aquatic ecosystems climate change is modifying fish distribution24 and the productivity of marine and freshwater species this reduces sustainable catch levels across many habitats puts pressure on resources needed for aquaculture on the communities that depend on fisheries and on the oceans ability to capture and store carbon biological pump sea level rise puts coastal fishing communities at risk while changing rainfall patterns and water use impact on inland freshwater fisheries and aquaculture ocean pollutionedit main article marine pollution a recent survey of global ocean health concluded that all parts of the ocean have been impacted by human development and that 41 percent has been fouled with human polluted runoff overfishing and other abuses25 pollution is not easy to fix because pollution sources are so dispersed and are built into the economic systems we depend on the united nations environment programme unep mapped the impacts of stressors such as climate change pollution exotic species and over-exploitation of resources on the oceans the report shows at least 75 percent of the worlds key fishing grounds may be affected262728 diseases and toxinsedit see also fish diseases and parasites harmful algal blooms and mercury in fish large predator fish contain significant amounts of mercury a neurotoxin which can affect fetal development memory mental focus and produce tremors irrigationedit abandoned ship near aral kazakhstan lakes are dependent on the inflow of water from its drainage basin in some areas aggressive irrigation has caused this inflow to decrease significantly causing water depletion and a shrinking of the lake the most notable example is the aral sea formerly among the four largest lakes in the world now only a tenth of its former surface area remediationedit fisheries managementedit main article fisheries management fisheries management draws on fisheries science to enable sustainable exploitation modern fisheries management is often defined as mandatory rules based on concrete objectives and a mix of management techniques enforced by a monitoring control and surveillance system293031 ideas and rules economist paul romer believes sustainable growth is possible providing the right ideas technology are combined with the right rules rather than simply hectoring fishers there has been no lack of innovative ideas about how to harvest fish he characterizes failures as primarily failures to apply appropriate rules3233 fishing subsidies government subsidies influence many of the world fisheries operating cost subsidies allow european and asian fishing fleets to fish in distant waters such as west africa many experts reject fishing subsidies and advocate restructuring incentives globally to help struggling fisheries recover3435 economics another focus of conservationists is on curtailing detrimental human activities by improving fisheries market structure with techniques such as salable fishing quotas like those set up by the northwest atlantic fisheries organization or laws such as those listed below36 payment for ecosystem services environmental economist essam y mohammed argues that by creating direct economic incentives whereby people are able to receive payment for the services their property provides will help to establish sustainable fisheries around the world as well as inspire conservation where it otherwise would not37 sustainable fisheries certification a promising direction is the independent certification programs for sustainable fisheries conducted by organizations such as the marine stewardship council and friend of the sea these programs work at raising consumer awareness and insight into the nature of their seafood purchases ecosystem based fisheries see next section ecosystem based fisheriesedit we propose that rebuilding ecosystems and not sustainability per se should be the goal of fishery management sustainability is a deceptive goal because human harvesting of fish leads to a progressive simplification of ecosystems in favour of smaller high turnover lower trophic level fish species that are adapted to withstand disturbance and habitat degradation tony pitcher and daniel pauly 38 according to marine ecologist chris frid the fishing industry points to marine pollution and global warming as the causes of recent unprecedented declines in fish populations frid counters that overfishing has also altered the way the ecosystem works everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences human and natural on fish dynamics he adds fish communities can be altered in a number of ways for example they can decrease if particular-sized individuals of a species are targeted as this affects predator and prey dynamics fishing however is not the sole cause of changes to marine lifepollution is another exampleno one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor39 the traditional approach to fisheries science and management has been to focus on a single species this can be contrasted with the ecosystem-based approach ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions40 in a 2007 effort to stimulate much needed discussion and clarify the essential components of ecosystem-based fisheries science a group of scientists offered the following ten commandments for ecosystem-based fisheries scientists41 keep a perspective that is holistic risk-adverse and adaptive maintain an old growth structure in fish populations since big old and fat female fish have been shown to be the best spawners but are also susceptible to overfishing characterize and maintain the natural spatial structure of fish stocks so that management boundaries match natural boundaries in the sea monitor and maintain seafloor habitats to make sure fish have food and shelter maintain resilient ecosystems that are able to withstand occasional shocks identify and maintain critical food-web connections including predators and forage species adapt to ecosystem changes through time both short-term and on longer cycles of decades or centuries including global climate change account for evolutionary changes caused by fishing which tends to remove large older fish include the actions of humans and their social and economic systems in all ecological equations marine protected areasedit main article marine protected areas strategies and techniques for marine conservation tend to combine theoretical disciplines such as population biology with practical conservation strategies such as setting up protected areas as with marine protected areas mpas or voluntary marine conservation areas each nation defines mpas independently but they commonly involve increased protection for the area from fishing and other threats42 marine life is not evenly distributed in the oceans most of the really valuable ecosystems are in relatively shallow coastal waters above or near the continental shelf where the sunlit waters are often nutrient rich from land runoff or upwellings at the continental edge allowing photosynthesis which energizes the lowest trophic levels in the 1970s for reasons more to do with oil drilling than with fishing the us extended its jurisdiction then 12 miles from the coast to 200 miles this made huge shelf areas part of its territory other nations followed extending national control to what became known as the exclusive economic zone eez this move has had many implications for fisheries conservation since it means that most of the most productive maritime ecosystems are now under national jurisdictions opening possibilities for protecting these ecosystems by passing appropriate laws daniel pauly characterises marine protected areas as a conservation tool of revolutionary importance that is being incorporated into the fisheries mainstream2 the pew charitable trusts have funded various initiatives aimed at encouraging the development of mpas and other ocean conservation measures43444546 fish farmingedit see also salmon farming issues there exists concerns that farmed fish cannot produce necessary yields efficiently for example farmed salmon eat three pounds of wild fish to produce one pound of salmon4748495051525354 laws and treatiesedit international laws and treaties related to marine conservation include the 1966 convention on fishing and conservation of living resources of the high seas united states laws related to marine conservation include

stewardship council and friend of the sea other organizations offer advice to members of the public who eat with an eye to sustainability according to the marine conservation biologist callum roberts four criteria apply when choosing seafood57 is the species in trouble in the wild where the animals were caught does fishing for the species damage ocean habitats is there a large amount of bycatch

conservation society62 the southern african sustainable seafood initiative63 data issuesedit data qualityedit one of the major impediments to the rational control of marine resources is inadequate data according to fisheries scientist milo adkison 2007 the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is poor data fisheries management decisions are often based on population models but the models need quality data to be accurate scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data64 unreported fishingedit estimates of illegal catch losses range between 10 billion and 23 billion annually representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes65 incidental catch2 shifting baselinesedit shifting baselines is a term which describes the way significant changes to a system are measured against previous baselines which themselves may represent significant changes from the original state of the system the term was first used by the fisheries scientist daniel pauly in his paper anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries66 pauly developed the term in reference to fisheries management where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct baseline population size eg how abundant a fish species population was before human exploitation and thus work with a shifted baseline he describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline rather than the fishery in its untouched state areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago may have experienced long term decline but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations in this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were and are masked there is a loss of perception of change that occurs when each generation redefines what is natural67 looting the seasedit looting the seas is the name given by the international consortium of investigative journalists to a series of journalistic investigations into areas directly affecting
