coast24 in portuguese brazilwood is called pau-brasil with the word brasil commonly given the etymology red like an ember formed from latin brasa ember and the suffix -il from -iculum or -ilium25 as brazilwood produces a deep red dye it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil26 throughout the 16th century massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples mostly tupi along the brazilian coast who sold the timber to european traders mostly portuguese but also french in return for assorted european consumer goods27 the official portuguese name of the land in original portuguese records was the land of the holy cross terra da santa cruz28 but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the land of brazil terra do brasil on account of the brazilwood trade29 the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name early sailors sometimes also called it the land of parrots terra di papaga30 in the guarani language an official language of paraguay brazil is called pindorama this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region meaning land of the palm trees31 history main article history of brazil pre-cabraline era main article history of brazil precolonial history megaliths in the solstice archaeological park in amap erected between 500 and 2000 years ago probably to carry out astronomical observations the earliest human remains found in the americas luzia woman were found in the area of pedro leopoldo minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years3233 the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago 6000 bc the pottery was found near santarm and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture34 around the time of the portuguese arrival the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people35 mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting fishing gathering and migrant agriculture the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups eg the tupis guaranis gs and arawaks the tup people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinambs and there were also many subdivision of the other groups36 before the arrival of europeans the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture language and moral beliefs37 these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war3839 while heredity had some weight leadership status was more subdued over time than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions40 slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations41 portuguese colonization main article colonial brazil representation of the landing of pedro lvares cabral in porto seguro 1500 the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro lvares cabral42 the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes most of whom spoke languages of the tupiguarani family and fought among themselves43 though the first settlement was founded in 1532 colonization was effectively begun in 1534 when king dom jooiii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil4445 however the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america4546 in the first two centuries of colonization indigenous and european groups lived in constant war establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other47484950 by the mid-16th century cane sugar had become brazils most important exportation product4351 and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa in the slave market of western africa52 not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique had become its largest import5354 to cope with plantations of sugarcane due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar5556 painting showing the arrest of tiradentes he was sentenced to death for his involvement in the best known movement for independence in colonial brazil by the end of the 17th century sugarcane exports began to decline57 and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colonys economy fostering a brazilian gold rush58 which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world59 this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers60 portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders6162 in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil in incursions that the portuguese had to fight notably the french in rio during the 1560s in maranho during the 1610s and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco during the dutchportuguese war after the end of iberian union63 the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugals wealthiest and largest colony to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance such as the quilombo of palmares64 and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence such as the minas conspiracy65 united kingdom with

they established some of brazils first financial institutions such as its local stock exchanges67 and its national bank additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations in 1809 in retaliation for being forced into exile the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana68 with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joo return to portugal deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony in 1815 in order to justify continuing to live in brazil where the royal court had thrived for the past six years the crown established the united kingdom of portugal brazil and the algarves thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state69 however such a ploy didnt last long since the leadership in portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony continued to require the return of court to lisbon as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820 as well as groups of brazilians impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic as showed by the 1817 pernambucan revolt69 in 1821 as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto70 d joo vi was unable to hold out any longer and departed for lisbon there he swore oath to the new constitution leaving

of republican secession78 as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi pedroi went to portugal to reclaim his daughters crown abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir who thus became the empires second monarch with the regnal title of dom pedroii79 pedro ii emperor of brazil between 1831 and 1889 as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age a regency was set up by the national assembly80 in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power during this period a series of localized rebellions took place as the cabanagem the mal revolt the balaiada the sabinada and the ragamuffin war which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast slaveholding and newly independent nation state81 this period of internal political and social upheaval which included the praieira revolt was overcome only at the end of the 1840s years after the end of the regency which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841.82 during the last phase of the monarchy internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,83 as a result of the british aberdeen act but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country was the institution formally abolished84 the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay85

side105106 after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with axis powers in the wake of the pan-american conference107 with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe vargass position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup with

assumed the presidency becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime127 sarneys unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown fernando collor who was subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992.128 collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco who appointed fernando henrique cardoso as minister of finance in 1994 cardoso produced a highly successful plano real129 that after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation finally granted stability to the brazilian economy130131 leading cardoso to be elected that year and again in 1998.132 the peaceful transition of power from fernando henrique to his main opposition leader luiz incio lula da silva elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006 was seen as a proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability133134 however sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades against corruption police brutality inefficiencies of political establishment and public service
