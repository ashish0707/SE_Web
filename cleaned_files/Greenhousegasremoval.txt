greenhouse gas removal projects are a type of climate engineering that seek to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and thus they tackle the root cause of global warming these techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly the discipline overlaps with carbon capture and storage and carbon sequestration and some projects listed may not be considered to be geoengineering by all commentators instead being described as mitigation1 contents 1 carbon sequestration 2 chlorofluorocarbon photochemistry 3 methane removal 4 see also 5 references carbon sequestrationedit main articles bio-energy with carbon capture and storage carbon negative fuel carbon sequestration carbon dioxide removal and carbon dioxide air capture a wide range of techniques for carbon sequestration exist these range from ideas to remove co2 from the atmosphere carbon dioxide air capture flue gases carbon capture and storage and by preventing carbon in biomass from re-entering the atmosphere such as with bio-energy with carbon capture and storage beccs chlorofluorocarbon photochemistryedit atmospheric chlorofluorocarbon cfc removal is an idea which suggests using lasers to break up cfcs an important family of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere2 methane removaledit methane potentially poses major challenges for remediation it is around 20 times as powerful a greenhouse gas as co23 large quantities may be outgassed from permafrost and clathrates4 as a result of global warming notably in the arctic5 there are existing climate engineering proposals67 methane is removed by several natural processes which can be enhanced chemical decomposition reaction with hydroxyl radicals produced from photochemical decomposition of ozone in the stratosphere biological decomposition by methanotrophs in soils and water8 see alsoedit carbon negative fuel solar radiation management climate change mitigation avoiding dangerous climate change referencesedit wigley tm october 2006 a combined mitigationgeoengineering approach to climate stabilization science 314 5798 4524 bibcode2006sci314452w doi101126science1131728 pmid16973840 stix th 79 jun 1993 removal of chlorofluorocarbons from the troposphere 1993 ieee international conference on plasma science vancouver bc canada ieee p135 doi101109plasma1993593398 isbn0-7803-1360-7 methane as a greenhouse gas ccsp research highlight 1 us climate change science program january 2006 buffett b archer d time-dependent response of the marine clathrate reservoir to climatic and anthropogenic forcing american geophysical union spring meeting 2005 bibcode2005agusmu33a05b 2005agusm.u33a..05b methane release from arctic clathrates could threaten global climate international polar foundation 4 june 2008 stolaroff j k bhattacharyya s smith c a bourcier w l cameron-smith p j aines r d 2012 review of methane mitigation technologies with application to rapid release of methane from the arctic environmental science technology 46 12 6455 doi101021es204686w lockley a 2012 comment on review of methane mitigation technologies with application to rapid release of methane from the arctic environmental science technology 46 24 1355213553 doi101021es303074j reeburgh william s david t heggie 1977 microbial methane consumption reactions and their effect on methane distributions in freshwater and marine environments pdf limnology and oceanography 22 1 19 doi104319lo19772210001
