saccharum officinarum sugar cane growing queensland 2016 cut sugarcane sugarcane and bowl of refined sugar sugarcane or sugar cane is one of the several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus saccharum tribe andropogoneae native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of south asia and melanesia and used for sugar production it has stout jointed fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose which accumulates in the stalk internodes the plant is 2 to 6m 6ft 7in to 19ft 8in tall all sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids sugarcane belongs to the grass family poaceae an economically important seed plant family that includes maize wheat rice and sorghum and many forage crops sucrose extracted and purified in specialized mill factories is used as raw material in human food industries or is fermented to produce ethanol ethanol is produced on a large scale by the brazilian sugarcane industry sugarcane is the worlds largest crop by production quantity1 in 2012 the food and agriculture organization estimates it was cultivated on about 26106 hectares 6.4107 acres in more than 90 countries with a worldwide harvest of 1.83109 tonnes 1.80109 long tons 2.02109 short tons brazil was the largest producer of sugar cane in the world the next five major producers in decreasing amounts of production were india china thailand pakistan and mexico the world demand for sugar is the primary driver of sugarcane agriculture cane accounts for 80 of sugar produced most of the rest is made from sugar beets sugarcane predominantly grows in the tropical and subtropical regions sugar beets grow in colder temperate regions other than sugar products derived from sugarcane include falernum molasses rum cachaa a traditional spirit from brazil bagasse and ethanol in some regions people use sugarcane reeds to make pens mats screens and thatch the young unexpanded inflorescence of tebu telor is eaten raw steamed or toasted and prepared in various ways in certain island communities of indonesia2 the persians followed by the greeks discovered the famous reeds that produce honey without bees in india between the 6th and 4th centuries bc they adopted and then spread sugarcane agriculture3 merchants began to trade in sugar from india which was considered a luxury and an expensive spice in the 18th century ad

external links descriptionedit sugarcane is a tropical perennial grass that forms lateral shoots at the base to produce multiple stems typically three to fourm 10 to 13ft high and about 5cm 2in in diameter the stems grow into cane stalk which when mature constitutes around 75 of the entire plant a mature stalk is typically composed of 1116 fiber 1216 soluble sugars 23 nonsugars and 6373 water a sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate soil type irrigation fertilizers insects disease control varieties and the harvest period the average yield of cane stalk is 6070 tonnes per hectare 2428long tonacre 2731short tonacre per year however this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation sugarcane is a cash crop but it is also used as livestock fodder6 historyedit see also history of sugar the westward diffusion of sugarcane in pre-islamic times shown in red in the medieval muslim world green and by europeans in the 15th century islands circled by violet lines7 sugarcane is indigenous to tropical south and southeast asia8 different species likely originated in different locations with saccharum barberi originating in india and s edule and s officinarum in new guinea8 it is theorized that sugarcane was first domesticated as a crop in new guinea around 6000 bc9 new guinean farmers and other early cultivators of sugarcane chewed the plant for its sweet juice early farmers in southeast asia and elsewhere may have also boiled the cane juice down to a viscous mass to facilitate transportation but the earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern india the exact date of the first cane sugar production is unclear the earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient sanskrit and pali texts10 around the 8th century arab traders introduced sugar from south asia to the other parts of the abbasid caliphate in the mediterranean mesopotamia egypt north africa and andalusia by the 10th century sources state that no village in mesopotamia did not grow sugarcane7 it was among the early crops brought to the americas by the spanish mainly andalusians from their fields in the canary islands and the portuguese from their fields in the madeira islands christopher columbus first brought sugarcane to the caribbean during his second voyage to the americas initially to the island of hispaniola modern day haiti and the dominican republic in colonial times sugar formed one side of the triangle trade of new world raw materials along with european manufactured goods and african slaves sugar often in the form of molasses was shipped from the caribbean to europe or new england where it was used to make rum the profits from the sale of sugar were then used to purchase manufactured goods which were then shipped to west africa where they were bartered for slaves the slaves were then brought back to the caribbean to be sold to sugar planters the profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar which was shipped to europe sugar plantation in the british colony of antigua 1823 france found its sugarcane islands so valuable that it effectively traded its portion of canada famously dubbed a few acres of snow to britain for their return of guadeloupe martinique and st lucia at the end of the seven years war the dutch similarly kept suriname a sugar colony in south america instead of seeking the return of the new netherlands new york boiling houses in the 17th through 19th centuries converted sugarcane juice into raw sugar these houses were attached to sugar plantations in the western colonies slaves often ran the boiling process under very poor conditions rectangular boxes of brick or stone served as furnaces with an opening at the bottom to stoke the fire and remove ashes at the top of each furnace were up to seven copper kettles or boilers each one smaller and hotter than the previous one the cane juice began in the largest kettle the juice was then heated and lime added to remove impurities the juice was skimmed and then channeled to successively smaller kettles the last kettle the teache was where the cane juice became syrup the next step was a cooling trough where the sugar crystals hardened around a sticky core of molasses this raw sugar was then shoveled from the cooling trough into hogsheads wooden barrels and from there into the curing house a sugar plantation on the island of runion in the late 19th century in the british empire slaves were liberated after 1833 and many would no longer work on sugarcane plantations when they had a choice british owners of sugarcane plantations therefore needed new workers and they found cheap labour in china portugal and india1112 the people were subject to indenture a long-established form of contract which bound them to forced labour for a fixed term apart from the fixed term of servitude this resembled slavery13 the first ships carrying indentured labourers from india left in 1836.14 the migrations to serve sugarcane plantations led to a significant number of ethnic indians southeast asians and chinese settling in various parts of the world15 in some islands and countries the south asian migrants now constitute between 10 to 50 percent of the population sugarcane plantations and asian ethnic groups continue to thrive in countries such as fiji natal burma sri lanka malaysia british guiana jamaica trinidad martinique french guiana guadeloupe grenada st lucia st vincent st kitts st croix suriname nevis and mauritius1416 old-fashioned indian sugarcane press c 1905 the then british colony of queensland now a state of australia imported between 55,000 and 62,500 estimates vary people from the south pacific islands to work on sugarcane plantations between 1863 and 1900.17 cuban sugar derived from sugarcane was exported to the ussr where it received price supports and was ensured a guaranteed market the 1991 dissolution of the soviet state forced the closure of most of cubas sugar industry sugarcane remains an important part of the economy of guyana belize barbados and haiti along with the dominican republic guadeloupe jamaica and other islands about 70 of the sugar produced globally comes from s officinarum and hybrids using this species918 a 19th-century lithograph by theodore bray showing a

sugarcane plantation in mauritius sugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or temperate climate with a minimum of 60cm 24in of annual moisture it is one of the most efficient photosynthesizers in the plant kingdom it is a c4 plant able to convert up to 1 of incident solar energy into biomass19 in prime growing regions such as mauritius dominican republic puerto rico india guyana indonesia pakistan peru brazil bolivia colombia australia ecuador cuba the philippines el salvador jamaica and hawaii sugarcane crops can produce over 15 kgm2 of cane once a major crop of the southeastern region of the united states sugarcane cultivation has declined there in recent decades and is now primarily confined to florida and louisiana sugarcane is cultivated in the tropics and subtropics in areas with a plentiful supply of water for a continuous period of more than 6-7 months each year either from natural rainfall or through irrigation the crop does not tolerate severe frosts therefore most of the worlds sugarcane is grown between 22n and 22s and some up to 33n and 33s.20 when sugarcane crop is found outside this range such as the natal region of south africa it is normally due to anomalous climatic conditions in the region such as warm ocean currents that sweep down the coast in terms of altitude sugarcane crop is found up to 1,600m close to the equator in countries such as colombia ecuador and peru21 sugarcane can be grown on many soils ranging from highly fertile well-drained mollisols through heavy cracking vertisols infertile acid oxisols peaty histosols to rocky andisols both plentiful sunshine and water supplies increase cane production this has made desert countries with good irrigation facilities such as egypt some of the highest-yielding sugarcane-cultivating regions sugarcane flower in dominica although sugarcanes produce seeds modern stem cutting has become the most common reproduction method each cutting must contain at least one bud and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted in more technologically advanced countries like the united states and australia billet planting is common billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground once planted a stand can be harvested several times after each harvest the cane sends up new stalks called ratoons successive harvests give decreasing yields eventually justifying replanting two to 10 harvests are usually made depending on the type of culture in a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields like in north america sugar canes are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields in countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting like in the french island la runion sugar canes are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting sugar canes harvested by women in ha bnh province vietnam sugarcane mechanical harvest in jaboticabal so paulo brazil sugarcane is harvested by hand and mechanically hand harvesting accounts for more than half of production and is dominant in the developing world in hand harvesting the field is first set on fire the fire burns dry leaves and chases away or kills any lurking venomous snakes without harming the stalks and roots harvesters then cut the cane just above ground-level using cane knives or machetes a skilled harvester can cut 500kg 1,100lb of sugarcane per hourcitation needed mechanical harvesting uses a combine or sugarcane harvester22 the austoft 7000 series the original modern harvester design has now been copied by other companies including camecojohn deere the machine cuts the cane at the base of the stalk strips the leaves chops the cane into consistent lengths and deposits it into a transporter following alongside the harvester then blows the trash back onto the field such machines can harvest 100 long tons 100t each hour however harvested cane must be rapidly processed once cut sugarcane begins to lose its sugar content and damage to the cane during mechanical harvesting accelerates this decline this decline is offset because a modern chopper harvester can complete the harvest faster and more efficiently than hand cutting and loading austoft also developed a series of hydraulic high-lift infield transporters to work alongside their harvesters to allow even more rapid transfer of cane to for example the nearest railway siding this mechanical harvesting doesnt require the field to be set on fire the remains left in the field by the machine consist of the top of the sugar cane and the dead leaves which act as mulch for the next round of planting a panoramic view of sugarcane plantations in brazil the largest producer in the world pestsedit the cane beetle also known as cane grub can substantially reduce crop yield by eating roots it can be controlled with imidacloprid confidor or chlorpyrifos lorsban other important pests are the larvae of some butterflymoth species including the turnip moth the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis the mexican rice borer eoreuma loftini leaf-cutting ants termites spittlebugs especially mahanarva fimbriolata and deois flavopicta and the beetle migdolus fryanus the planthopper insect eumetopina flavipes acts as a virus vector which causes the sugarcane disease ramu stunt23 pathogensedit main article list of sugarcane diseases numerous pathogens infect sugarcane such as sugarcane grassy shoot disease caused by phytoplasma whiptail disease or sugarcane smut pokkah boeng caused by fusarium moniliforme xanthomonas axonopodis bacteria causes gumming disease and red rot disease caused by colletotrichum falcatum viral diseases affecting sugarcane include sugarcane mosaic virus maize streak virus and sugarcane yellow leaf virus nitrogen fixationedit some sugarcane varieties are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in association with the bacterium glucoacetobacter diazotrophicus24 unlike legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants that form root nodules in the soil in association with bacteria g diazotrophicus lives within the intercellular spaces of the sugarcanes stem2526 coating seeds with the bacteria is a newly developed technology that can enable every crop species to fix nitrogen for its own use27 conditions for sugarcane workersedit at least 20,000 people are estimated to have died of chronic kidney disease ckd in central america in the past two decades most of them sugar cane workers along the pacific coast this may be due to working long hours in the heat without adequate fluid intake28 processingedit traditionally sugarcane processing requires two stages mills extract raw sugar from freshly harvested cane and mill-white sugar is sometimes produced immediately after the first stage at sugar-extraction mills intended for local consumption sugar crystals appear naturally in white color during the crystallization process sulfur dioxide is added to inhibit the formation of color-inducing molecules as well as to stabilize the sugar juices during evaporation2930 refineries often located nearer to consumers in north america europe and japan then produce refined white sugar which is 99 percent sucrose these two stages are slowly merging increasing affluence in the sugar-producing tropics increased demand for refined sugar products driving a trend toward combined milling and refining millingedit main article sugar cane mill brown top and white sugar crystals manually extracting juice from sugarcane a truck hauls cane to a sugar mill in florida sugarcane processing produces cane sugar sucrose from sugarcane other products of the processing include bagasse molasses and filtercake bagasse the residual dry fiber of the cane after cane juice has been extracted is used for several purposes31 fuel for the boilers and kilns production of paper paperboard products and reconstituted panelboard agricultural mulch and as a raw material for production of chemicals santa elisa sugarcane processing plant in sertozinho one of the largest and oldest in brazil the primary use of bagasse and bagasse residue is as a fuel source for the boilers in the generation of process steam in sugar plants dried filtercake is used as an animal feed supplement fertilizer and source of sugarcane wax molasses is produced in two forms blackstrap which has a characteristic strong flavor and a purer molasses syrup blackstrap molasses is sold as a food and dietary supplement it is also a common ingredient in animal feed is used to produce ethanol and rum and in the manufacturing of citric acid purer molasses syrups are sold as molasses and may also be blended with maple syrup invert sugars or corn syrup both forms of molasses are used in baking evaporator with baffled pan and foam dipper for making ribbon cane syrup refiningedit play media a video of sugarcane juice extraction sugar refining further purifies the raw sugar it is first mixed with heavy syrup and then centrifuged in a process called affination its purpose is to wash away the sugar crystals outer coating which is less pure than the crystal interior the remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup about 60 percent solids by weight the sugar solution is clarified by the addition of phosphoric acid and calcium hydroxide which combine to precipitate calcium phosphate the calcium phosphate particles entrap some impurities and absorb others and then float to the top of the tank where they can be skimmed off an alternative to this phosphatation technique is carbonatation which is similar but uses carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide to produce a calcium carbonate precipitate after filtering any remaining solids the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally used in this role32 some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon the purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum to produce white refined sugar as in a sugar mill the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging33 additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar when no more sugar can be economically recovered the final molasses still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose to produce granulated sugar in which individual grains do not clump sugar must be dried first by heating in a rotary dryer and then by blowing cool air through it for several days ribbon cane syrupedit ribbon cane is a subtropical type that was once widely grown in the southern united states as far north as coastal north carolina the juice was extracted with horse or mule-powered crushers the juice was boiled like maple syrup in a flat pan and then used in the syrup form as a food sweetener34 it is not currently a commercial crop but a few growers find ready sales for their productcitation needed pollution from sugarcane processingedit particulate matter combustion products and volatile organic compounds are the primary pollutants emitted during the sugarcane processing31 combustion products include nitrogen oxides nox carbon monoxide co co2 and sulfur oxides sox potential emission sources include the sugar granulators sugar conveying and packaging equipment bulk loadout operations boilers granular carbon and char regeneration kilns regenerated adsorbent transport systems kilns and handling equipment at some facilities carbonation tanks multi-effect evaporator stations and vacuum boiling pans modern pollution prevention technologies are capable of addressing all of these

worldwide yield of sugarcane crops in 2013 was 70.77 tons per hectare1 the most productive farms in the world were in peru with a nationwide average sugarcane crop yield of 133.71 tons per hectare the theoretical possible yield for sugar cane according to 1983 study of duke is about 280 metric tons per hectare per year and small experimental plots in brazil have demonstrated yields of 236280 metric tons of fresh cane per hectare3536 the most promising region for high yield sugarcane production were in sun drenched irrigated farms of northern africa and other deserts with plentiful water from river or irrigation canals in the united states sugarcane is grown commercially in florida hawaii louisiana and texas37 brazil uses sugarcane to produce sugar and ethanol for gasoline-ethanol blends gasohol a locally popular transportation fuel in india sugarcane is used to produce sugar jaggery and alcoholic beverages cane ethanoledit main article ethanol fuel a fuel pump in brazil offering cane ethanol a and gasoline g ethanol is generally available as a byproduct of sugar production it can be used as a biofuel alternative to gasoline and is widely used in cars in brazil it is an alternative to gasoline and may become the primary product of sugarcane processing rather than sugar in brazil gasoline is required to contain at least 22 percent bioethanol38 this bioethanol is sourced from brazils large sugarcane crop the production of ethanol from sugar cane is more energy efficient than from corn or sugar beets or palmvegetable oils particularly if cane bagasse is used to produce heat and power for the process furthermore if biofuels are used for crop production and transport the fossil energy input needed for each ethanol energy unit can be very low eia estimates that with an integrated sugar cane to ethanol technology the well-to-wheels co2 emissions can be 90 percent lower than conventional gasoline38 a textbook on renewable energy39 describes the energy transformation presently 75 tons of raw sugar cane are produced annually per hectare in brazil the cane delivered to the processing plant is called burned and cropped bc and represents 77 of the mass of the raw cane the reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves which are burned and whose ashes are left in the field as fertilizer and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop average cane production is therefore 58 tons of bc per hectare per year each ton of bc yields 740 kg of juice 135 kg of sucrose and 605 kg of water and 260 kg of moist bagasse 130 kg of dry bagasse since the lower heating value of sucrose is 16.5 mjkg and that of the bagasse is 19.2 mjkg the total heating value of a ton of bc is 4.7 gj of which 2.2 gj come from the sucrose and 2.5 from the bagasse per hectare per year the biomass produced corresponds to 0.27 tj this is equivalent to 0.86 w per square meter assuming an average insolation of 225 w per square meter the photosynthetic efficiency of sugar cane is 0.38 the 135 kg of sucrose found in 1 ton of bc are transformed into 70 litres of ethanol with a combustion energy of 1.7 gj the practical sucrose-ethanol conversion efficiency is therefore 76 compare with the theoretical 97 one hectare of sugar cane yields 4,000 litres of ethanol per year without any additional energy input because the bagasse produced exceeds the amount needed to distill the final product this however does not include the energy used in tilling transportation and so on thus the solar energy-to-ethanol conversion efficiency is 0.13 bagasse applicationsedit sugarcane is a major crop in many countries it is one of the plants with the highest bioconversion efficiency sugarcane crop is able to efficiently fix solar energy yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually after harvest the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse the fibrous dry matter this dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production40 sugarcane bagasse is a potentially abundant source of energy for large producers of sugarcane such as brazil india and china according to one report with use of latest technologies bagasse produced annually in brazil has the potential of meeting 20 percent of brazils energy consumption by 2020.41 electricity productionedit a number of countries in particular those devoid of any fossil fuel have implemented energy conservation and efficiency measures to minimize energy used in cane processing and furthermore export any excess electricity to the grid bagasse is usually burned to produce steam which in turn creates electricity current technologies such as those in use in mauritius produce over 100 kwh of electricity per tonne of bagasse with a total world harvest of over 1 billion tonnes of sugar cane per year the global energy potential from bagasse is over 100,000 gwh42 using mauritius as a reference an annual potential of 10,000 gwh of additional electricity could be produced throughout africa43 electrical generation from bagasse could become quite important particularly to the rural populations of sugarcane producing nations recent cogeneration technology plants are being designed to produce from 200 to over 300 kwh of electricity per tonne of bagasse4445 as sugarcane is a seasonal crop shortly after harvest the supply of bagasse would peak requiring power generation plants to strategically manage the storage of bagasse biogas productionedit a greener alternative to burning bagasse for the production of electricity is to convert bagasse into biogas technologies are being developed to use enzymes to transform bagasse into advanced biofuel and biogas41 sugarcane as
