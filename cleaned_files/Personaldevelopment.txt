cultivate their persons they first rectified their hearts wishing to rectify their hearts they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts wishing to be sincere in their thoughts they first extended to the utmost their knowledge such extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things13 contextsedit psychologyedit psychology became linked to personal development startingwhen with alfred adler 18701937 and carl jung 18751961 adler refused to limit psychology to analysis making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences14 he also originated the concepts of lifestyle 1929he defined lifestyle as an individuals characteristic approach to life in facing problems and of self imagecitation needed a concept that influenced management under the heading of work-life balanceclarification needed carl gustav jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of individuation which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the self15 daniel levinson 19201994 developed jungs early concept of life stages and included a sociological perspective levinson proposed that personal development come under the influencethroughout lifeof aspirations which he called the dream whatever the nature of his dream a young man has the developmental task of giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out it makes a great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is consonant with and infused by the dream or opposed to it if the dream remains unconnected to his life it may simply die and with it his sense of aliveness and purpose16 levinsons model of seven life-stages has been considerably modifiedby whom due to sociological changeswhich in the lifecycle17 research on success in reaching goals as undertaken by albert bandura born 1925 suggested that self-efficacy18 best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results according to bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because19 it makes you expect to succeed it allows you take risks and set challenging goals it helps you keep trying if at first you dont succeed it helps you control emotions and fears when the going gets rough in 1998 martin seligman won election to a one-year term as president of the american psychological association and proposed a new focus on healthy individualscitation needed rather than on pathology he created the positive psychology current we have

in the westcitation needed in the form of the greek philosopherswhich and in the eastcitation needed with confucius some peoplewhich emphasize personal development as a part of higher education wilhelm von humboldt who founded the university of berlin since 1949 humboldt university of berlin in 1810 made a statement interpretableby whom as referring to personal development if there is one thing more than another which absolutely requires free activity on the part of the individual it is precisely education whose object it is to develop the individual21 during the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on american campuses22 led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students arthur chickering defined seven vectors of personal development23 for young

own learning in the 1990s business schools began to set up specific personal-development programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the european foundation for management development

exchange programscitation needed the first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between metizo26 a personal-development

academic disciplines education for questions of learning and assessment psychology for motivation and personality sociology for identity and social networks economics for human capital and economic value philosophy for ethics and self-reflection the workplaceedit abraham maslow 19081970 proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top defined as29 the desire to become more and more what one is to become everything that one is capable of becoming since maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people self-actualizehe estimated one percent30his hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employeescitation needed as organizations and labor markets became more global responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individualclarification needed in 1999 management thinker peter drucker wrote in the harvard business review we live in an age of unprecedented opportunity if youve got ambition and smarts you can rise to the top of your chosen profession regardless of where you started out but with opportunity comes responsibility companies today arent managing their employees careers knowledge workers must effectively be their own chief executive officers its up to you to carve out your place to know when to change course and to keep yourself engaged and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years31 management professors sumantra ghoshal of the london business school and christopher bartlett of the harvard business school wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract32 on the one hand the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative creativity and skills of all employees on the other hand employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and  embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development the 1997 publication of ghoshals and bartletts individualized corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilitiescitation needed another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that womens careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men the 2007 study of womens careers by sylvia ann hewlett off-ramps and on-ramps33 had a major impact on the way companies view careerscitation needed further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by herminia ibarra in her working identity on the relationship with career change and identity change34 indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life personal development programs in companies fall into two categories the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies employee benefits have the purpose of improving satisfaction motivation and loyaltycitation needed employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs preferences and problems and they use the results to design benefits programscitation needed typical programs in this category include work-life balance time management stress management health programs counseling many such programs resemble programs that some employees might conceivably pay for themselves outside work yoga sports martial arts money-management positive psychology nlp etccitation needed as an investment personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving productivity innovation or quality proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organizations strategic development goals employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires perceived high-potential employees perceived key employees sales staff research staff and perceived future leaderscitation needed organizations may also offer other non-investment-oriented programs to many or even all employees typical programswhich focus on career-development personal effectiveness teamwork and competency-development personal development also forms an element in management tools

actualization movementnot only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or notcitation needed others similarly point out that with self-help books supply increases the demandthe more people read them the more they think
