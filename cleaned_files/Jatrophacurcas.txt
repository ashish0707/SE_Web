jatropha curcas scientific classification kingdom plantae unranked angiosperms unranked eudicots unranked rosids order malpighiales family euphorbiaceae1 genus jatropha species jcurcas binomial name jatropha curcas l2 jatropha curcas is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family euphorbiaceae that is native to the american tropics most likely mexico and central america3 it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world becoming naturalized in some areas the specific epithet curcas was first used by portuguese doctor garcia de orta more than 400 years ago and is of uncertain origin4 common names include barbados nut purging nut physic nut or jcl abbreviation of jatropha curcas linnaeus j curcas is a poisonous semi-evergreen shrub or small tree reaching a height of 6m 20ft.3 it is resistant to a high degree of aridity allowing it to be grown in deserts56 the seeds contain 27-40 oil7 average 34.48 that can be processed to produce a high-quality biodiesel fuel usable in a standard diesel engine the seeds are also a source of the highly poisonous toxalbumin curcin or jatrophin9 contents 1 botanical features 2 cultivation 3 propagation 4 gallery 5 processing

external links botanical featuresedit leaves the leaves have significant variability in their morphology in general the leaves are green to pale green alternate to subopposite and three- to five-lobed with a spiral phyllotaxis1 flowers male and female flowers are produced on the same inflorescence averaging 20 male flowers to each female flower10 or 10 male flowers to each female flower11 the petiole length ranges from 6.123.1 mm the inflorescence can be formed in the leaf axil plants are monoecious and also presents hermaphroditic flowers occasionally1 fruits fruits are produced in winter or there may be several crops during the year if soil moisture is good and temperatures are sufficiently high most fruit production is concentrated from midsummer to late fall with variations in production peaks where some plants have two or three harvests and some produce continuously through the season1 seeds the seeds are mature when the capsule changes from green to yellow the seeds contain around 20 saturated fatty acids and 80 unsaturated fatty acids and they yield 2540 oil by weight in addition the seeds contain other chemical compounds such as saccharose raffinose stachyose glucose fructose galactose and protein the oil is largely made up of oleic and linoleic acids furthermore the plant also contains curcasin arachidic myristic palmitic and stearic acids and curcin1 genome the whole genome was sequenced by kazusa dna research institute chiba japan in october 2010.12 cultivationedit jatropha curcas seeds cultivation is uncomplicated jatropha curcas grows in tropical and subtropical regions13 the plant can grow in wastelands and grows on almost any terrain even on gravelly sandy and saline soils it can thrive in poor and stony soils although new research suggests that the plants ability to adapt to these poor soils is not as extensive as had been previously stated complete germination is achieved within 9 days adding manure during the germination has negative effects during that phase but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved it can be propagated by cuttings which yields faster results than multiplication by seeds the flowers only develop terminally at the end of a stem so a good ramification plants presenting many branches produces the greatest amount of fruits the plants are self-compatible10 another productivity factor is the ratio between female and male flowers within an inflorescence more female flowers mean more fruits11 jatropha curcas thrives on a mere 250mm 10in of rain a year and only during its first two years does it need to be watered in the closing days of the dry season ploughing and planting are not needed regularly as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years the use of pesticides is not necessary due to the pesticidal and fungicidal properties of the plant it is used in rural bengal for dhobi itch a common fungal infection of the skin while jatropha curcas starts yielding from 9-12 months time the best yields are obtained only after 23 years time the seed production is around 3.5 tons per hectare seed production ranges from about 0.4 tha in the first year to over 5 tha after 3 years if planted in hedges the reported productivity of jatropha is from 0.8 to 1.0kg of seed per meter of live fencecitation needed propagationedit jatropha curcas has limited natural vegetative propagation and is usually propagated by seed propagation through seed sexual propagation leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth biomass seed yield and oil content low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit seed propagation however clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species vegetative propagation has been achieved by stem cuttings grafting budding as well as by air layering techniques14 the investigation leads to the recommendation that cuttings should be taken preferably from juvenile plants and treated with 200 micro gram per litre of iba rooting hormone to ensure the highest level of rooting in stem cuttings these vegetative methods have potential for commercial propagation of these plants galleryedit propagation of jatropha curcas by stem cutting propagation of jatropha curcas by grafting propagation of jatropha curcas by air layering jatropha crude oil processingedit seed extraction is made simple with the use of the universal nut sheller an appropriate technology designed by the full belly project oil content varies from 28 to 30 and 80 extraction one hectare of plantation will give 400 to 600 litres of oil if the soil is average15 the oily seeds are processed into oil which may be used directly straight vegetable oil to fuel combustion engines or may be subjected to transesterification to produce biodiesel jatropha oil is not suitable for human consumption as it induces strong vomiting and diarrhea a colourant can also be derived from the seedcitation needed usesedit biofueledit jatropha plantation in the dry centerwest of the paraguay chaco when jatropha seeds are crushed the resulting jatropha oil can be processed to produce a high-quality biofuel or biodiesel that can be used in a standard diesel car or further processed into jet fuel while the residue press cake can also be used as biomass feedstock to power electricity plants used as fertilizer it contains nitrogen phosphorus and potassium or as animal fodder the cake can also be used as feed in digesters and gasifiers to produce biogas16 from planting to harvest treat the jatropha plant as well as possible to make the harvest as large as possible a reference to the compulsory planting of jatropha in indonesia for the production of oil as machinery lubricant and fuel for the japanese wwii war effort there are several forms of biofuel often manufactured using sedimentation centrifugation and filtration the fats and oils are turned into esters while separating the glycerin at the end of the process the glycerin settles and the biofuel floats the process through which the glycerin is separated from the biodiesel is known as transesterification glycerin is another by-product from jatropha oil processing that can add value to the crop transesterification is a simple chemical reaction that neutralizes the free fatty acids present in any fatty substances in jatropha a chemical exchange takes place between the alkoxy groups of an ester compound by an alcohol usually methanol and ethanol are used for the purpose the reaction occurs by the presence of a catalyst usually sodium hydroxide naoh or caustic soda and potassium hydroxide koh which forms fatty esters eg methyl or ethyl esters commonly known as biodiesel it takes approximately 10 of methyl alcohol by weight of the fatty substance to start the transesterification process1 estimates of jatropha seed yield vary widely due to a lack of research data the genetic diversity of the crop the range of environments in which it is grown and jatrophas perennial life cycle seed yields under cultivation can range from 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms per hectare corresponding to extractable oil yields of 540 to 680 litres per hectare 58 to 73 us gallons per acre17 in 2009 time magazine cited the potential for as much as 1,600 gallons of diesel fuel per acre per year18 the plant may yield more than four times as much fuel per hectare as soybean and more than ten times that of maize corn but at the same time it requires five times as much water per unit of energy produced as does corn see below a hectare of jatropha has been claimed to produce 1,892 litres of fuel19 however as it has not yet been domesticated or improved by plant breeders yields are variable20 jatropha can also be intercropped with other cash crops such as coffee sugar fruits and vegetables21 in 2007 goldman sachs cited jatropha curcas as one of the best candidates for future biodiesel production22 however despite its abundance and use as an oil and reclamation plant none of the jatropha species has been properly domesticated and as a result its productivity is variable and the long-term impact of its large-scale use on soil quality and the environment is unknown23 in 2008 researchers at daimler chrysler research explored the use of jatropha oil for automotive use concluding that although jatropha oil as fuel has not yet reached optimal quality  it already fulfills the eu norm for biodiesel quality archer daniels midland company bayer cropscience and daimler ag have a joint project to develop jatropha as a biofuel24 three mercedes cars powered by jatropha diesel have already put some 30,000 kilometres behind them the project is supported by daimlerchrysler and by the german association for investment and development deutschen investitions- und entwicklungsgesellschaft deg jet fueledit aviation fuels may be more widely replaced by biofuels such as jatropha oil than fuels for other forms of transportation there are fewer planes than cars or trucks and far fewer jet fueling stations to convert than gas stations25 on december 30 2008 air new zealand flew the first successful test flight from auckland with a boeing 747 running one of its four rolls-royce engines on a 5050 blend of jatropha oil and jet a-1 fuel2526 in the same press release air new zealand announced plans to use the new fuel for 10 of its needs by 2013 at the time of this test jatropha oil was much cheaper than crude oil costing an estimated 43 a barrel or about one-third of the june 4 2008 closing price of 122.30 for a barrel of crude oil27 on january 7 2009 continental airlines successfully completed a test flight from houston texas using a 5050 mixture of algaejatropha-oil-derived biofuel and jet a in one of the two cfm56 engines of a boeing 737-800 next generation jet the two-hour test flight could mark another promising step for the airline industry to find cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuel on april 1 2011 interjet completed the first mexican aviation biofuels test flight on an airbus a320 the fuel was a 7030 traditional jet fuel biojet blend produced from jatropha oil provided by three mexican producers global energas renovables a wholly owned subsidiary of us-based global clean energy holdings bencafser sa and energy jh sa honeywells uop processed the oil into bio-spk synthetic paraffinic kerosene28 global energas renovables operates the largest jatropha farm in the americas28 on october 28 2011 air china completed the first successful demonstration flight by a chinese airline that used jatropha-based biofuel the mixture was a 5050 mix of conventional jet fuel blended with jatropha oil from china national petroleum corp the 747-400 powered one of its four engines on the fuel mixture during the 1-hour flight around beijing airport29 carbon dioxide sequestrationedit according to a 2013 study published by the european geosciences union30 the jatropha tree may have applications in the absorption of carbon dioxide whose sequestration is important in combating climate change31 this small tree is very resistant to aridity so it can be planted in hot and dry land in soil unsuitable for food production the plant does need water to grow though so coastal areas where desalinated seawater can be made available are idealcitation needed use in developing worldedit currently the oil from jatropha curcas seeds is used for making biodiesel fuel in philippines pakistan and in brazil where it grows naturally and in plantations in the southeast north and northeast of brazil likewise jatropha oil is being promoted as an easily grown biofuel crop in hundreds of projects throughout india and other developing countries32 large plantings and nurseries have been undertaken in india by many research institutions and by womens self-help groups who use a system of microcredit to ease poverty among semiliterate indian women the railway line between mumbai and delhi is planted with jatropha and the train itself runs on 15-20 biodiesel20 in africa cultivation of jatropha is being promoted and it is grown successfully in countries such as mali33 in the gran chaco of paraguay where a native variety jatropha matacensis also grows studies have shown the suitability of jatropha cultivation3435 and agro producers are starting to consider planting in the region36 burmaedit burma is also actively pursuing the use of jatropha oil on 15 december 2005 then-head of state senior general than shwe said the states and divisions concerned are to put 50,000 acres 200 km under the physic nut plants jatropha each within three years totalling 700,000 acres 2,800 km during the period on the occasion of burmas peasant day 2006 than shwe described in his a message that for energy sector which is an essential role in transforming industrial agriculture system the government is encouraging for cultivation of physic nut plants nationwide and the technical know how that can refine physic nuts to biodiesel has also identified he would like to urge peasants to cultivate physic nut plants on a commercial scale with major aims for emergence of industrial agriculture system for fulfilling rural electricity supply and energy needs for supporting rural areas development and import substitute economy 2005 from mrtv in 2006 the chief research officer at state-run myanma oil and gas enterprise said burma hoped to completely replace the countrys oil imports of 40,000 barrels a day with home-brewed jatropha-derived biofuel other government officials declared burma would soon start exporting jatropha oil despite the militarys efforts the jatropha campaign apparently has largely flopped in its goal of making burma self-sufficient in fuel 2006 from myawaddytv zgs bioenergy has started jatropha plantation projects in northern shan state the company has begun planting jatropha plants during late june 2007 and will start producing seeds by 2010 20 july 2007 from new light of myanmar controversiesedit as of 2011 skepticism about the miracle properties of jatropha has been voiced for example the idea that jatropha can be grown on marginal land is a red herring according to harry stourton business development director of uk-based sun biofuels which cultivates jatropha in mozambique and tanzania it does grow on marginal land but if you use marginal land youll get marginal yields he said3738 an august 2010 article warned about the actual utility and potential dangers of reliance on jatropha in kenya major concerns included its invasiveness which could disrupt local biodiversity as well as damage to water catchment areas39 jatropha curcas is lauded as being sustainable and that its production would not compete with food production but the jatropha plant needs water like every other crop to grow this could create competition for water between the jatropha and other edible food crops in fact jatropha requires five times more water per unit of energy than sugarcane and corn4041 other usesedit flowers the species is listed as a honey plantcitation needed

case with haiti where jatropha curcas grows prolifically and animal feed is in very short supply43 similarly metsiyen in the haitian culture dates back as a medicinal crop - thus the name metsiyenmedsiyen some suggest it calms the stomach43 some mention of metsiyen being used to ward off evil spirits in past haitian culture where voodoo has been losing adherents for christian faith43

sulfated castor oil is the only oil that completely disperses in water it is made by adding sulfuric acid to pure jatropha oil46 it was the first synthetic detergent after ordinary soap as this allows easy use for making bath oil products it is used in formulating lubricants softeners and dyeing assistants47 the seeds in the zone around misantla veracruz are very appreciated by the population as food once they have been boiled and roasted it is unclear if this is due to the existence of a non-toxic variety of jatropha in mexico and central america or if the seeds become edible once processed by cooking48 it is also similarly reported that jatropha seeds are edible once the embryo has been removed49 again it may be so because of these seeds coming from a local non-toxic variety hcn is
