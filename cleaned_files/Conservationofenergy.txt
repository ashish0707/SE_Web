conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constantit is said to be conserved over time1 energy can neither be created nor destroyed rather it transforms from one form to another for instance chemical energy can be converted to kinetic energy in the explosion of a stick of dynamite a consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist that is to say no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings2 contents 1 history 1.1

miletus c550 bce had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made however there is no particular reason to identify this with what we know today as mass-energy for example thales thought it was water empedocles 490430 bce wrote that in his universal system composed of four roots earth air water fire nothing comes to be or perishes3 instead these elements suffer continual rearrangement in 1605 simon stevinus was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that perpetual motion was impossible in 1638 galileo published his analysis of several situationsincluding the celebrated interrupted pendulumwhich can be described in modern language as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again essentially he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia the remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height that a moving body ascends to does not depend on the shape of the frictionless surface that the body is moving on in 1669 christian huygens published his laws of collision among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their linear momentums as well as the sum of their kinetic energies however the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time this led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental in his horologium oscillatorium he gave a much more explicit and clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion huygens study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle that the center of gravity of heavy objects cannot lift itself the fact that kinetic energy is scalar unlike linear momentum which is a vector and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of gottfried wilhelm leibniz it was leibniz during 16761689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with motion kinetic energy using huygens work on collision leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems of several masses mi each with velocity vi  i m i v i 2 displaystyle sum _im_iv_i2 was conserved so long as the masses did not interact he called this quantity the vis viva or living force of the system the principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction many physicists at that time such as newton held that the conservation of momentum which holds even in systems with friction as defined by the momentum i m i v i displaystyle sum _im_iv_i was the conserved vis viva it was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously given the proper conditions such as an elastic collision in 1687 isaac newton published his principia which was organized around the concept of force and momentum however the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book while fine for point masses were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies some other principles were also required daniel bernoulli the law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo johann and daniel bernoulli the former enunciated the principle of virtual work as used in statics in its full generality in 1715 while the later based his hydrodynamica published in 1738 on this single conservation principle daniels study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the bernoullis principle which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines and he gave a kinetic theory of gases and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas this focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics such as the dalemberts principle and lagrangian and hamiltonian formulations of mechanics milie du chtelet 1706 1749 proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy as distinct from momentum inspired by the theories of gottfried leibniz she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by willem s gravesande in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay each balls kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity the deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from equal to the initial potential energy earlier workers including newton and voltaire had all believed that energy so far as they understood the concept at all was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity according to this understanding the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped from in classical physics the correct formula is e k 1 2 m v 2 displaystyle e_kfrac 12mv2  where e k displaystyle e_k is the kinetic energy of an object m displaystyle m its mass and v displaystyle v its speed on this basis chtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms kinetic potential heat45 engineers such as john smeaton peter ewart carl holtzmann gustave-adolphe hirn and marc seguin recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of leibnizs principle the principle was also championed by some chemists such as william hyde wollaston academics such as john playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved this is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics but in the 18th and 19th centuries the fate of the lost energy was still unknown gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of vis viva in 1783 antoine lavoisier and pierre-simon laplace reviewed the two competing theories of vis viva and caloric theory6 count rumfords 1798 observations of heat generation during the boring of cannons added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat and as importantly that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat vis viva then started to be known as energy after the term was first used in that sense by thomas young in 1807 gaspard-gustave coriolis the recalibration of vis viva to 1 2 i m i v i 2 displaystyle frac 12sum _im_iv_i2 which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to work was largely the result of gaspard-gustave coriolis and jean-victor poncelet over the period 18191839 the former called the quantity quantit de travail quantity of work and the latter travail mcanique mechanical work and both championed its use in engineering calculation in a paper ber die natur der wrmegerman on the nature of heatwarmth published in the zeitschrift fr physik in 1837 karl friedrich mohr gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in the words besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only and this is called kraft energy or work it may appear according to circumstances as motion chemical affinity cohesion electricity light and magnetism and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others mechanical equivalent of heatedit this section needs additional citations for verification

in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the mechanical equivalent of heat the caloric theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable in the middle of the eighteenth century mikhail lomonosov a russian scientist postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat which rejected the idea of a caloric through the results of empirical studies lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid in 1798 count rumford benjamin thompson performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy his measurements refuted caloric theory but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt james prescott joule the mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the german surgeon julius robert von mayer in 1842.7 mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the dutch east indies where he found that his patients blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less oxygen and therefore less energy to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate he discovered that heat and mechanical work were both forms of energy and in 1845 after improving his knowledge of physics he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them8 joules apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat a descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate meanwhile in 1843 james prescott joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments in the most famous now called the joule apparatus a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate he showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle over the period 18401843 similar work was carried out by engineer ludwig a colding though it was little known outside his native denmark both joules and mayers work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was joules that eventually drew the wider recognition for the dispute between joule and mayer over priority see mechanical equivalent of heat priority in 1844 william robert grove postulated a relationship between mechanics heat light electricity and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations of a single force energy in modern terms in 1874 grove published his theories in his book the correlation of physical forces9 in 1847 drawing on the earlier work of joule sadi carnot and mile clapeyron hermann von helmholtz arrived at conclusions similar to groves and published his theories in his book ber die erhaltung der kraft on the conservation of force 1847.10 the general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication in 1850 william rankine first used the phrase the law of the conservation of energy for the principle11 in 1877 peter guthrie tait claimed that the principle originated with sir isaac newton based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica this is now regarded as an example of whig history12

removed november 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message main article massenergy equivalence matter is composed of such things as atoms electrons neutrons and protons it has intrinsic or rest mass in the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved einsteins 1905 theory of special relativity showed that it corresponds to an equivalent amount of rest energy this means that it can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of other non-material forms of energy for example kinetic energy potential energy and electromagnetic radiant energy when this happens as recognized in twentieth century experience rest mass is not conserved unlike the total mass or total energy all forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy for example an electron and a positron each have rest mass they can perish together converting their combined rest energy into photons having electromagnetic radiant energy but no rest mass if this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings then neither the total mass nor the total energy of the system will change the produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia and to any weight of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise likewise non-material forms of energy can perish into matter which has rest mass thus conservation of energy total including material or rest energy and conservation of mass total not just rest each still holds as an equivalent law in the nineteenth century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws conservation of energy in beta decayedit main article beta decay neutrinos in beta decay the discovery in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous rather than a discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus1314 this problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by enrico fermi who proposed the correct description of beta-decay as the emission of both an electron and an antineutrino which carries away the apparently missing energy1516 first law of thermodynamicsedit main article first law of thermodynamics for a closed thermodynamic system the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as q d u w displaystyle delta qmathrm d udelta w  or equivalently d u q w  displaystyle mathrm d udelta q-delta w where q displaystyle delta q is the quantity of energy added to the system by a heating process w displaystyle delta w is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to work done by the system on its surroundings and d u displaystyle mathrm d u is the change in the internal energy of the system the s before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the d u displaystyle mathrm d u increment of internal energy see inexact differential work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system while the internal energy u displaystyle u is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium thus the term heat energy for q displaystyle delta q means that amount of energy added as the result of heating rather than referring to a particular form of energy likewise the term work energy for w displaystyle delta w means that amount of energy lost as the result of work thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state but one cannot tell just from knowledge of the given present state how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system entropy is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work for a simple compressible system the work performed by the system may be written w p d v  displaystyle delta wpmathrm d v where p displaystyle p is the pressure and d v displaystyle dv is a small change in the volume of the system each of which are system variables in the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow so as to be called quasi-static and regarded as reversible the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature then the heat energy may be written q t d s  displaystyle delta qtmathrm d s where t displaystyle t is the temperature and d s displaystyle mathrm d s is a small change in the entropy of the system temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system if an open system in which mass may be exchanged with the environment has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers then the first law may be written17 d u q w u d m  displaystyle mathrm d udelta q-delta wudm where d m displaystyle dm is the added mass and u displaystyle u is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass measured in the surroundings before the process noethers theoremedit main article noethers theorem the conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories from a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of noethers theorem developed by emmy noether in 1915 and first published in 1918 the theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity if the theorys symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called energy the energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself philosophically this can be stated as nothing depends on time per se in other words if the physical system is invariant under the continuous symmetry of time translation then its energy which is canonical conjugate quantity to time is conserved conversely systems which are not invariant under shifts in time an example systems with time dependent potential energy do not exhibit conservation of energy unless we consider them to exchange energy with another external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again since any time-varying system can be embedded within a larger time-invariant system with the exception of the universe conservation can always be recovered by a suitable re-definition of what energy is and extending the scope of your system conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory including qed in the flat space-time relativityedit with the discovery of special relativity by henri poincar and albert einstein energy was proposed to be one component of an energy-momentum 4-vector each of the four components one of energy and three of momentum of this vector is separately conserved across time in any closed system as seen from any given inertial reference frame also conserved is the vector length minkowski norm which is the rest mass for single particles and the invariant mass for systems of particles where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculatedsee the article on invariant mass the relativistic energy of a single massive particle contains a term related to its rest mass in addition to its kinetic energy of motion in the limit of zero kinetic energy or equivalently in the rest frame of a massive particle or else in the center of momentum frame for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy the total energy of particle or object including internal kinetic energy in systems is related to its rest mass or its invariant mass via the famous equation e m c 2 displaystyle emc2  thus the rule of conservation of energy over time in special relativity continues to hold so long as the reference frame of the observer is unchanged this applies to the total energy of systems although different observers disagree as to the energy value also conserved and invariant to all observers is the invariant mass which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer and which is defined by the energymomentum relation in general relativity conservation of energy-momentum is expressed with the aid of a stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor the theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe quantum theoryedit in quantum mechanics energy of a quantum system is described by a self-adjoint or hermitian operator called the hamiltonian which acts on the hilbert space or a space of wave functions of the system if the hamiltonian is a time-independent operator emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the evolution of the system thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent the local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum noethers theorem for energy-momentum tensor operator note that due to the lack of the universal time operator in quantum theory the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle and merely holds in specific cases see uncertainty principle energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics see alsoedit energy quality energy transformation eternity of the world laws of thermodynamics lagrangian principles of energetics
