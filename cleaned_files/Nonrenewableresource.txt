a coal mine in wyoming united states coal produced over millions of years is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale a non-renewable resource also called a finite resource is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames an example is carbon-based organically-derived fuel the original organic material with the aid of heat and pressure becomes a fuel such as oil or gas earth minerals and metal ores fossil fuels coal petroleum natural gas and groundwater in certain aquifers are all considered non-renewable resources though individual elements are almost always conserved in contrast resources such as timber when harvested sustainably and wind used to power energy conversion systems are considered renewable resources largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans contents 1 earth minerals and metal ores 2 fossil fuels 3 nuclear fuels 4 renewable resources 5 economic models 6 see also 7 references 8 external links earth minerals and metal oresedit main articles mineral and ore further information mining earth minerals and metal ores are examples of non-renewable resources the metals themselves are present in vast amounts in earths crust and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by natural geological processes such as heat pressure organic activity weathering and other processes enough to become economically viable to extract these processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years through plate tectonics tectonic subsidence and crustal recycling the localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames there are certain rare earth minerals and elements that are more scarce and exhaustible than others these are in high demand in manufacturing particularly for the electronics industry most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the earths near-surface environment than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish die and are quickly buried fossil fuelsedit main article fossil fuel further information oil depletion natural resources such as coal petroleum crude oil and natural gas take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power see renewable energy an alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combinedcitation needed these sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable although their rate of formationreplenishment on the sea floor is not known however their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined at present the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable fossil fuels since the dawn of internal combustion engine technologies in the 17th century petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand as a result conventional infrastructure and transport systems which are fitted to combustion engines remain prominent throughout the globe the continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase global warming and cause more severe climate change1 nuclear fuelsedit rssing uranium mine is the longest-running and one of the largest open pit uranium mines in the world every year it produces eight percent of global uranium needs2 annual release of technologically enhancedconcentrated naturally occurring radioactive material uranium and thorium radioisotopes naturally found in coal and concentrated in heavybottom coal ash and airborne fly ash3 as predicted by ornl to cumulatively amount to 2.9 million tons over the 1937-2040 period from the combustion of an estimated 637 billion tons of coal worldwide4 main article nuclear fuel further information nuclear power proposed as renewable energy and peak uranium in 1987 the world commission on environment and development wced an organization set up by but independent from the united nations classified fission reactors that produce more fissile nuclear fuel than they consume -ie breeder reactors and when it is developed fusion power among conventional renewable energy sources such as solar and falling water5 the american petroleum institute likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable but that breeder reactor nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable before explaining that radioactive waste from used spent fuel rods remains dangerous and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years6 with the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy7 the use of nuclear technology relying on fission requires naturally occurring radioactive material as fuel uranium the most common fission fuel and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and mined in 19 countries8 this mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with fissionable uranium-235 which generates heat that is ultimately used to power turbines to generate electricity9 nuclear power provides about 6 of the worlds energy and 1314 of the worlds electricity10 nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous radioactive contamination as it relies upon unstable elements in particular nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of low and intermediate level waste lilw and 10,000 metric tons of high level waste hlw including spent fuel designated as waste each year worldwide11 issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained is highly hazardous to people and wildlife radiocontaminants in the environment can enter the food chain and become bioaccumulated12 internal or external exposure can cause mutagenic dna breakage producing teratogenic generational birth defects cancers and other damage the united nations unscear estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 millisievert msv from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the chernobyl disaster and the nuclear fuel cycle along with 2.0 msv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 msv from cosmic rays all exposures vary by location13 natural uranium radioisotopes in nuclear waste and naturally in the ground emits radiation for the prolonged period of 4.5 billion years or more14 and storage has risks of containment the storage of waste health implications and dangers of radioactive fuel continue to be a topic of debate resulting in a controversial and unresolved industry renewable resourcesedit main article renewable resource further information renewable energy and recycling the three gorges dam the largest renewable energy generating station in the world natural resources known as renewable resources are replaced by natural processes and forces persistent in the natural environment there are intermittent and reoccurring renewables and recyclable materials which are utilized during a cycle across a certain amount of time and can be harnessed for any number of cycles the production of goods and services by manufacturing products in economic systems creates many types of waste during production and after the consumer has made use of it the material is then either incinerated buried in a landfill or recycled for reuse recycling turns materials of value that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources again satellite map showing areas flooded by the three gorges reservoir compare november 7 2006 above with april 17 1987 below the energy station required the flooding of archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people and is causing significant ecological changes including an increased risk of landslides15 the dam has been a controversial topic both domestically and abroad16 the natural environment with soil water forests plants and animals are all renewable resources as long as they are adequately monitored protected and conserved sustainable agriculture is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal ecosystems over the long term the overfishing of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem endanger species and possibly even determine whether or not a fishery is sustainable for use by humans an unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete resource depletion17 the renewable energy from the sun wind wave biomass and geothermal energies are based on renewable resources renewable resources such as the movement of water hydropower tidal power and wave power wind and radiant energy from geothermal heat used for geothermal power and solar energy used for solar power are practically infinite and cannot be depleted unlike their non-renewable counterparts which are likely to run out if not used sparingly the potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 15 of world demand hydroelectric power can supply 13 of our total energy global needs geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need there is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over wind power could power all of humanitys needs alone solar currently supplies only 0.1 of our world energy needs but there is enough out there to power humanitys needs 4,000 times over the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.1819 renewable energy and energy efficiency are no longer niche sectors that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists the increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production as non-renewable resources decline this is reinforced by climate change concerns nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support for renewable energy these factors are commercializing renewable energy enlarging the market and growing demand the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard20 economic modelsedit in economics a non-renewable resource is defined as goods where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow21 david ricardo in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time he argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent the first model is defined by hotellings rule which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable resource management by harold hotelling it shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would under otherwise stable conditions lead to a depletion of the resource the rule states that this would lead to a net price or hotelling rent for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the rate of interest reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources the hartwicks rule provides an important result about the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source however nearly all metal prices have been declining over time in inflation adjusted terms because of a number of false assumptions in the above firstly metal resources are non-renewable but on a world scale largely inexhaustible this is because they are present throughout the earths crust on a vast scale far exceeding human demand on all time scales metal ores however are only extracted in those areas where nature has concentrated the metal in the crust to a level whereby it is locally economic to extract this also depends on the available technology for both finding the metal ores as well as extracting them which is constantly changing if the technology or demand changes vast amounts of metal previously ignored can become economically extractable this is why ricardos simplistic notion that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time has in fact turned out to be the opposite nearly all metal ores have decreased in inflation adjusted prices since well before the early 20th century the main reason he was wrong is that he assumed that metals are exhaustible on a world scale and he also misunderstood the effect of globally competing markets in human terms the amount of metal in the earths crust is essentially limitless it is only in localized areas that metal ores can become depleted as these local areas compete with extraction costs of resources elsewhere which does have ramifications for the sustainability of local economiescitation needed see
