of princeton university from 1972 to 1988 founded jstor7 jstor originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries especially research and university libraries due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals by digitizing many journal titles jstor allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically bowen initially considered using cd-roms for distribution8 however ira fuchs princeton universitys vice-president for computing and information technology convinced bowen that cd-rom was an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility for example all princetons administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989 the student dormitory network was completed in 1994 and campus networks like the one at princeton were in turn linked to larger networks such as bitnet and the internet jstor was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals jstor access improved based on feedback from its initial sites and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser special software was put in placewhere to make pictures and graphs clear and readable9 with the success of this limited project bowen and kevin guthrie then-president of jstor wanted to expand the number of participating journals they met with representatives of the royal society of london and an agreement was madeby whom to digitize the philosophical transactions of the royal society dating from its beginning in 1665 the work of adding these volumes to jstor was completed by december 2000.9 the andrew w mellon foundation funded jstor initially until january 2009 jstor operated as an independent self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in new york city and in ann arbor michigan then jstor merged with the nonprofit ithaka harbors inc10 - a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies1 contentedit

answer was 250 million18 aaron swartz incidentedit main article united states v aaron swartz see also aaron swartz jstor in late 2010 and early 2011 internet activist aaron swartz used mits data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of jstors collection of academic journal articles1920 when the bulk-download was discovered jstor employees initially placed a video camera in the room to film the mysterious visitor and left the relevant computer untouched once video was captured of the visitor the download was stopped and swartz identified rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him in june 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data1920 the articles that were downloaded by aaron were from scholarly journals which published scientific papers largely funded by public universities and taxpayer money the following month federal authorities charged swartz with several data theft-related crimes including wire fraud computer fraud unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer2122 prosecutors in the case claimed that swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on p2p file-sharing sites2023 swartz surrendered to authorities pleaded not guilty to all counts and was released on 100,000 bail in september 2012 us attorneys increased the number of charges against swartz from four to thirteen with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and 1 million in fines2425 the case still was pending when swartz committed suicide in january 2013.26 prosecutors dropped the charges after his death27 limitationsedit the availability of most journals on jstor is controlled by a moving wall which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on jstor this time period is specified by agreement between jstor and the publisher of the journal which usually is three to five years publishers may request that the period of a moving wall be changed or request discontinuation of coverage formerly publishers also could request that the moving wall be changed to a fixed walla specified date after which jstor would not add new volumes to its database as of november 2010update fixed wall agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers28 in 2010 jstor started adding current issues of certain journals through its current scholarship program29 increasing public accessedit beginning september 6 2011 jstor made public domain content freely available to the public3031 this early journal content program constitutes about 6 of jstors total content and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the united states and before 1870 in other countries303132 jstor stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time the swartz controversy and greg maxwells protest torrent of the same content led jstor to press ahead with the initiative3031 in january 2012 jstor started a pilot program register read offering limited no-cost access not open access to archived articles for individuals who register for the service at the conclusion of the pilot in january 2013 jstor expanded register read from an initial 76 publishers to include about 1,200 journals from over 700 publishers33 registered readers may read up to three articles online every two weeks but may not print or download pdfs34 this is done by placing up to 3 items on a shelf the shelf is under my jstor below my profile the 3 works can then be read online at any time an item cannot be removed from the shelf until it has been there for 14 days removing an old work from the shelf creates space for a new one but doing so means the old work can no longer be accessed until it is shelved again jstor is conducting a pilot program with wikipedia whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the wikipedia library as with a university library3536 useedit in 2012 jstor users performed nearly 152 million searches with more than 113 million article views and
