steam vapor being vented through a typical con edison orange and white stack on seventh avenue at west 20th street steam vapor such as this can be caused by a leak in con eds steam system which heats cools and provides power for buildings in manhattan up to east 89th and west 96th street or by cooler water contacting the outside of a steam pipe1 the new york city steam system is a district heating system which takes steam produced by steam generating stations and carries it under the streets of manhattan to heat cool or supply power to high rise buildings and businesses some new york businesses and facilities also use the steam for cleaning and disinfection the new york steam company began providing service in lower manhattan on march 3 1882.2 today consolidated edison operates the largest commercial steam system in the world3 the organization within con edison that is responsible for the systems operation is known as steam operations providing steam service to over 1,700 customers and serving commercial and residential establishments in manhattan from battery park to 96th street uptown on the west side and 89th street on the east side of manhattan4 roughly 24billion pounds 11,000,000t of steam flow through the system every year1 contents 1 effects on the environment 2 plants 3 see also 4 references 5 external links effects on the environmentedit cogeneration and heat recovery steam generation hrsg significantly increase the efficiency of fuel usage and thereby reduces the emission of pollutants such as nox sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and particulate matter and reduce the citys carbon footprint approximately 30 of the coned steam systems installed capacity and 50 of the annual steam generated comes from cogeneration5 con edison is promoting the use of steam for cooling in the summer months something that can be accomplished with the installation of absorption chillers6 such trigeneration systems result in additional energy and pollution savings while reducing peak electrical loads clouds of condensation can sometimes be seen rising from manholes in manhattan through orange and white chimneys this can be caused by external water being boiled by contact with the steam pipes or by leaks in the steam system itself1 at least 12 steam pipe explosions have occurred in new york city since 1987.7 the most recent incident was the 2007 new york city steam explosion another major incident occurred on june 28 1996 at the plant on east 75th street8 plantsedit map all coordinates using osm map all coordinates using google map up to 200 coordinates using bing export all coordinates as kml export all coordinates as georss export all coordinates as gpx map all microformatted coordinates place data as rdf east 74th street plant west 59th street plant east 74th street station at fdr drive 404601n 735703w 40.7668749n 73.9508952w 40.7668749 -739508952 60th street station at york ave 404535n 735732w 40.7598303n 73.9589127w 40.7598303 -739589127 59th street station at 11th ave irt powerhouse 404608n 735930w 40.7689531n 73.991624w 40.7689531 -73991624 east river station 14th st and fdr cogeneration 404340n 735824w 40.7277782n 73.9732059w 40.7277782 -739732059 bnycp plant brooklyn navy yard cogeneration partners cogeneration 404158n 735834w 40.699314n 73.976086w 40.699314 -73976086 ravenswood a house steam station queens 404522n 735701w 40.7561804n 73.9503086w 40.7561804 -739503086 see alsoedit cogeneration district heating holly steam combination company 2007 new york city steam explosion referencesedit notes a b c steam operations faq on the con edison website a brief history of con edison con edison retrieved 2014-05-04 httpwwwnytimescom20141010nyregionmiles-of-steam-pipes-snake-beneath-new-yorkhtml_r0 1 con edison steam long range plan 2010-2030 p 69 benefits and case studies of hybrid cooling using steam consolidated edison belson ken and depalma anthony asbestos and aging pipes remain buried hazards the new york times july 19 2007 raffa frank con-ed blows off some steam fdnewyorkcom retrieved february 20 2014 external linksedit con edison steam operations con ed history gotham gazette article on steam
