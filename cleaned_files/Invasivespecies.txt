through their dams kudzu a japanese vine species invasive in the southeast united states growing in atlanta georgia an invasive species is a plant fungus or animal species that is not native to a specific location an introduced species and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment human economy or human health1dubious discuss one study pointed out widely divergent perceptions of the criteria for invasive species among researchers p135 and concerns with the subjectivity of the term invasive p1362 some of the alternate usages of the term are below the term as most often used applies to introduced species also called non-indigenous or non-native that adversely affect the habitats and bioregions they invade economically environmentally or ecologically such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region wilderness areas particular habitats or wildlandurban interface land from loss of natural controls such as predators or herbivores this includes non-native invasive plant species labeled as exotic pest plants and invasive exotics growing in native plant communities3 it has been used in this sense by government organizations45 as well as conservation groups such as the international union for conservation of nature iucn and the california native plant society2 the european union defines invasive alien species as those that are firstly outside their natural distribution area and secondly threaten biological diversity6 it is also used by land managers botanists researchers horticulturalists conservationists and the public for noxious weeds7 the kudzu vine pueraria lobata andean pampas grass cortaderia jubata and yellow starthistle centaurea solstitialis are examples an alternate usage broadens the term to include indigenous or native species along with non-native species that have colonized natural areas p1362 deer are an example considered to be overpopulating their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens by some in the northeastern and pacific coast regions of the united statescitation needed sometimes the term is used to describe a non-native or introduced species that has become widespread p1362 however not every introduced species has adverse effects on the environment a nonadverse example is the common goldfish carassius auratus which is found throughout the united states but rarely achieves high densities p1362 contents 1 causes 1.1 species-based mechanisms 1.2 ecosystem-based mechanisms 2 ecology 2.1 traits of invaded ecosystems 2.2

external links causesedit scientists include species- and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that when combined establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species species-based mechanismsedit while all species compete to survive invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete native species in some cases the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction in other cases species interact with each other more directly researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers one study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species 86 of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone8 another study found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of the presumed traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species requiring other explanations8910 common invasive species traits include the following fast growth rapid reproduction high dispersal ability phenotypic plasticity the ability to alter growth form to suit current conditions tolerance of a wide range of environmental conditions ecological competence ability to live off of a wide range of food types generalist association with humans11 prior successful invasions12 typically an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location13 at low population densities it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established repeated patterns of human movement such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment also known as a high propagule pressure14 an introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as nutrients light physical space water or food if these species evolved under great competition or predation then the new environment may host fewer able competitors allowing the invader to proliferate quickly ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as zero-sum systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native however such unilateral competitive superiority and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader is not the rule1516 invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time and gradually the superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location lantana growing in abandoned citrus plantation moshav sdei hemed israel an invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species such as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types for example barbed goatgrass aegilops triuncialis was introduced to california on serpentine soils which have low water-retention low nutrient levels a high magnesiumcalcium ratio and possible heavy metal toxicity plant populations on these soils tend to show low density but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils17 invasive species might alters its environment by releasing chemical compounds modifying abiotic factors or affecting the behaviour of herbivores creating a positive or negative impact on other species some species like kalanchoe daigremontana produce allelopathic compounds that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species other species like stapelia gigantea facilitates the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development18 another examples are centaurea solstitialis yellow starthistle and centaurea diffusa diffuse knapweed these eastern european noxious weeds have spread through the western and west coast states experiments show that 8-hydroxyquinoline a chemical produced at the root of c diffusa has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses c diffusa and c solstitialis do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others conversely examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness1920 changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation bromus tectorum originally from eurasia is highly fire-adapted it not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity heat of fires by providing large amounts of dry detritus during the fire season in western north america in areas where it is widespread it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires allowing b tectorum to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range21 facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species for example zebra mussels increase habitat complexity on lake floors providing crevices in which invertebrates live this increase in complexity together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel filter-feeding increases the density and diversity of benthic invertebrate communities22 ecosystem-based mechanismsedit in ecosystems the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem in stable ecosystems equilibrium exists in the use of available resources these mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem23 when changes such as a forest fire occur normal succession favors native grasses and forbs an introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species squeezing them out nitrogen and phosphorus are often the limiting factors in these situations24 every species occupies a niche in its native ecosystem some species fill large and varied roles while others are highly specialized some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species and they also can create new nichescitation needed an example of this type can be found within the lampropholis delicata species of skink ecosystem changes can alter species distributions for example edge effects describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture the boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitatcitation needed one interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments when bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation25 the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance this conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution26 following invasion events selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment these responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey27 adaptations include changes in morphology physiology phenology and plasticity rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment intraspecific phenotypic plasticity pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution28 plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment this is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced the ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species if the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced it is more likely to fare better in the new environment this in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive ecologyedit traits of invaded ecosystemsedit in 1958 charles s elton29 claimed that ecosystems with higher species diversity were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion30 this debate hinged on the spatial scale at which invasion studies were performed and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011 small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse the latter result may be a side-effect of invasives ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered3132 the brown tree snake boiga irregularis invasion was more likely in ecosystems that were similar to the one in which the potential invader evolved33 island ecosystems may be more prone to invasion because their species faced few strong competitors and predators or because their distance from colonizing species populations makes them more likely to have open niches34 an example of this phenomenon was the decimation of native bird populations on guam by the invasive brown tree snakecitation needed conversely invaded ecosystems may lack the natural competitors and predators that check invasives growth in their native ecosystems invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance typically human-induced11 such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem13 vectorsedit non-native species have many vectors including biogenic vectors but most invasions are associated with human activity natural range extensions are common in many species but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces35 an early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the pacific rat rattus exulans to polynesia36 chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis vectors include plants or seeds imported for horticulture the pet trade moves animals across borders where they can escape and become invasive organisms stow away on transport vehicles ballast water taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions37 38 around the world on the average day more than 3,000 different species of aquatic life may be transported on these vessels39 for example freshwater zebra mussels native to the black caspian and azov seas probably reached the great lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel40 although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988 and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter the plan had and continued to have as of 2005 a serious flaw or loophole whereby ships that are loaded with cargo when they reach the seaway need not be tested but all the same they transfer ballast puddles between seaway ports41 the arrival of invasive propagules to a new site is a function of the sites invasibility42 species have also been introduced intentionally for example to feel more at home american colonists formed acclimation societies that repeatedly imported birds that were native to europe to north america and other distant lands in 2008 us postal workers in pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from taiwan the box contained more than two dozen live beetles agricultural research service entomologists identified them as rhinoceros beetle hercules beetle and king stag beetle43 because these species were not native to the us they could have threatened native ecosystems to prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the us special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries usda programs such as smuggling interdiction and trade compliance sitc attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in america economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction high demand for the valuable chinese mitten crab is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waterscitation needed impacts of wildfireedit invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem wildfires roads foot trails to colonize an area large wildfires can sterilize soils while adding a variety of nutrients24 in the resulting free-for-all formerly entrenched species lose their advantage leaving more room for invasives in such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout21 impact of wildfire suppression on spreadingedit wildfires often occur in remote areas needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site the crews can bring invasive seeds with them if any of these stowaway seeds become established a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread also disturbing the soil surface such as cutting firebreaks destroys native cover exposes soil and can accelerate invasions in suburban and wildland-urban interface areas the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for defensible space can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant speciescitation needed fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks as the vehicles are often driven on back roads often overgrown with invasive plant species the undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport in response on large fires washing stations decontaminate vehicles before engaging in suppression activitiescitation needed large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places further increasing the potential for seed transportcitation needed effectsedit an american alligator attacking a burmese python in florida the burmese python is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species including the alligator ecologicaledit land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems changing ecosystem functions a species of wetland plant known as aeae in hawaii the indigenous bacopa monnieri is regarded as a pest species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered hawaiian stilt himantopus mexicanus knudseni making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish examples of this are the introductions of the amethyst gem clam gemma gemma and the european green crab carcinus maenas the gem clam was introduced into californias bodega harbor from the east coast of the united states a century ago it had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species nutricola spp in the mid-1990s the introduction of the european green crab found to prey preferentially on the native clams resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations44 in the waterberg region of south africa cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original grassland resulting in a massive reduction in forage for native bovids and other grazers since the 1970s large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region examples of these species are giraffe blue wildebeest impala kudu and white rhino invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems for example invasive plants can alter the fire regimen cheatgrass bromus tectorum nutrient cycling smooth cordgrass spartina alterniflora and hydrology tamarix in native ecosystems45 invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species4647 for example hybridization with introduced cordgrass spartina alterniflora threatens the existence of california cordgrass spartina foliosa in san francisco bay48 invasive species cause competition for native species and because of this 400 of the 958 endangered species under the endangered species act are at risk49 geomorphologicaledit primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection for example kudzu pueraria montana a vine native to asia was widely introduced in the southeastern usa in the early 20th century to control soil erosion while primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation bioerosion and bioconstruction for example invasion of chinese mitten crab eriocheir sinensis have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates50 economicedit economic opportunitiesedit some invasions offer potential commercial benefits for instance silver carp and common carp can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product or processed into pet foods or mink feed water hyacinth can be turned into fuel by methane digesters51 and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of bioenergy52 benefitsedit non-native species can have benefits asian oysters for example filter water pollutants better than nativeclarification needed oysters they also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives biologists are currently considering releasing this mollusk in the chesapeake bay to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution a recent study by the johns hopkins school of public health found the asian oyster could significantly benefit the bays deteriorating water quality53 additionally some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment for example l leucozonium shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in north america54 has become an important pollinator of caneberry as well as cucurbit apple trees and blueberry bushes55 invasivorismedit invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system in response invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control reduce or eliminate their populations chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients miyas of new haven connecticut created the first invasive species menu in the world56 skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new placesuch as the indo-pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the western atlantic caribbean and gulf of mexicoeradication is almost impossible critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely57 a dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at fish fish of miami florida proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction - such as the dodo bird the caribbean monk seal and the passenger pigeon proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of lionfish by encouraging the consumption of the fish58 costsedit economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry and management costs estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the us alone amount to more than 138billion annually59 economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues60 when economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs they are low because they do not consider environmental damage if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species loss in biodiversity and loss of ecosystem services costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase59 the following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions plant industryedit weeds reduce yield in agriculture though they may provide essential nutrients some deep-rooted weeds can mine nutrients see dynamic accumulator from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants threaten young cattle eg leafy spurge euphorbia esula or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines eg yellow starthistle forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly us1billion in the us alone59 a decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by honey bees infected by the invasive varroa mite introduced rats rattus rattus and r norvegicus have become serious pests on farms destroying stored grains59 invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive asian citrus psyllid acp because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where acp has been found61 aquacultureedit aquaculture is a very common vector of species introductions mainly of species with economic potential eg oreochromis niloticus62 forestryedit see also wilding conifer poster asking campers to not move firewood around avoiding the spread of invasive species the unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change forest ecology and damage the timber industry overall forest ecosystems in the us are widely invaded by exotic pests plants and pathogens6364 the asian long-horned beetle anoplophora glabripennis was first introduced into the us in 1996 and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees as of 2005 thirty million dollars had been spent in attempts to eradicate this pest and protect millions of trees in the affected regions59 the woolly adelgid has inflicted damage on old-growth spruce fir and hemlock forests and damages the christmas tree industry65 and the chestnut blight fungus cryphonectria parasitica and dutch elm disease ophiostoma novo-ulmi are two plant pathogens with serious impacts on these two species and forest health66 garlic mustard alliaria petiolata is one of the most problematic invasive plant species in eastern north american forests the characteristics of garlic mustard are slightly different from those of the surrounding native plants which results in a highly successful species that is altering the composition and function of the native communities it invades when garlic mustard invades the understory of a forest it affects the growth rate of tree seedlings which is likely to alter forest regeneration of impact forest composition in the future67 tourism and recreationedit invasive species can impact outdoor recreation such as fishing hunting hiking wildlife viewing and water-based activities they can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation including but not limited to water quality and quantity plant and animal diversity and species abundance68 eiswerth states very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions states and watersheds eurasian watermilfoil myriophyllum spicatum in parts of the us fill lakes with plants complicating fishing and boating69 the very loud call of the introduced common coqui depresses real estate values in affected neighborhoods of hawaii70 healthedit encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as hiv59 to the wider population introduced birds eg pigeons rodents and insects eg mosquito flea louse and tsetse fly pests can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions the introduced chinese mitten crabs are carriers of asian lung fluke71 throughout recorded history epidemics of human diseases such as malaria yellow fever typhus and bubonic plague spread via these vectors29 a recent example of an introduced disease is the spread of the west nile virus which killed humans birds mammals and reptiles72 waterborne disease agents such as cholera bacteria vibrio cholerae and causative agents of harmful algal blooms are often transported via ballast water73 invasive species and accompanying control efforts can have long term public health implications for instance pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water59 biodiversityedit main article biodiversity biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global biodiversity loss and is increasing because of tourism and globalizationcitation needed this may be particularly true in inadequately regulated fresh water systems though quarantines and ballast water rules have improved the situation74 invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via competitive exclusion niche displacement or hybridisation with related native species therefore besides their economic ramifications alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the worlds fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity75 nevertheless it is difficult to unequivocally attribute extinctions to a species invasion and the few scientific studies that have done so have been with animal taxa concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence either ecological or economic in relation to the potential riskcitation needed alien invasive species parthenium hysterophorus smothering native flora in achanakmar tiger reserve bilaspur chhattisgarh india genetic pollutionedit main article genetic pollution native species can be threatened with extinction76 through the process of genetic pollution genetic pollution is unintentional hybridization and introgression which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical or fitness advantage of the introduced species77 genetic pollution can operate either through introduction or through habitat modification bringing previously isolated species into contact hybrids resulting from rare species that interbreed with abundant species can swamp the rarer species gene pool this is not always apparent from morphological observations alone some degree of gene flow is normal and preserves constellations of genes and genotypes7879 an example of this is the interbreeding of migrating coyotes with the red wolf in areas of eastern north carolina where the red wolf was reintroducedcitation needed studyedit see also invasion biology terminology stage

the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of ecology and geography where the issue of biological invasions is especially important much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by charles eltons 1958 book the ecology of invasion by animals and plants which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions8081 studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day81 this research which has largely consisted of field observational studies has disproportionately been concerned with terrestrial plants81 the rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events despite this little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as invasion ecology or more generally invasion biology8081 this lack of standard terminology is a significant problem and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture zoology and pathology as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another80 in an attempt to avoid the ambiguous subjective and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers colautti and macisaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on biogeography rather than on taxa82 by discarding taxonomy human health and economic factors this model focused only on ecological factors the model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species it classified each population based on its success in that environment this model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful see alsoedit applied ecology ballast water discharge and the environment beaver
