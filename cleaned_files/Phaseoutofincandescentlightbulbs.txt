magnetic induction light bulb governments around the world have passed measures to phase out incandescent light bulbs for general lighting in favor of more energy-efficient lighting alternatives phase-out regulations effectively ban the manufacture importation or sale of incandescent light bulbs for general lighting the regulations would allow sale of future versions of incandescent bulbs if they are sufficiently energy efficient brazil and venezuela started the controversial phase-out in 2005,citation needed and the european union switzerland1 and australia2 started to phase them out in 2009.3 likewise other nations are implementing new energy standards or have scheduled phase-outs argentina4 and russia in 2012 and the united states canada5 mexico malaysia6 and south korea in 2014.7 objections to replacement of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs to mitigate the effects of these concerns various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release new lamp types offer improved starting characteristics and dimmable types are available contents 1

spectral distribution that is the bulb as the filament heats up produces light from wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum alternative light sources use phosphors or combinations of mono-chromatic leds red blue green to produce white light giving significantly irregular spectral distributions which can result in color casts in photography and differences of color matching when compared to incandescent light or daylight8citation needed halogen lamps are a type of incandescent lamp with improved efficiency over regular incandescent lamps though not as energy efficient as other alternatives they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life9 depending on size voltage and designed life small low-voltage halogen lamps can have 70 higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps the high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications a compact fluorescent lamp cfl uses a fluorescent lamp tube which is curved or folded to fit into the space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light cfls use one-fifth to one-third the electric power and may last eight to fifteen times longer10 newer phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color with soft white cfls judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps11 objections more specifically relating to compact fluorescent light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps12 and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of mercury a potent neurotoxin which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed in the event of a breakage indoors13 environmental concerns about mercury contamination from cfls have been raised1415 but cfls can be shown to result in less mercury in the environment compared to traditional incandescent bulbs due to the significant reductions in power plant emissions thus use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment16 compact fluorescent lamps start poorly when very cold and most types cannot be dimmed a few specialist applications are unsuitable for cfls light emitting diode led lamps are used for both general and special-purpose lighting compared to fluorescent bulbs advantages17 are that they contain no mercury they turn on instantly at any temperature their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off they have no glass to break they dont emit uv rays that fade colored materials18 led lamps radiate almost no heat and can be either multi-directional or uni-directional eliminating the need for a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture19 led lamps can emit saturated colored light disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs magnetic induction lights use a magnetic field to excite mercury to give off uv light which is converted to visible light by a phosphor coating20 they can last 15,000 hours and produce more than 60 lumens per watt2122 the technology has been used in industrial lighting since 1990.23 regional developmentsedit phase out of incandescent light bulbs around the world a full ban a partial ban a programme to exchange a number of light bulbs with more efficient types africaedit south africaedit south africa is in stage of phasing out incandescent light bulbs in 2016.24 zambiaedit since january 2016 the importation of incandescent light bulbs has been banned in zambia25 asiaedit peoples republic of chinaedit china will ban imports and sales of certain incandescent light bulbs starting october 2012 to encourage the use of alternative lighting sources such as light-emitting diodes leds with a 5-year plan of phasing-out incandescent light bulbs over 100 watts starting 1 october 2012 and gradually extend the ban to those over 15 watts on 1 october 2016.26 another source however has indicated that by 1 october 2016 all incandescent light bulbs will be banned27 according to this source 1 november 2011 to 30 september 2012 will be a transitional period and as of 1 october 2012 imports and sales of ordinary incandescent bulbs of 100 watts or more will be prohibited the first phase will be followed by a ban on 60-watt-and-higher incandescent light bulbs starting in october 2014 by october 2016 all incandescent light bulbs will be banned in china the final phase may be adjusted according to the results of interim assessment from october 2015 to october 2016 indiaedit while not a complete ban the plan was to replace 770 million incandescent light bulbs with led by 2019 under ujala scheme under piyush goyal leadership the energy savings and resultant carbon emissions savings is expected to be around 110 million tonnes per year and reduce the energy consumption only on the lighting side street and home lights by 112 billion units or 11,000 crore units resulting in a savings of 40,000 crore for the consumers or about 6.5 billion in electricity bills of consumers the states of tamil nadu and karnataka in india have banned the use of incandescent bulbs in government departments public sector undertakings various boards cooperative institutions local bodies and institutions running on government aid2829 philippinesedit in february 2008 president gloria macapagal arroyo called for a ban of incandescent light bulbs by 2010 in favor of more energy-efficient fluorescent globes to help cut greenhouse gas emissions and household costs during her closing remarks at the philippine energy summit once put in effect the country will be the first in asia to do so30 malaysiaedit the government will stop all production import and sales of incandescent light bulbs by or before january 2014 as part of efforts to save power and to help cut greenhouse gas emissions6 israeledit phase out of 60w and over incandescent light bulbs has been implemented from 1 january 2012 as a measure to increase awareness a national awareness campaign has been initiated by the ministry of energy where three cfls will be sold at a subsidized price to the public31 europeedit european unionedit the uk government announced in 2007 that incandescent bulbs would be phased out by 2011.32 in 2008 the irish government announced a phase-out of the sale of any light bulbs with a luminous efficiency of less than 16 lumens per watt33 shortly afterwards all member states of the eu agreed to a progressive phase-out of incandescent light bulbs by 2012.34 the initial europe wide ban only applied to general-purpose non-directional incandescent bulbs so did not affect any bulbs with reflective surfaces eg spotlights and halogen down lighters or special purpose bulbs including those used in devices such as household appliances traffic lights infrared lamps and automotive lighting the sale of the most inefficient bulbs was phased out the first types to go were non-clear frosted bulbs which were taken off the market in september 2009 also from september 2009 clear bulbs over 100 w were made of more efficient types this limit was moved down to lower wattages and the efficiency levels raised by the end of 2012.35 in practice some manufacturers and retailers have found a loophole in the new rules so that some incandescents are still available marketed as rough-service or shock-resistant bulbs for industrial use only such bulbs are widely available in markets and hardware stores at much lower cost than official alternatives such as cfls they also offer improved safety for users by having a faster reaction time and so users can see hazards when entering a room for example36 since first bans were introduced however prices of these bulbs have risen by 2025.37 a german importer simply reclassified the lamps as mini heaters38 branded heatballs but that was banned shortly afterwards39 the eu set a target of 2016 to phase out halogen bulbs with two directives ec 2442009 and ec 11942012 the phase out of the first directive ec 2442009 originally planned for september 2016 was delayed until september 2018.40 the second directive ec 11942012 was upheld as part of a review of the lighting directive four criteria needed to be assessed before a phase-out could be confirmed issues of affordability were under scrutiny as well as performance equivalence to existing models and compatibility the eu confirmed that there was absolutely no reason to delay the ban on mains voltage directional halogen lamps as all four of the criteria had been sufficiently met41 the directive ec 11942012 relates to mains voltage directional halogen lamps and means many common halogen reflector lamps such as d rated gu10s are affected42 norwayedit norway has implemented the eu directive for the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs and has followed the same phase out route as the eu there was a half-year delay in implementing the directive compared to the eu but the phase out occurred at the same time since the affected light bulbs were no longer available from european sources switzerlandedit switzerland banned the sale of all light bulbs of the energy efficiency class f and g which affects a few types of incandescent light bulbs most normal light bulbs are of energy efficiency class e and the swiss regulation has exceptions for various kinds of special-purpose and decorative bulbs143 north americaedit canadaedit the provincial government of nova scotia stated in february 2007 that it would like to move towards preventing the sale of incandescent light bulbs in the province44 in april 2007 ontarios minister of energy dwight duncan announced the provincial governments intention to ban the sale of incandescent light bulbs by 2012.45 later in april the federal government announced that it would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs nationwide by 2012 as part of a plan to cut down on emissions of greenhouse gases46 on 9 nov 2011 the federal government approved a proposal to delay new energy efficiency standards for light bulbs until 1 january 2014 when it will become illegal to import inefficient incandescent lighting across the country4748 in december 2011 ontario energy minister chris bentley confirmed that ontario is scrapping the five-year-old plan to avoid confusing consumers49 the energy star program in which natural resources canada is a partner in march 2008 established rules for labelling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency starting time life expectancy colour and consistency of performance the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products50 those cfls with a recent energy star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker in january 2011 the province of british columbia banned retailers from ordering 75- or 100-watt incandescent bulbs51 canadas energy efficiency regulations are published on the natural resources canada website52 the canadian federal government banned the import and sale of 75- and 100-watt incandescent bulbs effective 1 january 2014 on 1 january 2015 40- and 60-watt bulbs were also banned retailers will be allowed to sell their existing inventories imported before the bans53 cubaedit cuba exchanged all incandescent light bulbs for cfls and banned the sale and import of them in 2005.citation needed united statesedit see also us lighting energy policy individual state effortsedit california will phase out the use of incandescent bulbs by 2018 the bill aims to establish a minimum standard of twenty-five lumens per watt by 2013 and sixty lumens per watt by 2018.5455 in connecticut legislation was proposed5657 a bill was introduced in new jersey in 2007 that calls for the state to eliminate incandescent bulbs in government buildings over the next three years58 federal legislationedit this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information february 2016 in december 2007 the federal government enacted the energy independence and security act of 2007 which contains legislation to make incandescent light bulbs more efficient by setting maximum wattage requirements for all general service incandescent light bulbs producing 3102600 lumens of light light bulbs outside of this range are exempt from the restrictions also exempt are several classes of specialty lights including appliance lamps rough service bulbs 3-way colored lamps stage lighting plant lights candelabra lights under 60 watts outdoor post lights less than 100 watts nightlights and shatter resistant bulbs this effectively banned the manufacturing or importing of most incandescent bulbs of that time5960 the timeline for these standards was to start in january 2012 by 2020 a second tier of restrictions would become effective which require all general-purpose bulbs to produce at least 45 lumens per watt similar to current cfls61 the united states environmental protection agencys energy star program in march 2008 established rules for labeling lamps that meet a set of standards for efficiency starting time life expectancy color and consistency of performance the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns about efficient light bulbs due to variable quality of products50 those cfls with a recent energy star certification start in less than one second and do not flicker energy star light bulbs for consumers is a resource for finding and comparing energy star qualified lamps in 2011 republican house members introduced a better use of light bulbs act or bulb act hr 91 which would have repealed subtitle b of title iii of the energy independence and security act of 2007.62 hr 2417 failed to pass in the us house63 on 16 december 2011 the us house passed the final 2012 budget legislation which effectively delayed the implementation until october 2012.64 in 2014 the spending bill proposed by the house would blockneeds update the energy efficiency standards in the energy independence and security act of 2007 which would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete65 oceaniaedit australiaedit in february 2007 australia enacted a law that will in effect by legislating efficiency standards disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010.66 the australian federal government announced minimum energy performance standards meps for lighting products the new minimum standard efficiency level is 15 lumens per watt lmw from november 2008 no non-compliant lighting including some incandescent globes were imported into australia and from november 2009 the retail sale of non-compliant lighting was banned67 according to the current proposal68 all regular light bulbs and some other kinds of light bulbs sold from october 2009 have to meet the new minimum energy performance standards incandescent light bulbs that meet the new standards for example high-efficiency halogen bulbs continue to be available69 it is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions will be cut by 800,000 tonnes australias current emission total is 564.7 million tonnes a saving of approximately 0.14.70 there have been some initiatives to encourage people to switch to compact fluorescent lamps ahead of the phase out71 new zealandedit in february 2007 then climate change minister david parker labour party announced a similar proposal to the one in australia72 except that importation for personal use would have been allowed73 however this proposal was scrapped by the new government in december 2008.74 south americaedit argentinaedit in argentina selling and importing incandescent light bulbs has been forbidden since 31 december 2010.75 braziledit as specified in interministerial ordinance 1,007 of 31 december 2010 incandescent light bulbs must perform according to certain levels of luminous efficacy in order to be produced imported and sold in brazil76 non-conforming light bulbs are being gradually phased out as of july 2013 bulbs ranging from 61 to 100 watts which do not perform accordingly can no longer be produced nor imported but until mid-2014 they can still be sold77 since end of june 2016 it has been completely prohibited in brazil78 chileedit the chilean government has prohibited the manufacture import and sale of incandescent bulbs since december 2015.79 venezuelaedit as part of its electricity conservation program venezuela has a light bulb exchange program which aims to replace millions of incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents80 public oppositionedit the phase out has been referred to as light bulb socialism81 the consumer preference for light bulbs in the eu is for incandescent bulbs with many complaining about what was described as the ugliness8283 or the cold flat unnatural dull light emanating from cfls818485868788 objection has also been raised to being forced to adopt cfls89 bulk purchasing of incandescent bulbs was reported ahead of the eu lightbulb ban many retailers in britain poland austria germany and hungary have reported bulk purchasing8284909192 and in germany sales rose by up to 150 in 2009 in comparison to 2008.81 two-thirds of austrians surveyed stated they believe the phase-out to be nonsensical with 53.6 believing their health to be at risk of mercury poisoning93 72 of americans believe the government has no right to dictate which light bulb they may use94 the czech republic president vaclav klaus urged people to stockpile enough incandescent bulbs to last their lifetime95 museums and individuals have been stockpiling incandescent lightbulbs in europe owing to cfls inferior colour representation8696 the european association for the co-ordination of consumer representation in standardisation anec has called for a speedy reduction of the mercury levels contained within cfls from the current 5mg limit to 1mg.97 the european consumers organisation beuc said that phasing out incandescent bulbs will be detrimental for people suffering light-related health issues98 and called for the continued availability of incandescent bulbs the eu regulation falls short of the needs of some consumers who need to use the old-style light bulbs for health-related reasons such as light sensitivity we call on the european commission to take immediate measures to ensure that people who rely on incandescent light bulbs will be able to buy these bulbs until suitable alternative lighting technologies are available there are also concerns about the risks to health from the high mercury content of the new bulbs99 a campaign group called spectrum was formed by the charities lupus uk eclipse support group es-uk xp support group and the skin care campaign as an alliance for light sensitivity to oppose uk and eu plans to phase out incandescent lightbulbs100 their campaign has been picked up and amplified by the british association of dermatologists calling for access to incandescent light bulbs for those who are medically sensitive to cfls and other non-incandescent bulbs101 and the charity migraine action stating that its members still suffer adverse effects from cfls despite protestations from the light bulb industry102 in the united states one supporter of the incandescent light bulb is the lighting designer howard brandston103 a fellow of the illuminating engineering society of north america and honorary fellow of the chartered institution of building services engineers he has attempted to raise awareness of what he believes are negative effects of the phase out through media outlets and industry forums104105106107 and he was invited as one of six experts to testify before the us senate committee on energy and natural resources on 11 march 2011.108109 environmental and health concernsedit main article compact fluorescent lamp health issues cfls like all fluorescent lamps contain small amounts of mercury as both vapor and droplets inside the glass tubing averaging 4.0mg per bulb110 the inclusion of liquid mercury is specifically prohibited from other domestic products in some jurisdictions notably europe111112 safe cleanup of broken compact fluorescent lamps is different from cleanup of conventional broken glass or incandescent bulbs113 after a proper cleanup any potential short term exposure offers no significant health risks to adults including pregnant women or to children114 if all electricity was generated by a coal power plant which produce about half the electricity the us consumes and fluorescent light bulbs were all recycled with no mercury being lost nearly 75 less mercury could be released in power plant emissions if incandescent bulbs were replaced by fluorescents and with significantly less total mercury release even if no recycling occurred115 however a concern is that broken bulbs will introduce the mercury directly into a populated indoor area116 though more recent analysis indicates that the concerns about mercury release from broken bulbs may be overstated and can be ameliorated by taking a few simple steps117 no mercury is used in the manufacturing of led lamps a different technology replacement for incandescent lamps118 in addition led lamps do not require warmup time in cold weather and in fact perform better in colder temperatures making them an excellent choice for use in cold locations such as refrigeration units119 costedit the initial cost of cfls and leds are higher than that of incandescent light bulbs typically this extra cost is repaid in the long-term as both use less energy120 and have longer operating lives than incandescent bulbs when bulbs are used infrequently such as in little-used closets and attics it may take a long time to compensate for the higher initial cost of the bulb121 heating and coolingedit main article compact fluorescent lamp heating and cooling the overall energy savings from changing to more efficient lighting depends on the climate in warm climates efficient lighting has the additional energy-saving effect of reducing the amount of cooling required in cold climates increased heating energy demand may offset some of the lighting energy saved with efficient lighting122 a report published in january 2008 found that in los angeles where incandescent lighting results in increased air conditioning electricity savings would pay for the initial cost of cfls four times faster than in vancouver where incandescent lighting contributes to space heating123 in all climates there is a net cost saving from changing to compact fluorescent lighting123 the cost of cfl and led bulbs has declined greatly since 2008 which shortens the time needed to pay off their initial cost while the excessive heat produced by incandescent light bulbs is frequently seen as a drawback in certain applications it is seen as an advantage for example automotive applications in cold climates benefit from the radiated heat as it melts potentially visually-obstructive snow and ice on warning lights and signs the heat is also used to melt the wax inside lava lamps dimmersedit some cfls may not be compatible with existing dimming circuits such as those using triacs although more dimmable cfls are expected to become available as the phase-outs continue124 mains voltage halogen bulbs provide a more efficient dimmable alternative to common incandescent bulbs and are readily available125 dimmable led lamps are available from several vendors although not all led lamps are compatible with dimmers and their color temperature may not lower as it does with incandescents see alsoedit electron stimulated luminescence phase-out of
