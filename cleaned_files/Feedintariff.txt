advanced renewable tariff2 or renewable energy payments3 is a policy mechanism designed to accelerate investment in renewable energy technologies it achieves this by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers typically based on the cost of generation of each technology14 rather than pay an equal amount for energy however generated technologies such as wind power and solar pv5 for instance are awarded a lower per-kwh price while technologies such as tidal power are offered a higher price reflecting costs that are higher at the moment in addition feed-in tariffs often include tariff degression a mechanism according to which the price or tariff ratchets down over time this is done in order to track425 and encourage technological cost reductions11006 the goal of feed-in tariffs is to offer cost-based compensation to renewable energy producers providing price certainty and long-term contracts that help finance renewable energy investments47 contents 1 description 1.1

guaranteed grid access long-term contracts cost-based purchase prices under a feed-in tariff eligible renewable electricity generators including homeowners business owners farmers and private investors are paid a cost-based price for the renewable electricity they supply to the grid this enables diverse technologies wind solar biogas etc to be developed and provides investors a reasonable return this principle was explained in germanys 2000 renewable energy sources act the compensation rates  have been determined by means of scientific studies subject to the provision that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation when managed efficiently to be operated cost-effectively based on the use of state-of-the-art technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment 2000 renewable energy sources act1016 as a result the tariff or rate may differ by technology location eg rooftop or ground-mounted for solar pv projects size residential or commercial scale and region9 the tariffs are typically designed to decline over time to track and encourage technological change4 fits typically offer a guaranteed purchase agreement for long 1525 year periods111 performance-based rates give incentives to producers to maximize the output and efficiency of their project12 as of 2010update feed-in tariff policies had been enacted in over 50 countries including algeria australia austria belgium brazil canada china cyprus the czech republic denmark estonia france germany greece hungary iran republic of ireland israel italy kenya the republic of korea lithuania luxembourg the netherlands portugal south africa spain switzerland tanzania thailand turkey and the united kingdom13 in early 2012 in spain the rajoy administration suspended the feed-in tariff for new projects14 in 2008 a detailed analysis by the european commission concluded that well-adapted feed-in tariff regimes are generally the most efficient and effective support schemes for promoting renewable electricity15 this conclusion was supported by other analyses including by the international energy agency1617 the european federation for renewable energy18 as well as by deutsche bank19 a feed-in tariff can differentiate on the basis of marginal cost this is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation finon under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on the lower end of the spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed-in tariff the more marginal producers face the higher tariff price this version of the policy has two objectives the first is to reduce the profitability of certain production cites many renewable sources are highly dependent on their location for example windmills are most profitable in windy locations and solar plants are best at sunny locations this means that generators tend to be concentrated at these most profitable sites the differentiated tariff seeks to make less naturally productive sites more profitable and so spread out the generators which many consider to be an undesirable good in the area finon imagine cutting down all the forests to build wind farms this would not be good for the environment this however leads to a less cost-effective production of renewable electricity as the most efficient sites are under-utilized the other goal of tariffs differentiated by marginal cost is to reduce the cost of the program finon under the uniform tariff all producers receive the same price which is at times in gross excess of the price needed to incentivize them to produce the additional revenue translates into profit thus the differentiated tariff attempts to give each producer what it requires to maintain production so that the optimal market quantity of renewable energy production can be reached finon20 overall and in light of incipient globalization feed-in tariffs are posing increasing problems from the point of view of trade as their implementation in one country can easily affect industries and policies of others thus requiring an ideally global coordination of treatment and imposition of such policy instrument which could be reached at the world trade organization21 compensationedit understanding feed-in tariff and power purchase agreement meter connections there are three methods of compensation feed-in tariff - compensation is above retail and as the percentage of adopters increases the fit is reduced to the retail rate net metering - allows producers to consume electricity from the grid eg when the wind stops credits typically roll over to future periods payments to the utility or the consumer depend on net consumption power purchase agreement - pays for the generation of electricity and is normally below the retail rate although in the case of solar can in some countries be higher because solar in many countries generates at times of peak demand historyedit united statesedit the first form of feed-in tariff under another name was implemented in the us in 1978 under president jimmy carter who signed the national energy act nea this law included five separate acts one of which was the public utility regulatory policies act purpa the purpose of the national energy act was to encourage energy conservation and develop new energy resources including renewables such as wind solar and geothermal power2223 within purpa was a provision that required utilities to purchase electricity generated from qualifying independent power producers at rates not to exceed their avoided cost23 avoided costs were designed to reflect the cost that a utility would incur to provide that same electrical generation different interpretations of purpa prevailed in the 1980s some utilities and state utility commissions interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs while others chose to define avoided costs as the avoided long-run marginal cost of generation23 the long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the years ahead this last approach was adopted by california in its standard offer contract no 4.24 another provision included in the purpa law was that utilities were prevented from owning more than 50 of projects to encourage new entrants23 to comply with purpa some states began offering standard offer contracts to producers californias public utility commission established a number of standard offer contracts including standard offer no4 so4 which made use of fixed prices based on the expected long-run cost of generation the long-run estimates of electricity costs were based on the belief widely held at the time that oil and gas prices would continue to increase25 this led to an escalating schedule of fixed purchase prices designed to reflect the long-run avoided costs of new electrical generation by 1992 private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 mw of wind capacity in california some of which is still in service today the adoption of purpa also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as florida and maine23 this notwithstanding purpa retains negative connotations in the us electricity industry when oil and gas prices plummeted in the late 1980s the standard offer contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison as a result purpa contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers25 another source of opposition to purpa stemmed from the fact that it was designed to encourage non-utility generation this was interpreted as a threat by many large utilities particularly monopolistic suppliers as a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation purpa has also been interpreted as an important step toward increasing competition23 europeedit in 1990 germany adopted its stromeinspeisungsgesetz streg or law on feeding electricity into the grid26 the streg required utilities to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy suppliers at a percentage of the prevailing retail price of electricity the percentage offered to solar and wind power was set at 90 of the residential electricity price while other technologies such as hydro power and biomass sources were offered percentages ranging from 6580 a project cap of 5 mw was included26 while germanys streg was insufficient to encourage costlier technologies such as photovoltaics it proved relatively effective at encouraging lower-cost technologies such as wind leading to the deployment of 4,400 mw of new wind capacity between 1991 and 1999 representing approximately one third of the global capacity at the time10 an additional challenge that streg addressed was the right to interconnect to the grid the streg guaranteed renewable electricity producers grid access10 similar percentage-based feed-in laws were adopted in spain27 as well as in denmark28 in the 1990s germanys renewable energy sources actedit main article german renewable energy sources act germanys feed-in law underwent a major restructuring in 2000 to become the renewable energy sources act 2000 german erneuerbare-energien-gesetz or eeg10 the long title is an act on granting priority to renewable energy sources in its new form the act proved to be a highly effective policy framework for accelerating the deployment of renewables29 important changes included29 purchase prices were based on generation cost this led to different prices for different technologies and for projects of varying sizes utilities were allowed to participate rates were designed to decline annually based on expected cost reductions known as tariff degression since it was very successful the german policy amended in 2004 2009 and 2012 was often used as the benchmark against which other feed-in tariff policies were considered other countries followed the german approach long-term contracts are typically offered in a non-discriminatory manner to all renewable energy producers because purchase prices are based on costs efficiently operated projects yield a reasonable rate of return1130 this principle was stated in the act the compensation rates  have been determined by means of scientific studies subject to the proviso that the rates identified should make it possible for an installation when managed efficiently to be operated cost-effectively based on the use of state-of-the-art technology and depending on the renewable energy sources naturally available in a given geographical environment renewable energy sources act 20001016 feed-in tariff policies typically target a 510 returncitation needed the success of photovoltaics in germany resulted in a drop in electricity prices of up to 40 during peak output times with savings between 520 million and 840 million for consumers3132 savings for consumers have meant conversely reductions in the profit margin of big electric power companies who reacted by lobbying the german government which reduced subsidies in 2012.32 the increase in the solar energy share in germany also had the effect of closing gas and coal-fired generation plants33 often all power produced is fed to the grid which makes the system work rather like a ppa according to the disambiguation above however there is no need for a purchase agreement with an utility but the feed-in tariff is state-administered so the term feed-in tariff german einsepeisetarif is usually used since around 2012 other types of contracts became more usual because ppas were supported and for small-scale solar projects direct use of power became more attractive when the feed-in tariff became lower than prices for power bought on 1 august 2014 a revised renewable energy sources act entered into force specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates feed-in tariffs for new capacity will gradually no longer be set by the government but will be determined by auction starting with ground-mounted solar plant34 this represented a major change in policy and will be further extended as of 2017 with tender processes for onshore and offshore wind effects on electricity ratesedit fits have had both increased and decreased effects on electricity prices35 increases have been attributed to the fact that renewable energy is typically more expensive than electricity generated from conventional sources36 increases of approximately four euros per month per household were recorded in germany37 however renewable energy can reduce spot market prices via the merit order effect the practice of using higher-cost fossil fuel facilities only when demand exceeds the capacity of lower cost facilities38 this has led to electricity price reductions in spain39 denmark28 and germany3840 grid parityedit grid parity occurs when the cost of an alternative technology for electricity production matches the existing average for the area parity can vary both in time ie during the course of the day and over the course of years and in space ie geographically the price of electricity from the grid varies widely from high-cost areas such as hawaii and california to lower-cost areas such as wyoming and idaho41 in areas with time-of-day pricing rates vary over the course of the day rising during high-demand hours eg 11 am8 pm and declining during low-demand hours in some areas wind power landfill gas and biomass generation are already lower-cost than grid electricity parity has already been achieved in areas that use feed-in tariffs for example generation cost from landfill gas systems in germany are currentlywhen lower than the average electricity spot market price42 in remote areas electricity from solar photovoltaics can be cheaper than building new distribution lines to connect to the transmission grid policy alternatives and complementsedit renewable portfolio standards rps and subsidies create protected markets for renewable energy rps require utilities to obtain a minimum percentage of their energy from renewable sources in some states utilities can purchase renewable energy certificates usa renewable energy certificate system eu renewable energy certificates registry aus to meet this requirement these certificates are issued to renewable energy producers based on the amount of energy they feed into the grid selling the certificates is another way for the renewable producer to supplement its revenues43 certificate prices fluctuate based on overall energy demand and competition among renewable producers if the amount of renewable energy produced exceeds the required amount certificate prices may crash as happened with carbon trading in europe this can damage the economic viability of the renewable producers44 quota systems favor large vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour they are also more difficult to design and implement than an fit45 by countryedit further information pv financial incentives

in australia feed-in tariffs were introduced in 2008 in south australia and queensland 2009 in the australian capital territory and victoria and 2010 in new south wales tasmania and western australia the northern territory offers only local feed-in tariff schemes a uniform federal scheme to supersede all state schemes was proposed by tasmanian greens senator christine milne but not enacted48 by mid-2011 feed-in tariff in nsw and act had been closed to new generators as the installed capacity cap had been reached in nsw both the feed-in tariff and the cap were cut due to the overly generous original settings49 the new conservative victorian government replaced the original feed-in tariff with a less generous transitional feed-in tariff of 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for any power generated excess to the generators usage pending the outcome of an inquiry by the victorian competition and efficiency commission this does not meet the normal definition and has been referred to as a fake feed-in tariff it is actually net metering with a payment for any kilowatt credit instead of the normal roll over50 canadaedit see also green energy act 2009 and windshare ontario introduced a

by new and renewable energy sources for households and private sector companies the energy tariff has been divided into five categories so that the price per kilowatt for households is egp 0.84 but for 200 kilowatts of usage the price rises to egp 0.911 the third category between 200 and 500 kilowatts will be charged egp 0.973 while the fourth ranging from 500 kilowatts to 20 megawatts will be charged egp 0.973 per kilowatt per hour the last category which stretches between 20-50mw will be charged egp 1.02 per kilowatt per hourinstitutions that use over 50mw will be charged under a different system the sale price for power generated from wind is calculated by the number of operating hours and from 2500 hours up through 3000 hours the rate is egp 0.828.the rate will be set at egp 0.684 for 30004000 hours the government will purchase the electricity generated by investors taking inflation into account while consumption will be paid in local currency and depreciation rates reviewed after two years the ministry of finance will provide concessional subsidised bank financing for households and institutions using less than 200 kw at a rate of 4 and 8 for 200-500kw the government is preparing a law that would allow for state-owned lands to be made available for new energy production projects under a usufruct system in exchange for 2 of the energy produced the electricity companies will be obligated to purchase and transport the energy the new tariff system also includes a reduction in customs on new and renewable energy production supplies by 2 while the proportion of bank financing has been set at 40-60 the government hopes for new and renewable energy to account for 20 egypts total energy mix by 2020

electricity feed-in act stromeinspeisungsgesetz in 2001 the european court of justice ecj ruled that the german arrangements did not constitute state aid63 the court concluded that statutory provisions of a member state which first require private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity and second distribute the financial burden resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private

those in nersas original proposal the tariffs differentiated by technology were to be paid for 20 years nersa said in its release that the tariffs were based on the cost of generation plus a reasonable profit the tariffs for wind energy and concentrating solar power were among the most attractive worldwide the tariff for wind energy 1.25 zarkwh 0.104kwh was greater than that offered in germany and more than proposed in ontario canada the tariff for concentrating solar 2.10 zarkwh was less than that in spain nersas revised program followed extensive public consultation stefan gsnger secretary general of the world wind energy association said south africa is the first african country to introduce a feed-in tariff for wind energy many small and big investors will now be able to contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country such decentralised investment will enable south africa to overcome its current energy crisis it will also help many south african communities to invest in wind farms and generate electricity new jobs and new income we are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after the first north american feed-in law has been proposed by the government of the canadian province of ontario91 however the tariff was abandoned before it began in favor of a competitive bidding process launched on 3 august 2011 under this bidding process the south african government planned to procure 3,750mw of renewable energy 1,850mw of onshore wind 1,450mw of solar pv 200mw of csp 75mw of small hydro 25mw of landfill gas 12.5mw of biogas 12.5mw of biomass and 100mw of small projects the bidding process comprised two steps qualification phase projects are assessed based on structure of the project legal land acquisition and use financial environmental consent technical economic development and bid guarantee evaluation phase compliant bids are then evaluated based on 1 price relative to a ceiling provided in bid documentation accounting for 70 of the decision and 2 economic development accounting for 30 of the decision the first round of bids was due on 4 november 2011 ppas were expected to be in place by june 2012 projects should be commissioned by june 2014 except csp projects expected by june 2015 spainedit spanish feed-in legislation was set by royal decree 15782008 real decreto 15782008 for photovoltaic installations and royal decree 6612007 for other renewable technologies injecting electricity to the public grid originally under the 6612007 photovoltaic tariffs were developed under a separate law due to its rapid growth the decree 15782008 categorized installations in two main groups with differentiated tariffs building integrated installations with 34ckwh in systems up to 20kw of nominal power and for systems above 20kw with a limit of nominal power of 2mw tariff of 31ckwh non integrated installations 32ckwh for systems up to 10mw of nominal power for other technologies decree 6612007 setd up energy source feed-in tariff cogeneration systems maximum fit of 13.29ckwh during lifetime of system solar thermoelectric 26.94 ckwh for the first 25 years wind systems up to 7.32 ckwh for the

combustion up to 12.57 ckwh for the first 15 years on 27 january 2012 the spanish government temporarily stopped accepting applications for projects beginning operation after january 2013 construction and operation of existing projects was not affected92 the countrys electrical system had a 24 billion deficit93 fit payments did not contribute significantly to that deficit94 in 2008 the fit was expected to result in 400 mw of solar being installed however it was so high that over 2600 mw was installed95 utilities in spain reported that they had no way to pass on cost increases to consumers by increasing rates and instead accrued deficits although this is under dispute switzerlandedit switzerland introduced the so-called cost-covering remuneration for feed-in to the electricity grid crf96 on 1 may 2008 crf applies to hydropower up to 10 megawatts photovoltaics wind energy geothermal energy biomass and waste material from biomass and will be applicable for 20 and 25 years depending on the technology the implementation is done through the national grid operator swissgrid97 while high by appearance crf has had little effect as the total amount of extra cost to the system was capped since about 2009 no more projects could be financed about 15000 projects awaited allocation of monies if all those projects were implemented switzerland could mothball all its nuclear power plants which currently supply 40 of its power in 2011 after fukushima some local power companies mostly owned by villages and cantonsprovinces selectively started offering their own tariff thereby creating a mini-boom as of march 2012 the kev-fit for solar pv had been lowered several times to chf 0.30-0.40kwh usd 0.33-0.44kwh depending on size but was higher than in germany and most of the rest of the world taiwanedit the feed-in tariff for renewable energy generation in taiwan is set by the bureau of energy it applies to most of the renewable energy sources namely solar wind hydraulic geothermal biomass waste etc98 thailandedit in 2006 the thai government enacted a tariff paid on top of utility avoided costs differentiated by technology type and generator size and guaranteed for

article feed-in tariffs in the united kingdom in october 2008 the united kingdom announced that britain would implement a scheme by 2010 in addition to its current renewable energy quota scheme rocs in july 2009 britains then-secretary of state for energy and climate change ed miliband presented details of the scheme which began in early april 2010.103 less than a year into the scheme in march 2011 the new coalition government announced that support for large-scale photovoltaic installations greater than 50kw would be cut104 this was in response to european speculators lining up to establish huge solar farms in the west country that would have absorbed disproportionate amounts of the fund105 on 9 june 2011 decc106 confirmed tariff cuts for solar pv systems above 50 kw after 1 august 2011.107 many108 were disappointed with deccs decision109 it was believed that the total subsidies for solar pv industry were unchanged but that tariffs for large systems would be cut to benefit smaller systems the fast track review was based on the long term plan to reach an annual installation of 1.9gw in 2020.110 in october 2011 decc announced dramatic cuts of around 55 to tariff rates with additional reductions for community or group schemes the cuts were to be effective from 12 december 2011 with a consultation exercise to end on 23 december 2011 this was successfully challenged in the high court by an application for judicial review jointly made by environmental pressure group friends of the earth foe and two solar companies - solarcentury and homesun the judgment made by mr justice mitting after a two-day court hearing was hailed as a major victory by green campaigners and the solar industry lawyers for the department of energy and climate change immediately moved to appeal the ruling the appeal was unanimously rejected by the supreme court allowing anyone who installed their systems before 3 march 2012 to receive the higher rate of 43.3 pkwh111 the 30.7

united statesedit further information renewable energy in the united states in april 2009 11 state legislatures were considering adopting a fit as a complement to their renewable electricity mandates53 californiaedit the california public utilities commission cpuc approved a feed-in tariff on 31 january 2008 effective immediately118 in 2010 marin energy authority launched the first community choice aggregate feed-in tariff program the program was updated in november 2012 and now offers 20-year fixed-price contracts with prices varying by energy source peak base-load intermittent and progress towards the current program cap of 10-mw municipal utility companies enacted feed in tariff pilot programs in palo alto and los angeles palo alto clean clean local energy accessible now is a program to purchase up to 4mw of electricity generated by solar electric systems located in cpaus service territory in 2012 the minimum project size was 100kw rates of purchase are between 12.360

commissioners approved a 10mw fit demonstration program120 as of 1 january 2010 state laws allowed homeowners to sell excess power to the utility previously the homeowner would get no credit for over-production over the course of the year in order to get the california solar initiative csi rebate the customer was not allowed to install a system that deliberately over-produces thereby encouraging efficiency measures to be installed after solar installation this over-production credit was not available to certain municipal utility customers namely los angeles water and power floridaedit in february 2009 city commissioners in gainesville florida approved the nations first solar feed-in tariff53 the program was capped at 4 mw per year as of 2011 gainesville had increased solar generated electricity from 328kw to 7,391kw approximately 1.2 of peak load energy 610mw.121 the program was suspended in 2014 after more than 18 mw of capacity had been installed122 hawaiiedit

maine utility and energy committee was to consider a new bill ld1085 an act to establish the renewable energy feed-in tariff127 new yorkedit the long island power authority lipa adopted a feed-in tariff on 16 july 2012 for systems from 50kw ac to 20 mw ac and was limited to 50 mw ac as customers cannot use their own electricity it is actually a 20-year fixed rate power purchase agreement and lipa retains the srecs the 2012 ny legislature failed to pass legislation which would have opened a new york market for srecs starting in 2013.128 payment is 22.5kwh,129 less than what lipa paid for peak generation at various times130 at an estimated avoided cost of 0.075kwh the program added about 0.44month to the average household electric bill131 oregonedit in june 2009 oregon established a pilot solar volumetric incentive rate and payment program under this incentive program systems are paid for the kilowatt-hours kwh generated over a 15-year period at a rate set at the time a system is enrolled in the program the oregon public utility commission puc established rates and rules in may 2010 this program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in oregon and administered by the utilities the puc planned to periodically re-evaluate rates program costs were recoverable in utility rates and utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive the pilot program installation cap was limited to an aggregate cap of 25 megawatts mw of solar photovoltaics pv with a maximum system size cap of 500 kilowatts kw the aggregate program cap was to be spread equally over four years with 6.25 mw of capacity being eligible to receive the incentive each year the aggregate cap was divided based on 2008 retail sales revenue pge had a cap of 14.9 mw pacific power 9.8 mw and idaho power 0.4 mw idaho powers program was limited to residential installations rates differed by system size and geographic zone small- and medium-scale systems participated in a program modeled after net metering larger-scale systems were competitivelly bid participating pv systems must be grid-connected metered and meet all applicable codes and regulations systems must be permanently installed systems sized 100kw or less could participate based on net metering generating capacity of 20 mw of the aggregate cap was reserved for the net metering portion with 12 mw available for residential and 8 mw available for small commercial systems these residential and small commercial systems were paid for the amount of electricity generated up to the amount of electricity consumed in essence customers were paid for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by onsite generation unlike typical feed-in tariffs customers can consume the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive or a volumetric incentive payment for the amount of electricity generated and consumed to remove a perverse incentive to increase electricity consumption to receive a greater payment the system had to be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption rates were determined by the puc based on annual system cost and annual energy output differentiated by geographic zones the cost estimates were based on installation data from energy trust of oregon the actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric incentive rate minus the retail rate the volumetric incentive rates were to be re-evaluated every six months the rates for the performance-based incentive program ranged from 0.25kwh to 0.411kwh.132 vermontedit vermont adopted feed-in tariffs on 27 may 2009 as part of the vermont energy act of 2009 generators must possess a capacity of no more than 2.2 mw and participation is limited to 50 mw in 2012 a limit that increased by 5 to 10 mwyear to a total of 127.5 mw in 2022.133 payments were 24kwh for solar which was increased to 27.1kwh in march 2012 and 11.8kwh for wind over 100kw and 25.3kwh for wind
