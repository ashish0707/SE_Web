centurybc coming into contact with the celtic tribes of gaul as well as iranian baltic and slavic tribes in central and eastern europe19 under augustus rome began to invade germania an area extending roughly from the rhine to the ural mountains in 9ad three roman legions led by varus were defeated by the cheruscan leader arminius by 100ad when tacitus wrote germania germanic tribes had settled along the rhine and the danube the limes germanicus occupying most of the area of modern germany austria baden wrttemberg southern bavaria southern hessen and the western rhineland however were roman

lands21 after the invasion of the huns in 375 and with the decline of rome from 395 germanic tribes moved further south-west simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now germany and displaced or absorbed smaller germanic tribes large areas known since the merovingian period as austrasia neustria and aquitaine were conquered by the franks who established the frankish kingdom and pushed further east to subjugate saxony and bavaria areas of what is today the eastern part of germany were inhabited by western slavic tribes of sorbs veleti and the obotritic confederation20 east francia and holy roman empire main articles east francia and holy roman empire in 800 the frankish king charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the carolingian empire which was later divided in 843 among his heirs22 following the break up of the frankish realm for 900 years the history of germany was intertwined with the history of the holy roman empire23 which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of charlemagnes original empire the territory initially known as east francia stretched from the rhine in the west to the elbe river in the east and from the north sea to the alps22 the ottonian rulers 9191024 consolidated several major duchies and the german king otto i was crowned holy roman emperor of these regions in 962 in 996 gregory v became the first german pope appointed by his cousin otto iii whom he shortly after crowned holy roman emperor the holy roman empire absorbed northern italy and burgundy under the reign of the salian emperors 10241125 although the emperors

influence further south and east into territories inhabited by slavs they encouraged german settlement in these areas called the eastern settlement movement ostsiedlung members of the hanseatic league which included mostly north german cities and towns prospered in the expansion of trade25 in the south the greater ravensburg trade corporation groe ravensburger handelsgesellschaft served a similar function the edict of the golden bull issued in 1356 by emperor charles iv provided the basic constitutional structure of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics26 population declined in the first half of the 14th century starting with the great famine in 1315 followed by the black death of 134850.27 despite the decline however german artists engineers and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as venice florence and genoa artistic and cultural centres throughout the german states produced such artists as the augsburg painters hans holbein and his son and albrecht drer johannes gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to europe a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses28 the holy roman empire in 1648 after the peace of westphalia which ended the thirty years war in 1517 the wittenberg monk martin luther publicised the ninety-five theses challenging the roman catholic church and initiating the protestant reformation in 1555 the peace of augsburg established lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to catholicism but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects a principle called cuius regio eius religio the agreement at augsburg failed to address other religious creed for example the reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler such as happened in electorate of cologne in 1583 from the cologne war until the end of the thirty years wars 16181648 religious conflict devastated german lands29 the latter reduced the overall population of the german states by about 30 per cent and in some places up to 80 per cent30 the peace of westphalia ended religious warfare among the german states29 german rulers were able to choose either roman catholicism lutheranism or the reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.31 in the 18th century the holy roman empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories32 the elaborate legal system initiated by a series of imperial reforms approximately 14501555 created the imperial estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical secular and hereditary states reflected in imperial diet the house of habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of charles vi in 1740

succession in the treaty of aix-la-chapelle maria theresas husband became holy roman emperor and she ruled the empire as empress consort from 1740 the dualism between the austrian habsburg monarchy and the kingdom of prussia dominated the german history in 1772 then again in 1793 and 1795 the two dominant german states of prussia and austria along with the russian empire agreed to the partitions of poland dividing among themselves the lands of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth as a result of the partitions millions of polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two german monarchies however the annexed territories though incorporated into the kingdom of prussia and the habsburg realm were not legally considered as a part of the holy roman empire3334 during the period of the french revolutionary wars along with the arrival of the napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the imperial diet most of the secular free imperial cities were annexed by dynastic territories the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed in 1806 the imperium was dissolved german states particularly the rhineland states fell under the influence of france until 1815 france russia prussia and the habsburgs competed for hegemony in the german states during the napoleonic wars35 german confederation and empire main articles german confederation german empire and german colonial empire following the fall of napoleon the congress of vienna convened in 1814 founded the german confederation deutscher bund a loose league of 39 sovereign states the appointment of the emperor of austria as the permanent president of the confederation reflected the congresss failure to accept prussias influence among the german states and acerbated the long-standing competition between the hohenzollern and habsburg interests disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements followed by new measures of repression by austrian statesman metternich the zollverein a tariff union furthered economic unity in the german states36 national and liberal ideals of the french revolution gained increasing support among many especially young germans the hambach festival in may 1832 was a main event in support of german unity freedom and democracy in the light of a series of revolutionary movements in europe which established a republic in

kingdom of prussia in blue in the grnderzeit period following the unification of germany bismarcks foreign policy as chancellor of germany under emperor william i secured germanys position as a great nation by forging alliances isolating france by diplomatic means and avoiding war under wilhelm ii germany like other european powers took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries most alliances in which germany had previously been involved were not renewed this resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of austria-hungary promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support subsequently the triple alliance of 1882 included italy completing a central european geographic alliance that illustrated german austrian and italian fears of incursions against them by france andor russia similarly britain france and russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against habsburg interference with russian interests in the balkans or german interference against france38 at the berlin conference in 1884 germany claimed several colonies including german east africa german south-west africa togoland and

responsibilities germanys new political leadership signed the treaty of versailles in 1919 in this treaty germany as part of the central powers accepted defeat by the allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of adolf hitler434445 after the defeat in the first world war germany lost around thirteen per cent of its european territory areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic polish french and danish populations which were lost following the greater poland uprising

restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the golden twenties an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life underneath it all though lay a current of animosity and frustration over the treaty of versailles widely perceived as a stab in the back which provided the basis of much of the anti-semitism rife in the next two decades48 the economic

devastating effects on the gdr where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support the east german authorities eased the border restrictions allowing east german citizens to travel to the west originally intended to help retain east germany as a state the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the wende reform process this culminated in the two plus four treaty a year
