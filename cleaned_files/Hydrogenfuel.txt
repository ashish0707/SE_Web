how and when to remove this template message hydrogen fuel is a zero-emission fuel when burned with oxygen if one considers water not as an emission or used in a contained cell also capable of reversing the reaction if needed it often uses electrochemical cells or combustion in internal engines to power vehicles and electric devices it is also used in the propulsion of spacecraft and might potentially be mass-produced and commercialized for passenger vehicles and aircraft hydrogen lies in the first group and first period in the periodic table ie it is the first element on the periodic table making it the lightest element since hydrogen gas is so light it rises in the atmosphere and is therefore rarely found in its pure form h21 in a flame of pure hydrogen gas burning in air the hydrogen h2 reacts with oxygen o2 to form water h2o and releases energy 2h2g o2g 2h2og if carried out in atmospheric air instead of pure oxygen as is usually the case hydrogen combustion may yield small amounts of nitrogen oxides along with the water vapor the energy released enables hydrogen to act as a fuel in an electrochemical cell that energy can be used with relatively high efficiency if it simply is used for heat the usual thermodynamics limits on the thermal efficiency apply since there is very little free hydrogen gas hydrogen is in practice only an energy carrier like electricity not an energy resource2 hydrogen gas must be produced and that production always requires more energy than can be retrieved from the gas as a fuel later on3 this is a limitation of the physical law of

productionedit main article hydrogen production because pure hydrogen does not occur naturally on earth in large quantities it takes a substantial amount of energy in its industrial production4 there are different ways to produce it such as electrolysis and steam-methane reforming process5 in electrolysis electricity is run through water to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms this method can use wind solar geothermal hydro fossil fuels biomass nuclear and many other energy sources2 obtaining hydrogen from this process is being studied as a viable way to produce it domestically at a low cost steam-methane reforming the current leading technology for producing hydrogen in large quantities6 extracts the hydrogen from methane however this reaction causes a side production of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which are greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming1 general chemistry textbooks and laboratory manuals have students prepare hydrogen by reacting many metals iron zinc and other metals but not copper silver platinum or gold with hydrochloric sulfuric phosphoric acid and other acids energyedit hydrogen is locked up in enormous quantities in water hydrocarbons and other organic matter one of the challenges of using hydrogen as a fuel comes from being able to efficiently extract hydrogen from these compounds currently steam reforming or combining high-temperature steam with natural gas accounts for the majority of the hydrogen produced7 hydrogen can also be produced from water through electrolysis but this method is much more energy intensive once extracted hydrogen is an energy carrier ie a store for energy first generated by other means the energy can be delivered to fuel cells and generate electricity and heat or burned to run a combustion engine8 in each case hydrogen is combined with oxygen to form water the heat in a hydrogen flame is a radiant emission from the newly formed water molecules the water molecules are in an excited state on initial formation and then transition to a ground state the transition unleashing thermal radiation when burning in air the temperature is roughly 2000c historically carbon has been the most practical carrier of energy as more energy is packed in fossil fuels than pure liquid hydrogen of the same volume the carbon atoms have classic storage capabilities9 and releases even more energy when burned with hydrogen however burning carbon base fuel and releasing its exhaust contributes to global warming due to the greenhouse effect of carbon gases pure hydrogen is the smallest element and some of it will inevitably escape from any known container or pipe in micro amounts yet simple ventilation could prevent such leakage from ever reaching the volatile 4 hydrogen-air mixture so long as the product is in a gaseous or liquid state pipes are a classic and very efficient form of transportation pure hydrogen though causes metal to become brittle suggesting metal pipes may not be ideal for hydrogen transport usesedit main article hydrogen economy hydrogen fuel can provide motive power for liquid-propellant rockets cars boats and airplanes portable fuel cell applications or stationary fuel cell applications which can power an electric motor10 the problems of using hydrogen fuel in cars arise from the fact that hydrogen is difficult to store in either a high pressure tank or a cryogenic tank11 see alsoedit hcng hydrogen safety hydrogen storage hydrogen compressor oxyhydrogen flame photocatalytic water splitting to isolate hydrogen hydrogen technologies hydrogen vehicle
