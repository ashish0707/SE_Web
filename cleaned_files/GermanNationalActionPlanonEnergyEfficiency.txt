the german national action plan on energy efficiency nape german nationale aktionsplan energieeffizienz is the national energy efficiency action plan neeap for germany1 the plan was commissioned under eu energy efficiency directive 201227eu of the european union and released on 3 december 2014.2 under the plan the german government offers an average increase of 2.1year in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020.a17 the exact reduction in primary energy use is therefore dependent on the rate of economic growth the nape is part of the climate action programme2020 also approved on 3december 2014.4 contents 1 targets 2 policy and monitoring 3 see also 4 notes 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links targetsedit the german government target under the national action plan on energy efficiency is specified in terms of energy productivity relative to gross domestic product gdp under the plan the german government offers an average annual increase of 2.1 in macroeconomic energy productivity from 2008 to 2020.17 assuming an annual increase in gdp of 1.1 this represents a reduction in the energy-related share of primary energy consumption in million tonnes crude oil equivalent from 314.3mtoe 13.2ej in 2008 to 276.6mtoe 11.6ej in 2020 and corresponds to a reduction in final energy consumption from 220.7mtoe 9.24ej in 2008 to 194.3mtoe 8.13ej in 2020 these projections are covered by a caveat on economic and physical influences beyond the control of the government17 this macroeconomic target is concurrent with other official energy efficiency and consumption targets not included in the national action plan on energy efficiency in particular that of reducing primary energy consumption from 2008 levels by 20 in 2020 and by 50 in 2050.34 policy and monitoringedit the areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings energy conservation for companies consumer energy efficiency and transport energy efficiency the policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures the central short-term measures of nape include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency the raising of funding for building renovation the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry german industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution56 the governments fourth energy transition monitoring report published in 2015 briefly reviews the national action plan on energy efficiency3813 government progress on its energy efficiency targets under nape and elsewhere and on the energiewende more generally is subject to external review the 2015 review found energy efficiency developments in electricity and space heating were roughly on track although developments in transport were not but because the various instruments introduced specifically under nape were still in planning testing or early introduction the review panel was unable to analyse their effectiveness these instruments will be covered in future reviews7811 the 2016 annual report on nape submitted to the eu on 28 april 2016 presented the major legislative and non-legislative energy efficiency measures adopted in the previous year these include the energy efficiency network initiative aimed at companies new obligations on non-smes to carry out regular energy audits increased funding for energy efficient commercial renovation and new-build and a new energy efficiency strategy for buildings esg that may result in an almost climate-neutral building stock83 in addition the government is in the process of developing a scheme to promote heating optimization an energy efficiency program for waste heat programs to increase the energy efficiency in municipalities and measures to improve the use of energy in rail transport the report also noted that final energy consumption in the transport sector rose by 3.9pj between 2013 and 2014 as a result of the increase in passenger-kilometres by around 2.0 and tonne-kilometres by around 1.3 despite improvements in the final energy consumption per kilometre8 see alsoedit
