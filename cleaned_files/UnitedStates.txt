contacts the native population declined for various reasons primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among native americans

before disembarking established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies6869 most settlers in every colony were small farmers but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements cash crops included tobacco rice and wheat extraction industries grew up in furs fishing and lumber manufacturers produced rum and ships and by the late colonial period americans were producing one-seventh of the worlds iron supply70 cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotch-irish and other groups as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west71 slave cultivation of cash crops began with the spanish in the 1500s and was adopted by the english but life expectancy was much higher in north america because of less disease and better food and treatment leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves727374 colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice7576 but by the turn of the 18th century african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor especially in southern regions77 with the british colonization of georgia in 1732 the 13 colonies
