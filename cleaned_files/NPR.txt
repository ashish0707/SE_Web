from federal state and local government funding 10 of their revenue from cpb grants and 14 of their revenue from universities2034 while npr does not receive any direct federal funding it does receive a small number of competitive grants from cpb and federal agencies like the department of education and the department of commerce this funding amounts to approximately 2 of nprs overall revenues20 during the 1970s and early 1980s the majority of npr funding came from the federal government steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes according to cpb in 2009 11.3 of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources principally through cpb35 in 2012 10.9 of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources36 in 2011 npr announced the roll-out of their own online advertising network which allows member stations to run

commercials are governed by specific fcc restrictions in addition to truth in advertising laws they cannot advocate a product or promote the goods and services of for-profit entities41 these restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not nprs other digital platforms when questioned on the subject of how corporate underwriting revenues and foundation grants were holding up during the recession in a speech broadcast on c-span before the national press club on march 2 2009 then president and ceo vivian schiller stated underwriting is down its down for everybody this is the area that is most down for us in sponsorship underwriting advertising call it whatever you want just like it is for all of media42 hosts of the npr program planet money stated the audience is indeed a product

for younger audiences controversiesedit main article npr controversies over the course of nprs history controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics allegations of ideological biasedit npr has been accused of displaying both liberal bias as alleged in work such as a ucla and university of missouri study of morning edition and conservative bias including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative think-tanks58 npr has also been accused of bias related to specific topics including support of the 2003 invasion of iraq and coverage of israel the npr ombudsman has described how nprs coverage of the israel-palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides59 university of texas journalism professor and author robert jensen has criticized npr as taking a pro-war stance during coverage of iraq war protests60 in 2002 and 2003 surveys and follow-up focus groups conducted by the tarrance group and lake snell perry associates have indicated that the majority of the us adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased the plurality of americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other while approximately two-in-ten detect a liberal bias and approximately one-in-ten detect a conservative bias61 euphemismsedit in a controversial act npr banned in 2009 the use of the word torture in the context of the bush administrations use of enhanced interrogation techniques62 nprs ombudswoman alicia shepards defense of the policy was that calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides63 but berkeley professor of linguistics geoffrey nunberg pointed out that virtually all media around the world other than what he called the spineless us media call these techniques torture6465 in an article which criticized npr and other us media for their use of euphemisms for torture glenn greenwald discussed what he called the enabling corruption of american journalism this active media complicity in concealing that our government created a systematic torture regime by refusing ever to say so is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long the steadfast ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the bush administration did as torture even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths the use of that term by a leading bush official to describe what was done at guantanamo and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word torture to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries --reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks66 live from death row commentariesedit in 1994 npr arranged to air on all things considered a series of three-minute commentaries by mumia
