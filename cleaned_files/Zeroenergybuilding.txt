zero-energy test building in tallinn estonia tallinn university of technology a zero-energy building also known as a zero net energy zne building net-zero energy building nzeb or net zero building is a building with zero net energy consumption meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site12 or in other definitions by renewable energy sources elsewhere3 these buildings consequently contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than similar non-zne buildings they do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount most zero net energy buildings get half or more of their energy from the grid and return the same amount at other times buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called energy-plus buildings and buildings that consume slightly more energy than they produce are called near-zero energy buildings or ultra-low energy houses traditional buildings consume 40 of the total fossil fuel energy in the us and european union and are significant contributors of greenhouse gases45 the zero net energy consumption principle is viewed as a means to reduce carbon emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and although zero-energy buildings remain uncommon even in developed countries they are gaining importance and popularity most zero-energy buildings use the electrical grid for energy storage but some are independent of the grid energy is usually harvested on-site through energy producing technologies like solar and wind while reducing the overall use of energy with highly efficient hvac and lighting technologies the zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil fuels increase the development of modern zero-energy buildings became possible not only through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and techniques but it has also been significantly improved by academic research which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs zero-energy buildings can be part of a smart grid some advantages of these buildings are as follows integration of renewable energy resources integration of plug-in electric vehicles implementation of zero-energy concepts the net zero concept is applicable to a wide range of resources due to the many options for producing and conserving resources in buildings eg energy water waste energy is the first resource to be targeted because it is highly managed expected to continually become more efficient and the ability to distribute and allocate it will improve disaster resiliency6 contents 1

net energy there are several definitions of what the term means in practice with a particular difference in usage between north america and europe7 zero net site energy use in this type of zne the amount of energy provided by on-site renewable energy sources is equal to the amount of energy used by the building in the united states zero net energy building generally refers to this type of building zero net source energy use this zne generates the same amount of energy as is used including the energy used to transport the energy to the building this type accounts for losses during electricity transmission these znes must generate more electricity than zero net site energy buildings net zero energy emissions outside the united states and canada a zeb is generally defined as one with zero net energy emissions also known as a zero carbon building or zero emissions building under this definition the carbon emissions generated from on-site or off-site fossil fuel use are balanced by the amount of on-site renewable energy production other definitions include not only the carbon emissions generated by the building in use but also those generated in the construction of the building and the embodied energy of the structure others debate whether the carbon emissions of commuting to and from the building should also be included in the calculationrecent work in new zealand has initiated an approach to include building user transport energy within zero energy building frameworks8 net zero cost in this type of building the cost of purchasing energy is balanced by income from sales of electricity to the grid of electricity generated on-site such a status depends on how a utility credits net electricity generation and the utility rate structure the building uses net off-site zero energy use a building may be considered a zeb if 100 of the energy it purchases comes from renewable energy sources even if the energy is generated off the site off-the-grid off-the-grid buildings are stand-alone zebs that are not connected to an off-site energy utility facility they require distributed renewable energy generation and energy storage capability for when the sun is not shining wind is not blowing etc an energy autarkic house is a building concept where the balance of the own energy consumption and production can be made on an hourly or even smaller basis energy autarkic houses can be taken off-the-grid net zero-energy building based on scientific analysis within the joint research program towards net zero energy solar buildings9 a methodological framework was set up which allows different definitions in accordance with countrys political targets specific climate conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions the overall conceptual understanding of a net zeb is an energy efficient grid connected building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand see figure 1 figure 1 the net zeb balance concept balance of weighted energy import respectively energy demand x-axis and energy export feed-in credits respectively on-site generation y-axis  the wording net emphasizes the energy exchange between the building and the energy infrastructure by the building-grid interaction the net zebs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure this connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings the similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions 1 reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use 2 generate energy from renewable sources however the net zebs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers10 evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands11 within this balance procedure several aspects and explicit choices have to be determined the building system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered eg in buildings footprint on-site or even off-site see12 respectively how many buildings are included in the balance single building cluster of buildings and a balance boundary which determines the included energy uses eg heating cooling ventilation hot water lighting appliances it central services electric vehicles and embodied energy etc it should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized eg by transportation or conversion effort availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future etc and therefore create a hierarchy it may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options the weighting system converts the physical units of different energy carriers into a uniform metric sitefinal energy sourceprimary energy renewable parts included or not energy cost equivalent carbon emissions and even energy or environmental credits and allows their comparison and compensation among each other in one single balance eg exported pv electricity can compensate imported biomass politically influenced and therefore possibly asymmetrically or time dependent conversionweighting factors can affect the relative value of energy carriers and can influence the required energy generation capacity the balancing period is often assumed to be one year suitable to cover all operation energy uses a shorter period monthly or seasonal could also be considered as well as a balance over the entire life cycle including embodied energy which could also be annualized and counted in addition to operational energy uses the energy balance can be done in two balance types 1 balance of deliveredimported and exported energy monitoring phase as self-consumption of energy generated on-site can be included 2 balance between weighted energy demand and weighted energy generation for design phase as normally end users temporal consumption patterns -eg for lighting appliances etc- are lacking alternatively a balance based on monthly net values in which only residuals per month are summed up to an annual balance is imaginable this can be seen either as a loadgeneration balance or as a special case of importexport balance where a virtual monthly self-consumption is assumed see figure 2 figure 2 the net zeb balance concept graphical representation of the different types of balance importexport balance between weighted exported and delivered energy loadgeneration balance between weighted generation and load and monthly net balance between weighted monthly net values of generation and load and compare13 beside the energy balance net zebs can be characterized by their ability to match the buildings load by its energy generation load matching or to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grid infrastructure grind interaction both can be expressed by suitable indicators which are intended as assessment tools only the information is based on the publications1314 and15 in which deeper information could be found design and constructionedit the most cost-effective steps toward a reduction in a buildings energy consumption usually occur during the design process16 to achieve efficient energy use zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested passive solar or artificial conditioning principles that work with the on-site assets sunlight and solar heat prevailing breezes and the cool of the earth below a building can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means zebs are normally optimized to use passive solar heat gain and shading combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day and in most climates are superinsulated17 all the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available off-the-shelf today sophisticated 3-d building energy simulation tools are available to model how a building will perform with a range of design variables such as building orientation relative to the daily and seasonal position of the sun window and door type and placement overhang depth insulation type and values of the building elements air tightness weatherization the efficiency of heating cooling lighting and other equipment as well as local climate these simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building cost benefit analysis or even more appropriate life cycle assessment zero-energy buildings are built with significant energy-saving features the heating and cooling loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment added insulation high-efficiency windows natural ventilation and other techniques these features vary depending on climate zones in which the construction occurs water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures heat recovery units on waste water and by using solar water heating and high-efficiency water heating equipment in addition daylighting with skylights or solartubes can provide 100 of daytime illumination within the home nighttime illumination is typically done with fluorescent and led lighting that use 13 or less power than incandescent lights without adding unwanted heat and miscellaneous electric loads can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or standby power other techniques to reach net zero dependent on climate are earth sheltered building principles superinsulation walls using straw-bale construction vitruvianbuilt pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading zero-energy buildings are often designed to make dual use of energy including white goods for example using refrigerator exhaust to heat domestic water ventilation air and shower drain heat exchangers office machines and computer servers and body heat to heat the building these buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings may exhaust outside they may use heat recovery ventilation hot water heat recycling combined heat and power and absorption chiller unitscitation needed energy harvestedit zebs harvest available energy to meet their electricity and heating or cooling needs in the case of individual houses various microgeneration technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building using solar cells or wind turbines for electricity and biofuels or solar thermal collectors linked to a seasonal thermal energy storage stes for space heating an stes can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground to cope with fluctuations in demand zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the electricity grid export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced7 other buildings may be fully autonomous energy harvesting is most often more effective in cost and resource utilization when done on a local but combined scale for example a group of houses cohousing local district village etc rather than an individual basis an energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of electrical transmission and electricity distribution losses these losses amount to about 7.27.4 of the energy transferred18 energy harvesting in commercial and industrial applications should benefit from the topography of each location the production of goods under net zero fossil energy consumption requires locations of geothermal microhydro solar and wind resources to sustain the concept19 zero-energy neighborhoods such as the bedzed development in the united kingdom and those that are spreading rapidly in california and china may use distributed generation schemes this may in some cases include district heating community chilled water shared wind turbines etc there are current plans to use zeb technologies to build entire off-the-grid or net zero energy use cities the energy harvest versus energy conservation debateedit one of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between energy conservation and the distributed point-of-use harvesting of renewable energy solar energy wind energy and thermal energy most zero energy homes use a combination of these strategiescitation needed as a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems wind turbines etc there are those who suggest that a zeb is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy harvesting technologies entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations where photovoltaic pv subsidies are significant20 but many so called zero energy homes still have utility bills this type of energy harvesting without added energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current price of electricity generated with photovoltaic equipment depending on the local price of power company electricity21 and may also requires greater embodied energy and greater resources so be thus the less ecological approachcitation needed since the 1980s passive solar building design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70 to 90 in many locations without active energy harvesting for new builds and with expert design this can be accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design22 such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building21 a few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kwh production us dollar equivalent may only reduce external energy requirements by 15 to 30 a 100,000btu 110mj high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kw of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation passive cooling and superior system engineering techniques can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70 to 90 photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower occupant behavioredit the energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants the acceptance of what is considered comfortable varies widely studies of identical homes in the united states have shown dramatic differences in energy use with some homes using more than twice the energy of others23 occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming thermostats varying levels of illumination and hot water and the amount of miscellaneous electric devices or plug loads used24 utility concernsedit utility companies are typically legally responsible for maintaining the electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities neighborhoods and individual buildings utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel and in some cases own electrical infrastructure on private land as well utilities have expressed concern that the use of net metering for zne projects threatens the utilities base revenue which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain net metering laws may saddle non-zne homes with higher utility costs as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while zne home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve zne status this creates potential equity issues as currently the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households a possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid which would force zne home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use additional concerns exist that local distribution as well as larger transmission grids have not been designed to convey electricity in two directions which may be necessary as higher levels of distributed energy generation come on line overcoming this barrier could require extensive upgrades to the electrical grid however this is not believed to be a major problem until renewable generation reaches much higher levels of penetration than currently realized25 development effortsedit wide acceptance of zero-energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations the development of recognized standards or significant increases in the cost of conventional energycitation needed the google photovoltaic campus and the microsoft 480-kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on us federal and especially california subsidies and financial incentives california is now providing us32 billion in subsidies26 for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings due to californias serious electricity shortage frequent power outages and air pollution problems the details of other american states renewable energy subsidies up to us500 per watt can be found in the database of state incentives for renewables and efficiency27 the florida solar energy center has a slide presentation on recent progress in this area28 the world business council for sustainable development29 has launched a major initiative to support the development of zeb led by the ceo of united technologies and the chairman of lafarge the organization has both the support of large global companies and the expertise to mobilize the corporate world and governmental support to make zeb a reality their first report a survey of key players in real estate and construction indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by 300 percent survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are 19 percent of the worldwide total in contrast to the actual value of roughly 40 percent30 influential zero-energy and low-energy buildingsedit those who commissioned construction of passive houses and zero-energy homes over the last three decades were essential to iterative incremental cutting-edge technology innovations much has been learned from many significant successes and a few expensive failures31 the zero-energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other low-energy building designs among these the canadian r-2000 and the german passive house standards have been internationally influential collaborative government demonstration projects such as the superinsulated saskatchewan house and the international energy agencys task 13 have also played their part net zero energy building definitionedit the us national renewable energy lab nrel published a groundbreaking report titled net-zero energy buildings a classification system based on renewable energy supply options3 this is the first report to lay out a full spectrum classification system for net zerorenewable energy buildings that includes the full spectrum of clean energy sources both on site and off site this classification system identifies the following 4 main categories of net zero energy buildingssitescampuses nzeba -- a footprint renewables net zero energy building nzebb -- a site renewables net zero energy building nzebc -- an imported renewables net zero energy building nzebd -- an off-site purchased renewables net zero energy building applying this us government net zero classification system means that every building can become net zero with the right combination of the key net zero technologies - pv solar ghp geothermal heating and cooling thermal batteries ee

net zero effect on us total energy use32 showing a possible 39 us total fossil fuel use reduction by changing us residential and commercial buildings to net zero 37 savings if we still use nat gas for cooking at the same level net zero carbon conversion exampleedit many well known universities have professed to want to completely convert their energy systems off of fossil fuels the very idea that one could convert a whole campus off of fossil fuels has to date only been theoretical capitalizing on the continuing developments in both photovoltaics and geothermal heat pump technologies and in the advancing electric battery field complete conversion to a carbon free energy solution is now possible an example of this is in the net zero foundations proposal at mit to take that campus completely off fossil fuel use33 this proposal shows the coming application of net zero energy buildings technologies at the district energy scale advantages and disadvantagesedit advantagesedit isolation for building owners from future energy price increases increased comfort due to more-uniform interior temperatures this can be demonstrated with comparative isotherm maps reduced requirement for energy austerity reduced total cost of ownership due to improved energy efficiency reduced total net monthly cost of living reduced risk of loss from grid blackouts improved reliability photovoltaic systems have 25-year warranties and seldom fail during weather problems the 1982 photovoltaic systems on the walt disney world epcot energy pavilion are still working fine today after going through three recent hurricanes extra cost is minimized for new construction compared to an afterthought retrofit higher resale value as potential owners demand more zebs than available supply the value of a zeb building relative to similar conventional building should increase every time energy costs increase future legislative restrictions and carbon emission taxespenalties may force expensive retrofits to inefficient buildings disadvantagesedit initial costs can be higher effort required to understand apply and qualify for zeb subsidies if they exist very few designers or builders have the necessary skills or experience to build zebs22 possible declines in future utility company renewable energy costs may lessen the value of capital invested in energy efficiency new photovoltaic solar cells equipment technology price has been falling at roughly 17 per year it will lessen the value of capital invested in a solar electric generating system current subsidies will be phased out as photovoltaic mass production lowers future price challenge to recover higher initial costs on resale of building but new energy rating systems are being introduced gradually34 while the individual house may use an average of net zero energy over a year it may demand energy at the time when peak demand for the grid occurs in such a case the capacity of the grid must still provide electricity to all loads therefore a zeb may not reduce the required power plant capacity without an optimised thermal envelope the embodied energy heating and cooling energy and resource usage is higher than needed zeb by definition do not mandate a minimum heating and cooling performance level thus allowing oversized renewable energy systems to fill the energy gap solar energy capture using the house envelope only works in locations unobstructed from the sun the solar energy capture cannot be optimized in north for northern hemisphere or south for southern hemisphere facing shade or wooded surroundings zero energy building versus green buildingedit the goal of green building and sustainable architecture is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a buildings negative impact on the environment35 zero energy buildings achieve one key green-building goal of completely or very significantly reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for the life of the building zero energy buildings may or may not be considered green in all areas such as reducing waste using recycled building materials etc however zero energy or net-zero buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other green buildings that require imported energy andor fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants because of the design challenges and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy solar wind geothermal etc designers must apply holistic design principles and take advantage of the free naturally occurring assets available such as passive solar orientation natural ventilation daylighting thermal mass and night time cooling certificationedit many green building certification programs do not require a building to have net zero energy use only to reduce energy use a few percentage points below the minimum required by law green globes involves check lists that are measurement tools not design tools inexperienced designers or architects may cherry-pick points to meet a target certification level even though those points may not be the best design choices for a specific building or climatecitation needed in november 2011 the international living future institute developed the net zero energy building certification designed as part of the living building challenge net zero energy building certification is simple cost effective and critical for integrity and transparency worldwideedit international

homes to be built and sold to the public beginning in 2009 thomas siebel made many presentations about his energy free home challenge72 the siebel foundation report stated that the energy free home challenge was launching in late 2009.73 the lawrence berkeley national laboratory at the university of california berkeley participated in writing the feasibility of achieving zero-net-energy zero-net-cost homes74 for the 20-million energy free home challenge if implemented the energy free home challenge would have provided increased incentives for improved technology and consumer education about zero energy buildings coming in at the same cost as conventional housing us department of energy solar decathlonedit the us department of energy solar decathlon is an international competition that challenges collegiate teams to design build and operate the most attractive effective and energy-efficient solar-powered house achieving zero net energy balance is a major focus of the competition listedit arizona zero energy house developed by the nahb research center and john wesley miller companies tucson california the state of california has proposed that all new low- and mid-rise residential buildings and all new commercial buildings be designed and constructed to zne standards beginning in 2020 and 2030 respectively7576 the requirements if implemented will be promulgated via the california building code which is updated on a three-year cycle and which currently mandates some of the highest energy efficiency standards in the united states california is anticipated to further increase efficiency requirements by 2020 thus avoiding the trends discussed above of building standard housing and achieving zne by adding large amounts of renewables the california energy commission is required to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove that new regulations create a net benefit for residents of the state there has yet to be publicly released analysis of the impact that zne standards may have to construction real estate and energy prices in the state debate exists as to if the states stringent efficiency requirements are directly responsible for the apparent flatlining of residential electricity use in the state since 1975.77 this debate is relevant to zne codes as it remains to be seen via models or in practice what overall effect the proliferation of zne buildings will have on overall electricity use in the state and at what cost west village located on the university of california campus in davis california was the largest zne-planned community in north america at the time of its opening in 2014.78 the development contains student housing for approximately 1,980 uc davis students as well as leasable office space and community amenities including a community center pool gym restaurant and convenience store office spaces in the development are currently leased by energy and transportation-related university programs the project was a public-private partnership between the university and west village community partnership llc led by carmel partners of san francisco a private developer who entered into a 60-year ground lease with the university and was responsible for the design construction and implementation of the 300 million project which is intended to be market-rate housing for davis this is unique as the developer designed the project to achieve zne at no added cost to themselves or to the residents designed and modeled to achieve zne the project uses a mixture of passive elements roof overhangs well-insulated walls radiant heat barriers ducts in insulated spaces etc as well as active approaches occupancy sensors on lights high-efficiency appliances and lighting etc designed to out-perform californias 2008 title 24 energy codes by 50 the project produced 87 of the energy it consumed during its first year in operation78 the shortcoming in zne status is attributed to several factors including improperly functioning heat pump water heaters which have since been fixed occupant behavior is significantly different than anticipated with the all-student population using more energy on a per-capita basis than typical inhabitants of single-family homes in the area one of the primary factors driving increased energy use appears to be the increased miscellaneous electrical loads mel or plug loads in the form of mini-refrigerators lights computers gaming consoles televisions and other electronic equipment the university continues to work with the developer to identify strategies for achieving zne status these approaches include incentivizing occupant behavior and increasing the sites renewable energy capacity which is a 4 mw photovoltaic array per the original design the west village site is also home to the honda smart home us79 a beyond-zne single-family home that incorporates cutting-edge technologies in energy management lighting construction and water efficiency the ideas z2 design facility80 is a net zero energy zero carbon retrofit project occupied since 2007 it uses less than one fourth the energy of a typical us office81 by applying strategies
