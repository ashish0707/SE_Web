hemisphere and the sixth-tallest in the world the supertall structure has the same name as the north tower of the original world trade center which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre 6.5ha world trade center site on the site of the original 6 world trade center the building is bounded by west street to the west vesey street to the north fulton street to the south and washington street to the east the buildings architect was david childs whose firm skidmore owings merrill som also designed the

structure in new york city on april 30 2012 when it surpassed the height of the empire state building the towers steel structure was topped out on august 30 2012 on may 10 2013 the final component of the skyscrapers spire was installed making the building including its spire reach a total height of 1,776 feet 541m its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the united states declaration of independence was signed the building opened on november 3 2014 on march 30 2009 the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of one world trade center rather than its colloquial name of freedom tower the building is 104 standard floors high but the tower has only 94 actual stories the new world trade center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings built along greenwich street as well as the national september 11 memorial museum located just south of one world trade center

construction of the world trade center of which the twin towers one and two world trade center were the centerpieces was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by david rockefeller the project was intended to help revitalize lower manhattan13 the project was planned by the port authority of new york and new jersey which hired architect minoru yamasaki yamasaki came up with the idea of building twin towers after extensive negotiations the new jersey and new york state governments which supervise the port authority consented to the construction of the world trade center at the radio row site located in the lower-west area of manhattan14 to satisfy the new jersey government the port authority agreed to buy the bankrupt hudson manhattan railroad renamed to port authority trans-hudson which transported commuters from new jersey to lower manhattan15 the towers were designed as framed tube structures giving tenants open floor plans unobstructed by columns or walls1617 this design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns providing much of the structures strength with the gravity load shared with the core columns the elevator system which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller the design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation1819 construction of the north tower one world trade center began in august 1966 extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process the first tenants moved into the north tower in december 1970.2021 in the 1970s four other low-level buildings were built as part of the world trade center complex2223 a seventh building was built in the mid-1980s2425 specifications and operations after seven world trade center was built in the 1980s the world trade center complex had a total of seven buildings however the most notable ones were the main twin towers built in the 1970sone world trade center was the north tower and two world trade center was the south tower26 each tower was over 1,350 feet 410m high and occupied about 1 acre 0.40ha of the total 16 acres 6.5ha of the sites land during a press conference in 1973 yamasaki was asked why two 110-story buildings why not one 220-story building his response was i didnt want to lose the human scale27 when completed in 1972 one world trade center became the tallest building in the world for two years surpassing the empire state building which had held the record for 40 years the north tower was 1,368 feet 417m tall and in 1978 a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof by itself the antenna was 360 feet 110m tall with the 360-foot 110m-tall antenna the highest point of the north tower reached 1,728ft 527m.28 the tower held its record for a brief period of time chicagos sears tower finished in may 1973 was 1,450 feet 440m at the rooftop29 at 110 floors the world trade center towers had more floors than any other building at that time28 this number was not surpassed until the construction of the burj khalifa 163 floors which opened in 2010.3031 of the 110 stories eight were set aside as mechanical floors floors 78 4142 7576 and 108109 which were four two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals all the remaining floors were open for tenants each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet 3,700m2 of available space32 the north and south tower had 3,800,000 square feet 350,000m2 of total office space32 the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of 13,400,000 square feet 1,240,000m2 of office space222333 lobby of tower 1 looking south along the east side of the building august 19 2000 the complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele during the early years various governmental organizations became key tenants of the world trade center such as the state of new york in the 1980s the citys perilous financial condition eased after which an increasing number of private companiesmostly financial firms related to wall streetbecame tenants during the 1990s approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex including financial companies such as morgan stanley aon corporation and salomon brothers the basement concourse of the world trade center included the mall at the world trade center34 and a path station35 the north tower became the main corporate headquarters of cantor fitzgerald36 and it also became the headquarters of the port authority of new york and new jersey37 the towers electrical service was supplied by consolidated edison coned at 13,800volts the electricity passed through the world trade center primary distribution center pdc and was then sent up the buildings core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors the substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480277volts and the voltage was then further lowered to 208120volts for general power and lighting services the complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of five world trade center3839 the 110th floor of one world trade center the north tower housed radio and television transmission equipment the roof of the north tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas including the 360 feet 110m center antenna mast rebuilt by dielectric inc to support dtv in 1999.40 the center mast contained the television signals for almost all nyc television broadcasters wcbs-tv2 wnbc-tv4 wnyw5 wabc-tv7 wwor-tv9 secaucus wpix11 wnet13 newark wpxn-tv31 and wnju47 linden40 it also had four nyc fm broadcasters wpat-fm931 wnyc939 wkcr899 and wktu103540 access to the roof was controlled by the wtc operations control center occ located in the b1 level of the south tower40 after the september 11 attacks of 2001 the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the empire state building41 on a typical weekday a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the north and south towers42 with another 200,000 passing through as visitors43 the complex was so large that it had its own zip code 10048.44 the windows on the world restaurant located on top of the north tower reported revenues of 37 million in 2000 making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the united states45 the twin towers became known worldwide appearing in movies television shows postcards and other merchandise the towers came to be seen as a new york city icon much like the empire state building the chrysler building and the statue of liberty46 incidents on february 13 1975 a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the north tower fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors as the insulation for telephone cables located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors had been ignited areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately and the original fire was put out in a few hours47 most of the damage was on the 11th floor where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper alcohol-based fluid for office machines and other office equipment fireproofing protected the steel48 and there was no structural damage to the tower47 in addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below at the time the world trade center complex had no fire sprinkler systems47 underground damage from 1993 bombing the first terrorist attack on the world trade center occurred on february 26 1993 at 1217p.m when a ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds 680kg of explosives planted by ramzi yousef detonated in the underground garage of the north tower49 the blast resulted in a 100 feet 30m hole through five sublevels the greatest damage was on levels b1 and b2 with significant structural damage on level b350 six people were killed and more than a thousand were injured as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time many people inside the north tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting and some took two hours or more to reach safety5152 september 11 attacks impact locations on one and two world

memorial museum performing arts center transportation hub vehicular security center westfield world trade center v t e planning and early development following the destruction of the original world trade center there was debate regarding the future of the world trade center site there were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately and by 2002 the lower manhattan development corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site64 the proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the september 11 attacks and rebuild the complex6566 when the public rejected the first round of designs a second more open competition took place in december 2002 in which a design by daniel libeskind was selected as the winner this design went through many revisions mainly because of disagreements with developer larry silverstein who held the lease to the world trade center site at that time67 there was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan only 82 floors would have been habitable and the total office space of the rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet 280,000m2 in comparison with the original complex5 the floor limit was imposed by silverstein who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident much of the buildings height would have consisted of a large open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower containing wind turbines and sky gardens5 in a subsequent design the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original world trade center and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans5 in 2002 former new york governor george pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architects design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor ron lauder68 a final design for the freedom tower was formally unveiled on june 28 2005 to address security issues raised by the new york city police department a 187-foot 57m concrete base was added to the design in april of that year the design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a concrete bunker however the prisms were later found to be unworkable as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards as a result it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass69 contrasting with libeskinds original plan the towers final design tapers octagonally as it rises its designers stated that the tower would be a monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna in 2006 larry silverstein commented on a planned completion date by 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt world trade center more magnificent more spectacular than it ever was70 on april 26 2006 the port authority of new york and new jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin a formal agreement was drafted the following day the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the empire state building construction began in may a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived71 construction and later development main article construction of one world trade center one world trade center tower construction as of august 7 2007 one world trade center construction as of april 3 2012 three months before topping off the symbolic cornerstone of one world trade center was laid in a ceremony on july 4 2004.72 the stone had an inscription supposedly written by arthur j finkelstein73 however construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money security and design72 the last major issues were resolved on april 26 2006 when a deal was made between developer larry silverstein and the port authority of new york and new jersey so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on june 23 2006.74 soon after explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the buildings foundation onto which 400 cubic yards 310 cubic meters of concrete was poured by november 2007.75 in a december 18 2006 ceremony held in nearby battery park city members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot 9.1m steel beam installed onto the buildings base7677 it was welded onto the buildings base on december 19 2006.78 foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward so the towers footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year79 in january 2008 two cranes were moved onto the site construction of the towers concrete core which began after the cranes arrived79 reached street level by may 17 however construction of the base was not finished until two years later after which construction of the office floors began and the first glass windows were subsequently installed during 2010 floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week80 an advanced cocoon scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city81 the tower reached 52 floors and was over 600 feet 180m tall by december 2010 the towers steel frame was halfway complete by then82 but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors83 in 2009 the port authority changed the official name of the building from freedom tower to one world trade center stating that this name was the easiest for people to identify with184 the change came after board members of the port authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with vantone industrial co a chinese real estate company which will become the buildings first commercial tenant vantone plans to create the china center a trade and cultural facility covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69.85 detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on the new york citys department of finance website in may 2011 resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack86 while under construction the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions87 on the weekend of july 4 2011 it was lit up with the colors of the american flag to commemorate independence day and it was lit up with the same colors on september 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks88 on october 27 of that same year it was illuminated with pink in honor of breast cancer awareness month87 on december 11 the port authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season87 on february 24 2012 the building was lit up with red in honor of archbishop of new york timothy dolan who became a cardinal on february 18.87 on june 14 2012 it was illuminated with red white and blue to honor flag day87 in august it was illuminated with red in honor of the armed forces87 on september 8 2012 it was once again illuminated with red white and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the september 11 attacks89 on june 24 2013 the building was again illuminated with red white and blue to celebrate the fourth of july87 on november 12 2013 three hundred red white and blue lights were lit up90 the towers loading dock however was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars the temporary path station was not to be removed until its official replacement the world trade center transportation hub was completed blocking access to the planned loading area91 by march 2012 one world trade centers steel structure had reached 93 floors92 growing to 94 floors and 1,240 feet 380m by the end of the month93 however because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements the 94th floor was numbered floor 100 because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor which was used for mechanical purposes93 the still-incomplete tower became new york citys tallest building by roof height in april 2012 passing the 1,250-foot 380m roof height of the empire state building9495 president barack obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower the sentence we remember we rebuild we come back stronger96 that same month with the towers structure nearing completion the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building seeking to attract visitors and tenants97 one world trade centers steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor with a total height of 1,368 feet 417m in august 2012.6998 the towers antenna was shipped to new york in november 201299 the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on december 12 2012,100 and was installed on january 15 2013.101 by march 2013 two sections of the antenna had been installed the spires completion was scheduled for april 29 2013 but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces102 on may 10 2013 the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of one world trade center bringing the tower to its full height of 1,776 feet 541m and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world as well as the tallest in the city surpassing the 1,454-foot 443m empire state building69103 in subsequent months the exterior elevator shaft was removed the podium glass interior decorations and other finishings were being installed and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed92 a report in september 2013 revealed that at the time of the report the world trade center association wtca was negotiating with regard to the world trade center name as the wtca had purchased the rights to the name in 1986 the wtca sought 500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of world trade center in the towers name and associated souvenirs104 on november 12 2013 the height committee of the chicago-based council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh made the controversial105 announcement that one world trade center was the tallest building in the united states at 1,776 feet declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the buildings architecture106107 by the same reasoning the building was also the tallest in the western hemisphere108

with the building of the new tower109 the building opened on november 3 2014 and cond nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors110111112113 cond nast occupies floors 20 to 44 having completed its move in early 2015.109 it is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40 of unleased space in the tower109 as cond nast had revitalized times square after moving there in 1999.114 only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day future tenants will include kids creative legends hospitality the bmb group servcorp115 and gq114 disabled suspended working platform used for maintenance activities on southern exposure on november 12 2014 the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked the cables were manufactured by tractel and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the buildings exterior at the time the platform was holding a two-man seiu-affiliated window washing team the slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower the workers were rescued by over 100 fdny firefighters who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass after the incident the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia and were taken to the hospital116117118 estimated cost and funding an estimate in february 2007 placed the initial construction cost of one world trade center at about 3 billion or 1,150 per square foot 12,380 per square meter119 however the towers total estimated construction cost had risen to 3.9 billion by april 2012 making it the most expensive building in the world at the time23 the towers construction was partly funded by approximately 1billion of insurance money that silverstein received for his losses in the september 11 attacks119 the state of new york provided an additional 250million and the port authority agreed to give 1billion which would be obtained through the sale of bonds120 the port authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015 however the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the towers construction3121 architecture and design preliminary site plans for the world trade centers reconstruction in orange are the new buildings one world trade center is the square at upper left and in blue is the 911 memorial and museum many of daniel libeskinds original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the towers final design one world trade centers final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary new york skyline the towers central spire draws from previous buildings such as the empire state building and the chrysler building it also visually resembles the original twin towers rather than being an off-center spire similar to the statue of liberty122123124125126 the building occupies a 200-foot 61m square with an area of 40,000 square feet 3,700m2 nearly identical to the footprints of the original twin towers the tower is built upon a 185-foot 56m tall windowless concrete base designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks127 originally the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass but a simpler glass-and-steel faade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable69 the current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels similar to those on 7 world trade center led lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night128 cable-net glass faades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors designed by schlaich bergermann will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex the faades are 60 feet 18m high and range in width from 30 feet 9.1m on the east and west sides 50 feet 15m on the north side and 70 feet 21m on the south side10 the curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by benson industries in portland oregon using glass made in minnesota by viracon129 from the 20th floor upwards the square edges of the towers cubic base are chamfered back shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles or an elongated square antiprism130 near its middle the tower forms a perfect octagon and then culminates in a glass parapet whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base a 408-foot 124 m sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna designed in a collaboration between skidmore owings and merrill som artist kenneth snelson who invented the tensegrity structure lighting designers and engineers is secured by a system of cables and rises from a circular support ring which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment at night an intense beam of light is projected horizontally from the spire8 and shines over 1,000 feet 300m above the tower131 david childs of som the architect of one world trade center said the following regarding the towers design132 we really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real not just in sculptural sketches we explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling not just beautiful the design does have great sculptural implications and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower but it also has to be a highly efficient building the discourse about freedom tower has often been limited to the symbolic formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesnt function well if people dont want to work and visit there then we will have failed as architects132 layout entrance of one world trade center just south of the new one world trade center is the national september 11 memorial museum which is located where the original twin towers stood immediately to the east is world trade center transportation hub and the new two world trade center site to the north is seven world trade center and to the west is brookfield place133134135 one world trade centers top floor is officially designated as floor 104,4 despite the fact that the tower only contains 94 actual stories136 the building has 86 usable above-ground floors of which 78 are intended for office purposes approximately 2,600,000 square feet 240,000m2.8137138 the base consists of floors 119 including a 65-foot-high 20 m public lobby the office floors begin at floor 20 and go up to floor 63 there is a sky lobby on floor 64 office floors resume on floor 65 and stop at floor 90 floors 9199 and 103104 are mechanical floors10 visitors looking toward new jersey from one world observatory the tower has a three-story observation deck located on floors 100102 in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities10 similar to in the empire state building visitors will be separated from the tenants having their own separate entrance next to the museum descending down to a below-ground security screening area139 on the observation deck the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor but there will be a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor140 to show visitors the city and give them information and stories about new york an interactive tool called city pulse is used by tour ambassadors the admission fee will be 32 per person141142 but admission discounts are available for children and seniors and the deck will be free for 911 responders and families of 911 victims140 when it opens the deck is expected to have about 3.5 million visitors per year143 tickets went on sale starting on april 8.144 however the manhattan district attorney probed the port authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck145 it officially opened on may 28 2015,146147 one day ahead of schedule148 there are three eating venues at the top of the building a caf called one caf a bar and small plates grill one mix and a fine dining restaurant one dining some have criticized the food prices the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter and their reputations compared to windows on the world the top-floor restaurant in the original one world trade center149150 the tenants have access to below-ground parking storage and shopping access to path new york city subway trains and the world financial center is also provided at the world trade center transportation hub fulton streetfulton center chambers street and cortlandt street stations151 the building allows direct access to west street vesey street and fulton street at ground level151 the building has an approximate underground footprint of 42,000 square feet 3,900m2,151 of which 55,000 square feet 5,100m2 is retail space a plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower similar to the original one world trade centers windows on the world was abandoned as logistically impractical the towers window-washing tracks are located on a 16-square-foot area which will be designated as floor 110 as a symbolic reference to the 110 floors of the original tower152 view of manhattan from the observatory brooklyn bridge as viewed from the observatory west street viewed from the observatory statue of liberty as viewed from the observatory design evolution the original design went through significant changes after the durst organization joined the port authority of new york and new jersey as the co-developer of the project in 2010.122 height comparison of major skyscrapers in new york city with one world trade center shown at far left the north tower of wtc was 1,727 ft 526.3 m the 185-foot 56m tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward and have prismatic glass122125 the corners were later squared in addition the bases walls are now covered in hundreds of pairs of 13-foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight-inch-wide stainless-steel slats122125 the spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome described as a sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels122123124 however the radome-enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna122 douglas durst the chairman of the durst organization stated that the design change would save 20 million124153 however the towers architect skidmore owings merrill strongly criticized the change david childs the lead designer said eliminating this integral part of the buildings design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunatewe stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design124 after joining the project in 2010 the durst organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs but the proposal was rejected by the port authoritys then-executive director christopher o ward124 ward was replaced by patrick foye in september 2011.123 foye changed the port authoritys position and the radome was removed from the plans in 2012 douglas durst gave a statement regarding the final decision the antenna is going to be mounted on the building over the summer theres no way to do anything at this point124 the north pool of the national september 11 memorial adjacent to one world trade center the large triangular plaza on the west side of one world trade center facing the hudson river was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street however the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design the terrace can be accessed through a staircase on vesey street the terrace is paved in granite and has 12 sweetgum trees in addition to a block-long planterbench122 durst also removed a skylight from the plazas plans the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below-ground observation deck lobby122 the plaza is 5ft 8in 1.73m higher than the adjacent sidewalk122 the port authority formally approved all these revisions and the revisions were first reported by the new york post154 patrick foye the executive director of the port authority said that he thought that the changes were few and minor in a telephone interview122 a contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization states that the durst organization will receive a 15 million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of the savings up to 24 million with further returns going down to 50 percent 25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase122 height when viewed from street level in proximity to the tower one world trade center freedom tower appears to ascend to a pyramid point as seen in this view of the west street side of the building spire on the top of one world trade center building as viewed from the ground the top floor of one world trade center is 1,368 feet 417m above ground level along with a 33ft 4in 10.16m parapet this is identical to the roof height of the original one world trade center155 the towers antennaspire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1,776 feet 541m,4156 a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776 when the united states declaration of independence was signed8157158159 if the antenna is included in the buildings height as stated by the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh one world trade center surpasses the height of taipei 101 1,671-foot 509m is the worlds tallest all-office building and the fourth-tallest skyscraper in the world behind the burj khalifa30 abraj al bait160 and shanghai tower161 one world trade center is the second-tallest freestanding structure in the western hemisphere as the cn tower in toronto exceeds one world trade centers pinnacle height by approximately 12m 39.4ft.162 the chicago spire with a planned height of 2,000 feet 610m was expected to exceed the height of one world trade center but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009.163 after design changes for one world trade centers spire were revealed in may 2012 there were questions as to whether the 408-foot 124m-tall structure would still qualify as a spire and thus be included in the buildings height164165 since the towers spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned it could be classified as a simple antenna which is not included in a buildings height according to the ctbuh165 without the antenna one world trade center would be 1,368 feet 417m tall making it the fourth-tallest building in the united states behind the willis tower and trump international hotel tower both located in chicago and 432 park avenue in new york166167 the building is currently the tallest in new york city with the antenna however without the antenna it was surpassed in 2015 by 432 park avenue which topped out at 1,396 feet 426m high168169170 one world trade centers developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign171 with port authority spokesman steve coleman reiterating that one world trade center will be the tallest building in the western hemisphere164 in 2012 the ctbuh announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the buildings height164 on november 12 2013 the ctbuh announced that one world trade centers spire would count as part of the buildings recognized height giving it a final height of 1,776feet and making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere106 sustainability like other buildings in the new world trade center complex one world trade center includes sustainable architecture features much of the buildings structure and interior is built from recycled materials including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles around 80percent of the towers waste products are recycled172 although the roof area of any tower is limited the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems the buildings purecell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts mw of power and its waste steam generates electricity173 the new york power authority selected utc power to provide the towers fuel cell system which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed174 the tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power175 the windows are made of an ultra-clear glass which allows maximum sunlight to pass through the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days reducing energy costs131 like all of the new facilities at the world trade center site one world trade center is heated by steam with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site176 one world trade center is expected to receive a leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold certification making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world177 safety and security security features one world trade center and 7 world trade center at night along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base a number of other safety features were included in the buildings design so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack like 7 world trade center the building has 3-foot 91cm thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells elevator shafts risers and sprinkler systems there are also extra-wide pressurized stairwells along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system131177 in comparison the original twin towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions protected only by lightweight drywall panels178 the building is no longer 25 feet 8m away from west street as the twin towers were at its closest point west street is 65 feet 20m away the windows facing west street are equipped with specially tempered blast-resistant plastic which looks almost like the glass used in the other sides of the building131 the port authority has stated its structure is designed around a strong redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting paired with a concrete-core shear wall the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column-free interior spans for maximum flexibility177 in addition to safety design new security measures will be implemented all vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the nypd a computer system will use video-analytic computer software designed to detect potential threats such as unattended bags and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects new york city and port authority police will patrol the site179 once the world trade center site is fully completed the plaza will be completely opened to the public as the original world trade center plaza was180 the initial stage of the opening process began on thursday may 15 2014 when the interim operating period of the national september 11 memorial ended during this period all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening181 as part of the interim operating period which was expected to end on december 31 2013.182 however screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum183184 on may 21 2014 after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes180 incidents in march 2014 the tower was scaled by 16-year-old new jersey resident justin casquejo who entered the site through a hole in a fence he was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges185 he allegedly dressed like a construction worker sneaked in and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the towers 88th floor according to news sources he then used stairways to get to the 104th floor walked past a sleeping security guard and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna where he took pictures for two hours186 the elevator operator was reassigned and the guard was fired187188 it was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower which facilitated casquejos entry to the site189190 less than a week after the trespassing incident four peoplethree male parachutists one of whom was a construction worker at the site and their lookoutwere arrested for a base jump they conducted on september 30 2013.191192 they had posted a video of the jump online193 as a result of these incidents the durst organizations head of security at one world trade center david velazquez resigned on march 28 2014.194 controversies the social center of the previous one world trade center included a restaurant on the 107th floor called windows on the world and the greatest bar on earth these were tourist attractions in their own right and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers195196 this restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the united states called windows on the world wine school run by wine personality kevin zraly197 despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt198 the port authority scrapped plans to rebuild them which has outraged some observers199 the fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy some critics including deroy murdock of the national review200 have said that it is alienating and dull and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom leading them to dub the building the fear tower201 nicolai ouroussoff the architecture critic for the new york times calls the tower base a grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia202 statue in front of the building main article americas response monument americas response monument the americas response monument a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of us special operations forces in the first few weeks of the war in afghanistan was unveiled to the public during the veterans day parade in new york city on november 11 2011 the statue was displayed on a float which traveled along fifth avenue north from 23rd street to 56th street203 it was dedicated that same day in a ceremony led by vice president joe biden and lieutenant-general john mulholland commander of us army special operations command and formerly commander of task force dagger during the initial days of the war in afghanistan204205 it was temporarily located in the west street lobby inside one world financial center in new york city opposite ground zero204205 it is the first public monument to honor united states special forces206207 there is also a monument commemorating the green berets on meadows memorial field in fort bragg north carolina208 on october 19 2012 the monument was rededicated in front of the tower207 the inscription at base of the sculpture bears its name americas response monument and the latin subtitle de oppresso liber the subtitle traditionally translated as to free the oppressed is the motto of the green berets who inspired the monument209 a piece of steel from the original world trade center is embedded in the base210 the statue was dedicated by lieutenant general john mulholland deputy commanding general of us army special forces command soldiers representing the united states army special operations command attended the dedication ceremony211 the land on which the monument stands was donated by a private wall street firm212 the statue cost over 750,000 to make but all the needed money was donated by hundreds of private citizens including some survivors of the september 11 attacks213214 owners and tenants one world trade center is principally owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey around 5percent equity of the building was sold to the durst organization a private real estate company in exchange for an investment of at least 100million the durst organization assisted in supervising the buildings construction and manages the building for the port authority having responsibility for leasing property management and tenant installations215216 by september 2012 around 55percent of the buildings floor space had been leased217 but no new leases were signed for three years until may 2014218 the amount of space leased had gone up to 62.8percent by november 2014.219 in 2006 the state of new york agreed to a 15-year 415,000 square feet 38,600m2 lease with an option to extend the leases term and occupy up to 1,000,000 square feet 90,000m2.220 the general services administration gsa initially agreed to a lease of around 645,000 square feet 59,900m2,176220 and new york states office of general services ogs planned to occupy around 412,000 square feet 38,300m2 however the gsa ceded most of its floor space to the port authority in july 2011 and the ogs withdrew from the lease contract221 in april 2008 the port authority announced that it was seeking a bidder to operate the 18,000sqft 1,700m2 observation deck on the towers 102nd floor222 in 2013 legends hospitality management agreed to operate the observatory in a 15-year 875 million contract223 the buildings first lease a joint project between the port authority and beijing-based vantone industrial was announced on march 28 2009 a 190,810sqft

midtown manhattan-based law firm was to sign a 300,000 square feet 30,000m2 lease contract229 but after negotiations broke down the deal was abruptly canceled in march230 key figures developer larry silverstein of silverstein properties the leaseholder and developer of the complex retains control of the surrounding buildings while the port authority has full control of the tower itself silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the world trade center site in july 2001 and remains actively involved in most aspects of the sites redevelopment process231 before construction of the new tower began silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower the terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001 for which silverstein paid 14 million232 gave silverstein as leaseholder the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed233 after the september 11 attacks there were a series of disputes between silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers this resulted in the construction of one world trade center being delayed after a trial resulted a verdict was given on april 29 2004 the verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the one occurrence interpretation so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies three insurers were added to the second trial group234235 at that time the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer swiss reinsurance but it did so several days later on may 3 2004 finding that this company was also subject to the one occurrence interpretation236 silverstein appealed the swiss reinsurance decision but the appeal failed on october 19 2006.237 the second trial resulted in a verdict on december 6 2004 the jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the two occurrences interpretation referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the september 11 attacks they were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies 2.2 billion238 the highest potential payout was 4.577 billion for buildings 1 2 4 and 5.239 in march 2007 silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference he highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers allianz and royal sun alliance to pay 800 million in claims related to the attacks insurers state that an agreement to split payments between silverstein and the port authority is a cause for concern240 key project coordinators david childs one of silversteins favorite architects joined the project after silverstein urged him to do so he developed a design proposal for one world trade center initially collaborating with daniel libeskind in may 2005 childs revised the design to address security concerns he is the architect of the tower and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development241 daniel libeskind won the 2002 competition to develop a master plan for the world trade centers redevelopment architect daniel libeskind won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in 2002 he gave an initial proposal which he called memory foundations for the design of one world trade center his design included aerial gardens windmills and off-center spire126 libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the path station he instead placed it another block west as it would then line up with and resemble the statue of liberty242 most of libeskinds original designs were later scrapped and other architects were chosen to design the other wtc buildings243 however one element of libeskinds initial plan was included in the final design the towers symbolic height of 1,776 feet 541m.244 daniel r tishman along with his father john tishman builder of the original world trade center led the construction team from tishman realty construction the selected builder for one world trade center245246 douglas and jody durst the co-presidents of the durst organization a real estate development company won the right to invest at least 100million in the project on july 7 2010.247 in august 2010 cond nast a long-time durst tenant confirmed a tentative deal to move into 1 world trade center248249250 and finalized the deal on may 26 2011.251 the contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization specifies that the durst organization will receive a 15 million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst 75 percent of savings up to 24 million stepping down to 50 25 and 15 percent as savings increase122 since durst joined the project significant changes have been made to the building including the 185 foot base of the tower the spire and the plaza to the west of the building facing the hudson river the port authority has approved all the revisions122 port authority construction workers a woodsearch films short-subject documentary entitled how does it feel to work on one world trade center was uploaded to youtube on august 31 2010 it depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site252 however further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of one world trade center including 34 not reported to the us occupational safety and health administration253 workers also left post-911-related graffiti at the site which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience254 see also architecture portal new york city portal one world
