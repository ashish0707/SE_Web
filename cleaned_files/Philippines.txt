oldest human remains known in the philippines the tabon man the metatarsal of the callao man reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67,000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date36 this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago39 negritos were also among the archipelagos earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated40 there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos f landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally wilhelm solheims island origin theory41 postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000bc rather than by wide-scale migration the austronesian expansion theory postulates that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000bc displacing earlier arrivals42 the most widely accepted theory based on linguistic and archeological evidence is the out-of-taiwan model which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture43 began migrating to the philippines around 4000bc displacing earlier arrivals45 during the neolithic period a jade culture is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000bc.4647 the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies48

many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of eastern southern and southeastern asia including those from brunei china india indonesia malaysia and japan as well as other austronesian islands52 the first millennium saw the rise of the port principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of or allied with larger nations which were either malay thalassocracies led by datus tributary states to china ruled by huangs or indianized kingdoms governed by rajahs53 the kedatuan of madja-as was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah called makatunao and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas its founding datu puti had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero marikudo54 madja-as was founded on panay island named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra afterwards the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy55 the rajahnate of cebu56 was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay a monarch with partial tamil descent this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping routes within the archipelago57 meanwhile the rajahnate of butuan in northeastern mindanao attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja51 who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and also maintained commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilization both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu maintained contact and traded with kutai a hindu country58 in south borneo established by indian traders59 the huangdom of ma-i centered in mindoro ruled by huang gat-sa-lihan was noted for its trust-worthiness in trade60 in northern luzon the huangdom of pangasinan under huang taymey exported horses and silver to china the kingdom of ryukyu and japan6162 in central luzon the kingdom of tondo was ruled over by the lakandula dynasty and the kingdom grew wealthy via the exclusive trading-rights of chinese goods which they marketed in southeast asia this was granted to them by the ming dynasty6364 the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago in 1380 karim ul makdum and shariful hashem syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulus rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter6566 at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao67 images from the boxer codex illustrating the ancient kadatuan or

prominence by participating in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar malacca and east timor686970 where they were employed as traders and mercenaries717273 islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 this was accomplished because the bruneian empire subjugated the kingdom of tondo by defeating rajah gambang and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah sulaiman i to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the kingdom of maynila74757677 sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand bruneis influence in both luzon and mindanao78 the muslims then proceeded to wage war and conduct slave-raids against the visayans79 nevertheless states like the animist igorot malay madja-as sinified ma-i and indianized butuan still maintained their cultures the rivalries between the datus rajahs huangs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated80 due to consistent natural disasters81 and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized82 colonial era further

against the sultanate of brunei91 and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore in response to ternatan slaving and piracy against bohol and butuan92 fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the stronghold of tungning93 however the invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas94 spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago from

bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the katipunan who sought independence from spain through armed revolt111 bonifacio and the katipunan started the philippine revolution in 1896 a

spain according to the terms of the 1898 treaty of paris116 as it became increasingly clear the united states would not recognize the nascent first philippine republic the philippineamerican war broke out the first republic was defeated and the archipelago was administered under an insular government117 the war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians mostly from a cholera epidemic121 the americans then suppressed other rebellious sub-states mainly the waning sultanate of sulu as well as the insurgent tagalog republic the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao124 during this era a renaissance in philippine culture occurred with the expansion of philippine cinema and

atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the bataan death march and the manila massacre that culminated during the battle of manila133 in 1944 quezon died in exile in the united states and sergio osmea succeeded him the allied forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the philippine archipelago in the process retaking territory conquered by imperial japan from mid-1942 through mid-1944 the filipino guerrilla resistance134135 had been supplied and encouraged by us navy submarines and a few parachute drops so that the guerrillas could harass the japanese army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas amounting to about half of the philippine archipelago while remaining loyal to the united states many filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence eventually the largest naval battle in history according to gross tonnage the battle of leyte gulf
