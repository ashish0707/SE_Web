not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics the three towers of the ivanpah solar power facility part of the 354mw segs solar complex in northern san bernardino county california concentrated solar power also called concentrating solar power concentrated solar thermal and csp systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight or solar thermal energy onto a small area electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat which drives a heat engine usually a steam turbine connected to an electrical power generator 123 or powers a thermochemical reaction experimental as of 2013update.456 csp is being widely commercialized and the csp market saw about 740 megawatt mw of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010 more than half of this about 478mw was installed during 2010 bringing the global total to 1095mw spain added 400mw in 2010 taking the global lead with a total of 632mw while the us ended the year with 509mw after adding 78mw including two fossilcsp hybrid plants7 the middle east is also ramping up their plans to install csp based projects and as a part of that plan shams-i which was the largest csp project in the world has been installed in abu dhabi by masdar8 the largest csp project in the world until january 2016 is noor in morocco9 and global operational power stands at 4,705mw there is considerable academic and commercial interest internationally in a new form of csp called stem for off-grid applications to produce 24-hour industrial scale power for mining sites and remote communities in italy other parts of europe australia asia north africa and latin america stem uses fluidized silica sand as a thermal storage and heat transfer medium for csp systems it has been developed by salerno-based magaldi industries the first commercial application of stem was scheduled to take place in sicily from 2015.10 csp growth is expected to continue at a fast pace as of january 2014 spain had a total capacity of 2,300mw making this country the world leader in csp united states follows with 1,740mw interest is also notable in north africa and the middle east as well as india and china in italy a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants totalling 392mw despite a strong local and political opposition11 the global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants which account for 90 of csp plants7 csp is not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics cpv in cpv the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the photovoltaic effect ivanpah in california is running 69 percent below advertised power output and one spanish company abengoa that commercialized csp both in the us and abroad is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy csp technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics solar panels which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels12 another drawback of ivanpah is that it lacks thermal energy storage one of the big advantages that csp has over pv and most other renewables which require either large scale energy storage systems like pumped hydro or fast acting natural gas power plants to be there as backup for those times when they are not producing much energy contents 1 history 2 current technology 2.1 parabolic trough 2.1.1 enclosed

burning glass to concentrate sunlight on the invading roman fleet and repel them from syracuse in 1973 a greek scientist dr ioannis sakkas curious about whether archimedes could really have destroyed the roman fleet in 212 bc lined up nearly 60 greek sailors each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the suns rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette 160 feet away the ship caught fire after a few minutes however historians continue to doubt the archimedes story13 in 1866 auguste mouchout used a parabolic trough to produc steam for the first solar steam engine the first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the italian alessandro battaglia in genoa italy in 1886 over the following years invntors such as john ericsson and frank shuman developed concentrating solar-powered dvices for irrigation refrigration and locomtion in 1913 shuman finished a 55hp parabolic solar thermal energy station in maadi egypt for irrigation14151617 the first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by dr rh goddard who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed18 professor giovanni francia 19111980 designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant which entered into operation in santilario near genoa italy in 1968 this plant had the architecture of todays concentrated-solar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors the plant was able to produce 1mw with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500c.19 the 10mw solar one power tower was developed in southern california in 1981 but the parabolic-trough technology of the nearby solar energy generating systems segs begun in 1984 was more workable the 354mw segs is still the largest solar power plant in the world and will remain so until the 390mw ivanpah power tower project reaches full power current technologyedit csp is used to produce electricity sometimes called solar thermoelectricity usually generated through steam concentrated-solar technology systems use mirrors or lenses with tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area the concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant solar thermoelectricity the solar concentrators used in csp systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling such as in solar air-conditioning concentrating technologies exist in five common forms namely parabolic trough enclosed trough dish stirlings concentrating linear fresnel reflector and solar power tower20 although simple these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration2122 for example the parabolic-trough concentration gives about of the theoretical maximum for the design acceptance angle that is for the same overall tolerances for the system approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics212223 different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light new innovations in csp technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective24 parabolic troughedit parabolic trough at a plant near harper lake california main article parabolic trough a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflectors focal line the receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid the reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis a working fluid eg molten salt25 is heated to 150350c 300660f as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system26 trough systems are the most developed csp technology the solar energy generating systems segs plants in california the worlds first commercial parabolic trough plants accionas nevada solar one near boulder city nevada and andasol europes first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative along with plataforma solar de almeras ssps-dcs test facilities in spain27 enclosed troughedit enclosed trough systems are used to absorb heat rather than process heat the design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse the glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system28 lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires a single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight the mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes also suspended from the glasshouse structure29 water is carried throughout the length of the pipe which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors28 inside an enclosed trough system glasspoint solar the company that created the enclosed trough design states its technology can produce heat for enhanced oil recovery eor for about 5 per million british thermal units in sunny regions compared to between 10 and 12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies30 solar power toweredit main article solar power tower the ps10 solar power plant in andaluca spain concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats onto a central solar power tower a solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors heliostats that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower the receiver contains a fluid deposit which can consist of sea water the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 5001000c 7731,273k 9321,832f and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system26 an advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability the solar two in daggett california and the cesa-1 in plataforma solar de almeria almeria spain are the most representative demonstration plants the planta solar 10 ps10 in sanlucar la mayor spain is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world the 377mw ivanpah solar power facility located in the mojave desert is the largest csp facility in the world and uses three power towers31 the national solar thermal test facility nsttf located in albuquerque nm is an experimental solar thermal test facility with a heliostat field capable of producing 6mw fresnel reflectorsedit main article compact linear fresnel reflector fresnel reflectors are made of many thin flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space as a parabolic reflector thus capturing more of the available sunlight and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors fresnel reflectors can be used in various size csps3233 dish stirlingedit a dish stirling main article dish stirling a dish stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflectors focal point the reflector tracks the sun along two axes the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250700c 4801,300f and then used by a stirling engine to generate power26 parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency between 31 and 32 and their modular nature provides scalability the stirling energy systems ses united sun systems uss and science applications international corporation saic dishes at unlv and australian national universitys big dish in canberra australia are representative of this technology a world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25 by ses dishes at the national solar thermal test facility nsttf in new mexico on january 31 2008 a cold bright day34 according to its developer ripasso energy a swedish firm in 2015 its dish sterling system being tested in the kalahari desert in south africa showed 34 efficiency35 the ses installation in maricopa phoenix was the largest stirling dish power installation in the world until it was sold to united sun systems subsequently larger parts of the installation have been moved to china as part of the huge energy demand large air mass solar poweredit a concentrated solar power process developed in 2015 whereby a the temperature of a large contained mass of air is varied by a relatively small amounts this method has the potential to be an extremely efficient way to both harness and store solar power since the expansive and contractive forces generated by the large air mass can be directly used to fill reservoirs this process could make practical the construction of coastal reservoirs powered by seawater solar thermal enhanced oil recoveryedit main article solar thermal enhanced oil recovery heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no

however as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation it tends to favour more established re technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation such as large scale onshore wind rather than solar thermal and csp56 at state level renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kwp and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar pv photovoltaic generation this means that larger scale csp projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the state and territory jurisdictions futureedit a study done by greenpeace international the european solar thermal electricity association and the international energy agencys solarpaces group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power the study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25 of the worlds energy needs by 2050 the increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 92.5 billion euros in that time period57 spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works also it exports its technology further increasing the technologys stake in energy worldwide because the technology works best with areas of high insolation solar radiation experts predict the biggest growth in places like africa mexico and the southwest united states it indicates that the thermal storage systems based in nitrates calcium potassium sodium will make the csp plants more and more profitable the study examined three different outcomes for this technology no increases in csp technology investment continuing as it has been in spain and the us and finally the true potential of csp without

0.140.10kwh.57 recently the eu has begun to look into developing a 400 billion 774 billion network of solar power plants based in the sahara region using csp technology known as desertec to create a new carbon-free network linking europe the middle east and north africa the plan is backed mainly by german industrialists and predicts production of 15 of europes power by 2050 morocco is a major partner in desertec and as it has barely 1 of the electricity consumption of the eu it will produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to europe58 algeria has the biggest area of desert and private algerian firm cevital has signed up for desertec58 with its wide desert the highest csp potential in the mediterranean and middle east regions about 170 twhyear and its strategic geographical location near europe algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of desertec project moreover with the abundant natural-gas reserve in the algerian desert this will strengthen the technical potential of algeria in acquiring solar-gas hybrid power plants for 24-hour electricity generation other organizations expect csp to cost 0.06uskwh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment59 that would make csp as cheap as conventional power investors such as venture capitalist vinod khosla expect csp to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015 on 9september 2009 7 years ago2009-09-09 bill weihl googleorgs green-energy spokesperson said that the firm was conducting research on the heliostat mirrors and gas turbine technology which he expects will drop the cost of solar thermal electric power to less than 0.05kwh in 2 or 3 years47 in 2009 scientists at the national renewable energy laboratory nrel and skyfuel teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30 less expensive than todays best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a silver polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors but at much lower cost and weight it also is much easier to deploy and install the glossy film uses several layers of polymers with an inner layer of pure silver telescope designer roger angel univ of arizona has turned his attention to cpv and is a partner in a company called rehnu angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with large-telescope technologies but much cheaper materials and mechanisms to create efficient systems60 recent experience with csp technology in 2014 - 2015 at solana in arizona and ivanpah in nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent producers blame clouds and stormy weather but critics seem to think there are technological issues these problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity and threaten the long-term viability of the technology as photovoltaic costs continue to plummet many think csp has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production61 on the other side part of photovoltaic costs drop is the result of the fossil fuel cost reductions which still powers most of pv production instead csp would be unaffected when fossil prices return to higher quotes very large scale solar power plantsedit there are several proposals
