a sample of thorium the thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses the isotope of thorium 232th as the fertile material in the reactor 232th is transmuted into the fissile artificial uranium isotope 233u which is the nuclear fuel unlike natural uranium natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material such as 231th which are insufficient to initiate a nuclear chain reaction additional fissile material or another neutron source are necessary to initiate the fuel cycle in a thorium-fuelled reactor 232th absorbs neutrons eventually to produce 233u this parallels the process in uranium breeder reactors whereby fertile 238u absorbs neutrons to form fissile 239pu depending on the design of the reactor and fuel cycle the generated 233u either fissions in situ or is chemically separated from the used nuclear fuel and formed into new nuclear fuel the thorium fuel cycle claims several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including thoriums greater abundance superior physical and nuclear properties better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation123 and reduced plutonium and actinide production3 contents 1 history 2 nuclear reactions with

references 7 further reading 8 external links historyedit concerns about the limits of worldwide uranium resources motivated initial interest in the thorium fuel cycle4 it was envisioned that as uranium reserves were depleted thorium would supplement uranium as a fertile material however for most countries uranium was relatively abundant and research in thorium fuel cycles waned a notable exception was indias three-stage nuclear power programme5 in the twenty-first century thoriums potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle678 at oak ridge national laboratory in the 1960s the molten-salt reactor experiment used 233u as the fissile fuel as an experiment to demonstrate a part of the molten salt breeder reactor that was designed to operate on the thorium fuel cycle molten salt reactor msr experiments assessed thoriums feasibility using thoriumiv fluoride dissolved in a molten salt fluid that eliminated the need to fabricate fuel elements the msr program was defunded in 1976 after its patron alvin weinberg was fired9 in 2006 carlo rubbia proposed the concept of an energy amplifier or accelerator driven system ads which he saw as a novel and safe way to produce nuclear energy that exploited existing accelerator technologies rubbias proposal offered the potential to incinerate high-activity nuclear waste and produce energy from natural thorium and depleted uranium1011 kirk sorensen former nasa scientist and chief nuclear technologist at teledyne brown engineering has been a long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors lftrs he first researched thorium reactors while working at nasa while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies in 2006 sorensen started energyfromthoriumcom to promote and make information available about this technology12 a 2011 mit study concluded that although there is little in the way of barriers to a thorium fuel cycle with current or near term light-water reactor designs there is also little incentive for any significant market penetration to occur as such they conclude there is little chance of thorium cycles replacing conventional uranium cycles in the current nuclear power market despite the potential benefits13 nuclear reactions with thoriumedit thorium is like wet wood it needs to be turned into fissile uranium just as wet wood needs to be dried in a furnace ratan kumar sinha current chairman of the atomic energy commission of india14 in the thorium cycle fuel is formed when 232th captures a neutron whether in a fast reactor or thermal reactor to become 233th this normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino by decay to become 233pa this then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second decay to become 233u the fuel n neutron 232 90 th 233 90 th 233 91 pa 233 92 u fuel displaystyle ce overset neutronn_90232th-_90233th-beta -_91233pa-beta

studies15 the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes and after a few hundred years the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the uranium ore that would have been used to produce low enriched uranium fuel for a light water reactor of the same power other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods16 actinide wastesedit in a reactor when a neutron hits a fissile atom such as certain isotopes of uranium it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom in the case of 233u the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than transuranic wastes when 233u absorbs a neutron it either fissions or becomes 234u the chance of fissioning on absorption of a thermal neutron is about 92 the capture-to-fission ratio of 233u therefore is about 112 which is better than the corresponding capture vs fission ratios of 235u about 16 or 239pu or 241pu both about 13.417 the result is less transuranic waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle transmutation in the thorium fuel cycle 230th 231th 232th

is not fissile but neutron capture produces fissile 235u if the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture it produces 236u 237np 238pu and eventually fissile 239pu and heavier isotopes of plutonium the 237np can be removed and stored as waste or retained and transmuted to plutonium where more of it fissions while the remainder becomes 242pu then americium and curium which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission however the 231pa with a half-life of 70121031933520000003.27104years formed via n2n reactions with 232th yielding

use in military bomb triggers 232u cannot be chemically separated from 233u from used nuclear fuel however chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product 228th and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain which gradually build up as 228th reaccumulates the hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing nuclear fueledit as a fertile material thorium is similar to 238u the major part of natural and depleted uranium the thermal neutron absorption cross section a and resonance integral average of neutron cross sections over intermediate neutron energies for 232th are about three and one third times those of the respective values for 238u advantagesedit thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in earths crust18 although present knowledge of reserves is limited current demand for thorium has been satisfied as a by-product of rare-earth extraction from monazite sands although the thermal neutron fission cross section f of the resulting 233u is comparable to 235u and 239pu it has a much lower capture cross section than the latter two fissile isotopes providing fewer non-fissile neutron absorptions and improved neutron economy finally the ratio of neutrons released per neutron absorbed in 233u is greater than two over a wide range of energies including the thermal spectrum as a result thorium-based fuels can be the basis for a thermal breeder reactor4 a breeding reactor in the uranium - plutonium cycle needs to use a fast neutron spectrum because in the thermal spectrum one neutron absorbed by 239pu on average leads to less than two neutrons thorium-based fuels also display favorable physical and chemical properties that improve reactor and repository performance compared to the predominant reactor fuel uranium dioxide uo 2 thorium dioxide tho 2 has a higher melting point higher thermal conductivity and lower coefficient of thermal expansion thorium dioxide also exhibits greater chemical stability and unlike uranium dioxide does not further oxidize4 because the 233u produced in thorium fuels is significantly contaminated with 232u in proposed power reactor designs thorium-based used nuclear fuel possesses inherent proliferation resistance 232u cannot be chemically separated from 233u and has several decay products that emit high-energy gamma radiation these high-energy photons are a radiological hazard that necessitate the use of remote handling of separated uranium and aid in the passive detection of such materials the long-term on the order of roughly 7003100000000000000103 to 7013315576000000000106years radiological hazard of conventional uranium-based used nuclear fuel is dominated by plutonium and other minor actinides after which long-lived fission products become significant contributors again a single neutron capture in 238u is sufficient to produce transuranic elements whereas five captures are generally necessary to do so from 232th 9899 of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233u or 235u so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced because of this thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide mox fuels to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium19 disadvantagesedit there are several challenges to the application of thorium as a nuclear fuel particularly for solid fuel reactors in contrast to uranium naturally occurring thorium is effectively mononuclidic and contains no fissile isotopes fissile material generally 233u 235u or plutonium must be added to achieve criticality this along with the high sintering temperature necessary to make thorium-dioxide fuel complicates fuel fabrication oak ridge national laboratory experimented with thorium tetrafluoride as fuel in a molten salt reactor from 19641969 which was expected to be easier to process and separate from contaminants that slow or stop the chain reaction in an open fuel cycle ie utilizing 233u in situ higher burnup is necessary to achieve a favorable neutron economy although thorium dioxide performed well at burnups of 170,000 mwdt and 150,000 mwdt at fort st vrain generating station and avr respectively4 challenges complicate achieving this in light water reactors lwr which compose the vast majority of existing power reactors in a once-through thorium fuel cycle the residual 233u is a long-lived radioactive isotope in the waste another challenge associated with the thorium fuel cycle is the comparatively long interval over which 232th breeds to 233u the half-life of 233pa is about 27 days which is an order of magnitude longer than the half-life of 239np as a result substantial 233pa develops in thorium-based fuels 233pa is a significant neutron absorber and although it eventually breeds into fissile 235u this requires two more neutron absorptions which degrades neutron economy and increases the likelihood of transuranic production alternatively if solid thorium is used in a closed fuel cycle in which 233u is recycled remote handling is necessary for fuel fabrication because of the high radiation levels resulting from the decay products of 232u this is also true of recycled thorium because of the presence of 228th which is part of the 232u decay sequence further unlike proven uranium fuel recycling technology eg purex recycling technology for thorium eg thorex is only under development although the presence of 232u complicates matters there are public documents showing that 233u has been used once in a nuclear weapon test the united states tested a composite 233u-plutonium bomb core in the met military effects test blast during operation teapot in 1955 though with much lower yield than expected20 though thorium-based fuels produce far less long-lived transuranics than uranium-based fuels15 some long-lived actinide products constitute a long-term radiological impact especially 231pa.16 advocates for liquid core and molten salt reactors such as lftrs claim that these technologies negate thoriums disadvantages present in solid fueled reactors as only two liquid-core fluoride salt reactors have been built the ornl are and msre and neither have used thorium it is hard to validate the exact benefits4 reactorsedit thorium fuels have fuelled
