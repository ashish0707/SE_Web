for other kinds of motors see motor disambiguation for a railroad engine see electric locomotive various electric motors compared to 9 v battery an electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy the reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator in normal motoring mode most electric motors operate through the interaction between an electric motors magnetic field and winding currents to generate force within the motor in certain applications such as in the transportation industry with traction motors electric motors can operate in both motoring and generating or braking modes to also produce electrical energy from mechanical energy found in applications as diverse as industrial fans blowers and pumps machine tools household appliances power tools and disk drives electric motors can be powered by direct current dc sources such as from batteries motor vehicles or rectifiers or by alternating current ac sources such as from the power grid inverters or generators small motors may be found in electric watches general-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use the largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts electric motors may be classified by electric power source type internal construction application type of motion output and so on electric motors are used to produce linear or rotary force torque and should be distinguished from devices such as magnetic solenoids and loudspeakers that convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical

motorsedit faradays electromagnetic experiment 18211 perhaps the first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices created by the scottish monk andrew gordon in the 1740s.2 the theoretical principle behind production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field ampres force law was discovered later by andr-marie ampre in 1820 the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was demonstrated by the british scientist michael faraday in 1821 a free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury on which a permanent magnet pm was placed when a current was passed through the wire the wire rotated around the magnet showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire3 this motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments brine substituting for toxic mercury though barlows wheel was an early refinement to this faraday demonstration these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century jedliks electromagnetic self-rotor 1827 museum of applied arts budapest the historic motor still works perfectly today4 in 1827 hungarian physicist nyos jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils after jedlik solved the technical problems of the continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator he called his early devices electromagnetic self-rotors although they were used only for instructional purposes in 1828 jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical dc motors the stator rotor and commutator the device employed no permanent magnets as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings567891011 success with dc motorsedit after many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus the prussian moritz von jacobi created the first real rotating electric motor in may 1834 that actually developed a remarkable mechanical output power his motor set a world record which was improved only four years later in september 1838 by jacobi himself his second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river it was not until 183940 that other developers worldwide managed to build motors of similar and later also of higher performance the first commutator dc electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the british scientist william sturgeon in 1832.12 following sturgeons work a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the american inventor thomas davenport which he patented in 1837 the motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute and powered machine tools and a printing press13 due to the high cost of primary battery power the motors were commercially unsuccessful and davenport went bankrupt several inventors followed sturgeon in the development of dc motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues no electricity distribution had been developed at the time like sturgeons motor there was no practical commercial market for these motors14 in 1855 jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work511 he built a model electric vehicle that same year15 a major turning point in the development of dc machines took place in 1864 when antonio pacinotti described for the first time the ring armature with its symmetrically grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current1617 the first commercially successful dc motors followed the invention by znobe gramme who in 1871 reinvented pacinottis design in 1873 gramme showed that his dynamo could be used as a motor which he demonstrated to great effect at exhibitions in vienna and philadelphia by connecting two such dc motors at a distance of up to 2km away from each other one as a generator18 see also 1873 lexprience dcisive decisive workaround  in 1886 frank julian sprague invented the first practical dc motor a non-sparking motor that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads other sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution prior work done while employed by thomas edison allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole and provided controls systems for electric operations this allowed sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 188788 in richmond va the electric elevator and control system in 1892 and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars which were first installed in 1892 in chicago by the south side elevated railway where it became popularly known as the l spragues motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor which would become much more widespread the development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of a relatively small air gap between rotor and stator efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap19 a the st louis motor long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles is extremely inefficient for the same reason as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor20 application of electric motors revolutionized industry industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts belts compressed air or hydraulic pressure instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor providing easy control at the point of use and improving power transmission efficiency electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience comfort and safety possible today electric motors stand for more than half of the electric energy consumption in the us21 emergence of ac motorsedit in 1824 the french physicist franois arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields termed aragos rotations which by manually turning switches on and off walter baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor2223 2425 in the 1880s many inventors were trying to develop workable ac motors26 because acs advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on ac the first alternating-current commutatorless induction motors were independently invented by galileo ferraris and nikola tesla a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887 in 1888 the royal academy of science of turin published ferrariss research detailing the foundations of motor operation while however concluding that the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor25272829303132333435363738 in 1888 tesla presented his paper a new system for alternating current motors and transformers to the aiee that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited dc supply to rotor winding one of the patents tesla filed in 1887 however also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor george westinghouse promptly bought teslas patents employed tesla to develop them and assigned c f scott to help tesla however tesla left for other pursuits in 1889.2532353637383940414243444546 the constant speed ac induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars26 but westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in telluride colorado in 1891.474849 steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky invented the three-phase cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890 this type of motor is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications5051 however he claimed that teslas motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work52 although westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893 these early westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until b g lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor39 the general electric company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891.39 by 1896 general electric and westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design later called the squirrel-cage rotor39 induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100 horsepower hp induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5 hp motor in 1897.39 motor constructionedit electric motor rotor left and stator right rotoredit main article rotor electric in an electric motor the moving part is the rotor which turns the shaft to deliver the mechanical power the rotor usually has conductors laid into it which carry currents that interact with the magnetic field of the stator to generate the forces that turn the shaft however some rotors carry permanent magnets and the stator holds the conductors statoredit main article stator the stator is the stationary part of the motors electromagnetic circuit and usually consists of either windings or permanent magnets the stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets called laminations laminations are used to reduce energy losses that would result if a solid core were used air gapedit the distance between the rotor and stator is called the air gap the air gap has important effects and is generally as small as possible as a large gap has a strong negative effect on the performance of an electric motor it is the main source of the low power factor at which motors operatethe air gap increases the magnetizing current needed for this reason air gap should be minimum  very small gaps may pose mechanical problems in addition to noise and losses salient-pole rotor windingsedit main article windings windings are wires that are laid in coils usually wrapped around a laminated soft iron magnetic core so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current electric machines come in two basic magnet field pole configurations salient-pole machine and nonsalient-pole machine in the salient-pole machine the poles magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face in the nonsalient-pole or distributed field or round-rotor machine the winding is distributed in pole face slots53 a shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole some motors have conductors which consist of thicker metal such as bars or sheets of metal usually copper although sometimes aluminum is used these are usually powered by electromagnetic induction commutatoredit main article commutator electric a toys small dc motor with its commutator a commutator is a mechanism used to switch the input of most dc machines and certain ac machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated from each other and from the electric motors shaft the motors armature current is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole5455 in absence of such current reversal the motor would brake to a stop in light of significant advances in the past few decades due to improved technologies in electronic controller sensorless control induction motor and permanent magnet motor fields electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors motor supply and controledit motor supplyedit a dc motor is usually supplied through slip ring commutator as described above ac motors commutation can be either slip ring commutator or externally commutated type can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type and can be synchronous or asynchronous type universal motors can run on either ac or dc motor controledit fixed-speed controlled ac motors are provided with direct-on-line or soft-start starters variable speed controlled ac motors are provided with a range of different power inverter variable-frequency drive or electronic commutator technologies the term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated brushless dc motor and switched reluctance motor applications major categoriesedit electric motors operate on three different physical principles magnetic electrostatic and piezoelectric by far the most common is magnetic in magnetic motors magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator the product between these two fields gives rise to a force and thus a torque on the motor shaft one or both of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor this is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time or varying the strength of the pole the main types are dc motors and ac motors the former increasingly being displaced by the lattercitation needed ac electric motors are either asynchronous or synchronous once started a synchronous motor requires synchronism with the moving magnetic fields synchronous speed for all normal torque conditions in synchronous machines the magnetic field must be provided by means other than induction such as from separately excited windings or permanent magnets a fractional horsepower fhp motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower 0.746kw or is manufactured with a standard frame size smaller than a standard 1 hp motor many household and industrial motors are in the fractional horsepower class major categories

self-commutated motoredit brushed dc motoredit main article dc motor all self-commutated dc motors are by definition run on dc electric power most dc motors are small pm types they contain a brushed internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings current in synchronism with rotation64 electrically excited dc motoredit main article brushed dc electric motor workings of a brushed electric motor with a two-pole rotor and pm stator n and s designate polarities on the inside faces of the magnets the outside faces have opposite polarities a commutated dc motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an armature mounted on a rotating shaft the shaft also carries the commutator a long-lasting rotary electrical switch that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates thus every brushed dc motor has ac flowing through its rotating windings current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature the rotating armature consists of one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated magnetically soft ferromagnetic core current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature making it a temporary magnet an electromagnet the magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either pms or another winding a field coil as part of the motor frame the force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft the commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field so that the rotor never stops like a compass needle does but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied many of the limitations of the classic commutator dc motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator this creates friction sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections depending on the commutator design this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections and hence coil ends momentarily while crossing the gaps furthermore the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened increasing the sparking of the brushes this sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine as too-rapid sparking will overheat erode or even melt the commutator the current density per unit area of the brushes in combination with their resistivity limits the output of the motor the making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise sparking generates rfi brushes eventually wear out and require replacement and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance on larger motors or replacement on small motors the commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element requiring precision assembly of many parts on small motors the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor while most commutators are cylindrical some are flat discs consisting of several segments typically at least three mounted on an insulator large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking small brushes are also desirable for lower cost stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed but at the cost of greater friction losses lower efficiency and accelerated brush and commutator wear therefore dc motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power speed and efficiencywear dc machines are defined as follows65 armature circuit - a winding where the load current is carried such that can be either stationary or rotating part of motor or generator field circuit - a set of windings that produces a magnetic field so that the electromagnetic induction can take place in electric machines commutation a mechanical technique in which rectification can be achieved or from which dc can be derived in dc machines a shunt b series c compound f field coil there are five types of brushed dc motor- dc shunt-wound motor dc series-wound motor dc compound motor two configurations cumulative compound differentially compounded pm dc motor not shown separately excited not shown permanent magnet dc motoredit main article permanent-magnet electric motor a pm motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame instead relying on pms to provide the magnetic field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load because this field is fixed it cannot be adjusted for speed control pm fields stators are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding most larger dc motors are of the dynamo type which have stator windings historically pms could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled field windings were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux however large pms are costly as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble this favors wound fields for large machines to minimize overall weight and size miniature pm motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium or other strategic elements most such are neodymium-iron-boron alloy with their higher flux density electric machines with high-energy pms are at least competitive with all optimally designed singly-fed synchronous and induction electric machines miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration except that they have at least three rotor poles to ensure starting regardless of rotor position and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets electronic commutator ec motoredit brushless dc motoredit main article brushless dc electric motor some of the problems of the brushed dc motor are eliminated in the bldc design in this motor the mechanical rotating switch or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotors position bldc motors are typically 8590 efficient or more efficiency for a bldc motor of up to 96.5 have been reported66 whereas dc motors with brushgear are typically 7580 efficient the bldc motors characteristic trapezoidal back-emf waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed and partly from the placement of the rotors pms also known as electronically commutated dc or inside out dc motors the stator windings of trapezoidal bldc motors can be with single-phase two-phase or three-phase and use hall effect sensors mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost closed-loop control of the electronic commutator bldc motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary as in computer disk drives or in video cassette recorders the spindles within cd cd-rom etc drives and mechanisms within office products such as fans laser printers and photocopiers they have several advantages over conventional motors compared to ac fans using shaded-pole motors they are very efficient running much cooler than the equivalent ac motors this cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fans bearings without a commutator to wear out the life of a bldc motor can be significantly longer compared to a dc motor using brushes and a commutator commutation also tends to cause a great deal of electrical and rf noise without a commutator or brushes a bldc motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers the same hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can also provide a convenient tachometer signal for closed-loop control servo-controlled applications in fans the tachometer signal can be used to derive a fan ok signal as well as provide running speed feedback the motor can be easily synchronized to an internal or external clock leading to precise speed control bldc motors have no chance of sparking unlike brushed motors making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels also sparking generates ozone which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings risking harm to occupants health bldc motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to get rid of unwanted heat they are also acoustically very quiet motors which is an advantage if being used in equipment that is affected by vibrations modern bldc motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts larger bldc motors up to about 100kw rating are used in electric vehicles they also find significant use in high-performance electric model aircraft switched reluctance motoredit 64 pole switched reluctance motor main article switched reluctance motor the srm has no brushes or pms and the rotor has no electric currents instead torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field the magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic reluctance meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque as the rotor turns different windings will be energized keeping the rotor turning srms are now being used in some appliances67 universal ac-dc motoredit main article universal motor modern low-cost universal motor from a vacuum cleaner field windings are dark copper-colored toward the back on both sides the rotors laminated core is gray metallic with dark slots for winding the coils the commutator partly hidden has become dark from use it is toward the front the large brown molded-plastic piece in the foreground supports the brush guides and brushes both sides as well as the front motor bearing a commutated electrically excited series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on ac or dc power a universal motor can operate well on ac because the current in both the field and the armature coils and hence the resultant magnetic fields will alternate reverse polarity in synchronism and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation operating at normal power line frequencies universal motors are often found in a range less than 1000 watts universal motors also formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in electric railways in this application the use of ac to power a motor originally designed to run on dc would lead to efficiency losses due to eddy current heating of their magnetic components particularly the motor field pole-pieces that for dc would have used solid un-laminated iron and they are now rarely used an advantage of the universal motor is that ac supplies may be used on motors which have some characteristics more common in dc motors specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used the negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator such motors are used in devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently and often have high starting-torque demands multiple taps on the field coil provide imprecise stepped speed control household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified ac universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and as such are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines the motor can be used to agitate the drum both forwards and in reverse by switching the field winding with respect to the armature whereas scims cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency universal motors can run at much higher speeds this makes them useful for appliances such as blenders vacuum cleaners and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable they are also commonly used in portable power tools such as drills sanders circular and jig saws where the motors characteristics work well many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed 10,000 rpm while many similar miniature grinders exceed 30,000 rpm externally commutated ac machineedit main article ac motor the design of ac induction and synchronous motors is optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed application from the ac power grid or for variable-speed application from vfd controllers an ac motor has two parts a stationary stator having coils supplied with ac to produce a rotating magnetic field and a rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field induction motoredit main article induction motor large 4,500 hp ac induction motor cage and wound rotor induction motoredit an induction motor is an asynchronous ac motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction much like transformer action an induction motor resembles a rotating transformer because the stator stationary part is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor rotating part is the secondary side polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry induction motors may be further divided into squirrel cage induction motors and wound rotor induction motors scims have a heavy winding made up of solid bars usually aluminum or copper joined by rings at the ends of the rotor when one considers only the bars and rings as a whole they are much like an animals rotating exercise cage hence the name currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field the shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics at low speeds the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to be in the outer parts of the rotor cage as the motor accelerates the slip frequency becomes lower and more current is in the interior of the winding by shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit however the majority of such motors have uniform bars in a wrim the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft an external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit resistors allow control of the motor speed although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance a converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator the wrim is used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range by correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed this type of motor also offers controllable speed motor speed can be changed because the torque curve of the motor is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down if the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed the torque will be further reduced when used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal operated in this manner the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant the speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor torque motoredit main article torque motor a torque motor is a specialized form of electric motor which can operate indefinitely while stalled that is with the rotor blocked from turning without incurring damage in this mode of operation the motor will apply a steady torque to the load hence the name a common application of a torque motor would be the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive in this application driven from a low voltage the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension to be applied to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads driven from a higher voltage and so delivering a higher torque the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches in the computer gaming world torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels another common application is the control of the throttle of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with an electronic governor in this usage the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor the latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and depending on the speed makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor if the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed the current will be increased the motor will develop more torque pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle should the engine run too fast the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle synchronous motoredit main article synchronous motor a synchronous electric motor is an ac motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same rate as the ac and resulting magnetic field which drives it another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions contrast this with an induction motor which must slip to produce torque one type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a dc field slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor the rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor another type for low load torque has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles yet another such as made by hammond for its pre-world war ii clocks and in the older hammond organs has no rotor windings and discrete poles it is not self-starting the clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back while the older hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch finally hysteresis synchronous motors typically are essentially two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase they start like induction motors but when slip rate decreases sufficiently the rotor a smooth cylinder becomes temporarily magnetized its distributed poles make it act like a pmsm the rotor material like that of a common nail will stay magnetized but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty once running the rotor poles stay in place they do not drift low-power synchronous timing motors such as those for traditional electric clocks may have multi-pole pm external cup rotors and use shading coils to provide starting torque telechron clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor doubly-fed electric machineedit main article doubly-fed electric machine doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets which contribute active ie working power to the energy conversion process with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation two independent multiphase winding sets ie dual armature are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation this is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines which have only one active winding set a doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications68 special magnetic motorsedit rotaryedit ironless or coreless rotor motoredit a miniature coreless motor nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron steel portions of the rotor actually rotate if the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder then except for the effect of hysteresis torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless dc motor a specialized form of a pm dc motor64 optimized for rapid acceleration these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core the rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material the rotor can fit inside the stator magnets a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux a second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets in that design the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor and likewise provides a return path for the flux because the rotor is much lighter in weight mass than a conventional rotor formed from copper windings on steel laminations the rotor can accelerate much more rapidly often achieving a mechanical time constant under one ms this is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than the heavier copper but because there is no metal mass in the rotor to act as a heat sink even small coreless motors must often be cooled by forced air overheating might be an issue for coreless dc motor designs among these types are the disc-rotor types described in more detail in the next section vibrator motors for cellular phones are sometimes tiny cylindrical pm field types but there are also disc-shaped types which have a thin multipolar disc field magnet and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin pms these are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk hard disk drives although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers it is still loosely and incorrectly referred to as a voice coil structure because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker pancake or axial rotor motoredit a rather unusual motor design the printed armature or pancake motor has the windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets the magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor with space in between to form an axial air gap69 this design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its extremely flat profile although the technology has had many brand names since its inception such as servodisc the printed armature originally formed on a printed circuit board in a printed armature motor is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin rigid disc the printed armature has a unique construction in the brushed motor world in that it does not have a separate ring commutator the brushes run directly on the armature surface making the whole design very compact an alternative manufacturing method is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator in a flower and petal shape the windings are typically stabilized by being impregnated with electrical epoxy potting systems these are filled epoxies that have moderate mixed viscosity and a long gel time they are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm and are typically ul 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with 180c class h rating the unique advantage of ironless dc motors is that there is no cogging torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless although iron rotors are laminated this can greatly improve efficiency but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate 40khz or dc because of the decreased electromagnetic induction these motors were originally invented to drive the capstans of magnetic tape drives in the burgeoning computer industry where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical pancake motors are still widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems robotic systems industrial automation and medical devices due to the variety of constructions now available the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos servo motoredit main article servo motor a servomotor is a motor very often sold as a complete module which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves such as motor-operated control valves servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools pen plotters and other process systems motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed torque and power the speed vs torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop large powerful but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional ac or dc motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor as dynamic response requirements increase more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used ac motors superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of dc motors tends to favor pm synchronous bldc induction and srm drive applications69 a servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that the position feedback is continuous while the motor is running a stepper system relies on the motor not to miss steps for short term accuracy although a stepper system may include a home switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control70 for instance when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up its controller makes the print head stepper motor drive to its left-hand limit where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping as long as power is on a bidirectional counter in the printers microprocessor keeps track of print-head position stepper motoredit main article stepper motor a stepper motor with a soft iron rotor with active windings shown in a the active windings tend to hold the rotor in position in b a different set of windings are carrying a current which generates torque and rotation stepper motors are a type of motor frequently used when precise rotations are required in a stepper motor an internal rotor containing pms or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically a stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a dc electric motor and a rotary solenoid as each coil is energized in turn the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding unlike a synchronous motor in its application the stepper motor may not rotate continuously instead it stepsstarts and then quickly stops againfrom one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence depending on the sequence the rotor may turn forwards or backwards and it may change direction stop speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings leading the rotor to cog to a limited number of positions more sophisticated drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings allowing the rotors to position between the cog points and thereby rotate extremely smoothly this mode of operation is often called microstepping computer controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile forms of positioning systems particularly when part of a digital servo-controlled system stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease and hence stepper motors are used for readwrite head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives they were used for the same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the readwrite head of a hard disk drive as drive density increased the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drivesthe precision limitation made them unusable and the speed limitation made them uncompetitivethus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems the term voice coil in this connection is historic it refers to the structure in a typical cone type loudspeaker this structure was used for a while to position the heads modern drives have a pivoted coil mount the coil swings back and forth something like a blade of a rotating fan nevertheless like a voice coil modern actuator coil conductors the magnet wire move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers optical scanners and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element the print head carriage of dot matrix and inkjet printers and the platen or feed rollers likewise many computer plotters which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems so-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors they have one coil draw very little power and have a pm rotor the same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks some of these watches such as chronographs contain more than one stepping motor closely related in design to three-phase ac synchronous motors stepper motors and srms are classified as variable reluctance motor type71 stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers optical scanners and computer numerical control cnc machines such as routers plasma cutters and cnc lathes linear motoredit main article linear motor a linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been unrolled so that instead of producing a torque rotation it produces a straight-line force along its length linear motors are most commonly induction motors or stepper motors linear motors are commonly found in many roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail they are also used in maglev trains where the train flies over the ground on a smaller scale the 1978 era hp 7225a pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the x and y axes72 comparison by major categoriesedit comparison of motor types

march 2013 force and torqueedit the fundamental purpose of the vast majority of the worlds electric motors is to electromagnetically induce relative movement in an air gap between a stator and rotor to produce useful torque or linear force according to lorentz force law the force of a winding conductor can be given simply by f i b displaystyle mathbf f iboldsymbol ell times mathbf b  or more generally to handle conductors with any geometry f j b displaystyle mathbf f mathbf j times mathbf b the most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensors81 poweredit where rpm

air gap power is neglecting skin effect given by the following p a i r g a p r r s i r 2 displaystyle p_airgapfrac r_rsi_r2  where rr - rotor resistance ir2 - square of current induced in the rotor s - motor slip ie difference between synchronous speed and slip speed which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor back emfedit main article electromotive force since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field they have a voltage induced in them this voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called back electromotive force emf the voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor the back emf of the motor plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes must equal the voltage at the brushes this provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a dc motor if the mechanical load increases the motor slows down a lower back emf results and more current is drawn from the supply this increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load83 in ac machines it is sometimes useful to consider a back emf source within the machine this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on vfds for example83 lossesedit motor losses are mainly due to resistive losses in windings core losses and mechanical losses in bearings and aerodynamic losses particularly where cooling fans are present also occur losses also occur in commutation mechanical commutators spark and electronic commutators and also dissipate heat efficiencyedit to calculate a motors efficiency the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power p m p e displaystyle eta frac p_mp_e  where displaystyle eta is energy conversion efficiency p e displaystyle p_e is electrical input power and p m displaystyle p_m is mechanical output power p e i v displaystyle p_eiv p m t displaystyle p_mtomega where v

electric circuits displaystyle mu is the permeability of the core displaystyle omega is the angular frequency the motor is driven at from this he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles however the equation only directly relates to non pm motors performance parametersedit torque capability of motor typesedit this section only describes one highly specialized aspect of its associated subject please help improve this article by adding more general information the talk page may contain suggestions march 2012 all the electromagnetic motors and that includes the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields for calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap  once these have been established by mathematical analysis using fea or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector the current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current this makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed once this is done a figure relating the current to the torque can be used as a useful parameter for motor selection the maximum torque for a motor will depend on the maximum current although this will usually be only usable until thermal considerations take precedence when optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current ie torque current voltage pole-pair number excitation frequency ie synchronous speed and air-gap flux density all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque ie operating torque within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators capacity for bursts of torque should not be confused with field weakening capability field weakening allows an electric machine to operate beyond the designed frequency of excitation field weakening is done when the maximum speed cannot be reached by increasing the applied voltage this applies to only motors with current controlled fields and therefore cannot be achieved with pm motors electric machines without a transformer circuit topology such as that of wrsms or pmsms cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the magnetic core and rendering any increase in current as useless furthermore the pm assembly of pmsms can be irreparably damaged if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted electric machines with a transformer circuit topology such as induction machines induction doubly-fed electric machines and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed wrdf machines exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density which would otherwise lead to core saturation electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases which limits the magnitude of active ie real current still bursts of torque that are two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable the brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed bwrsdf machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology ie both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port86 the dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set if a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set the active current of the bwrsdf machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated continuous torque densityedit the continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set the speed of the machine and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt pms continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible period of operation before destruction by overheating of windings or pm damage continuous power densityedit the continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range of the electric machine standardsedit

the attraction and repulsion of electric charge usually electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors they typically require a high-voltage power supply although very small motors employ lower voltages conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion and require high current at low voltages in the 1750s the first electrostatic motors were developed by benjamin franklin and andrew gordon today the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems mems where their drive voltages are below 100 volts and where moving charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores also the molecular machinery which runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motorscitation needed a piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a piezoelectric material when an electric field is applied piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations in order to produce a linear or rotary motion in one mechanism the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds similar to the way a caterpillar movescitation needed an electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel

in this context seen as a function of degree of ecm drive complexity with bldc drives typically being with simple single-phase scalar-controlled voltage-regulated trapezoidal current waveform output involving surface pm motor construction and blac drives tending towards more complex three-phase vector-controlled current-regulated sinusoidal waveform involving interior pm motor construction61 the
