denmark was a pioneer in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s and today a substantial share of the wind turbines around the world are produced by danish manufacturers such as vestas and siemens wind power along with many component suppliers wind power produced the equivalent of 42.1 of denmarks total electricity consumption in 2015,12 increased from 33 in 2013 and 39 in 2014.345 in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50 by 2020,6 and to 84 in 2035.7 denmark had the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014.8

warming grew in the 1980s denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita primarily due to the coal-fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises11 renewable energy became the natural choice for denmark decreasing both dependence on other countries for energy and global warming pollution many countries tried to subsidize green technology such as wind power and most failed to make a viable industry the danish system was an exception providing 30 of initial capital cost in the early years which was gradually reduced to zero but still maintaining a feed-in tariff12 the capital cost subsidy was reduced to 20 in june 1985 when wind turbines received dkk 50 million per year other renewable energy forms received 37 million13 the research institution teknologisk institut identified many specific improvement needs pushing development from ad hoc to systemized solutions14 on 29 march 1985 one year before the chernobyl disaster the danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants in the process the danish grassroots movement had a substantial role the danish anti-nuclear movements ooa smiling-sun logo atomkraft nej tak nuclear power no thanks spread worldwide and the renewable alternatives were promoted by the danish organisation for renewable energy ove denmark adopted a target of cutting carbon emissions by 22 from 1988 levels by 2005.11 planning of wind power was deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles15 wind resourcesedit external images wind map

weeks of power system data denmark has relatively modest average wind speeds in the range of 4.95.6ms measured at 10m height onshore wind resources are highest in the western part of the country and on the eastern islands with coastlines facing south or west the country has very large offshore wind resources and large areas of sea territory with a shallow water depth of 515m where siting is most feasible these sites offer higher wind speeds in the range of roughly 8.59.0ms at 50m height16 there have been no major problems from wind variability although there is a temporary problem resulting from the connection of a large bloc of wind power from offshore wind farms to a single point on a weak section of the transmission network17 the wind resource over denmark was mapped in 1999 by emd international as and ris national laboratory the mapping was made using a 200m grid resolution using the models in windpro and wasp the results were validated on more than 1200 wind turbines nationwide18 denmark is connected by transmission line to other european countries eg cross-skagerrak19 at an electricity interconnection level transmission capacity relative to production capacity of 44.20 denmark has also retained its traditional power plants therefore it does not need to install additional peak-load plants to balance its wind power instead it purchases additional power from its neighbours when necessary with some strengthening of the grid denmark plans to increase winds share even further21 to 50 of consumption in 2020,22 and up to 84 in 2035.7 analysts expect the cost of wind power to be 30 rekwh and its handling cost to be 15 rekwh being lower than coal and natural gas at 55 rekwh minimum23 due to their inability to follow load wind power gets a lower price24 consumption related to wind poweredit danish district heating plants use 100 petajouleyear25 but little of this consumption is from 180mw of electrode boilers installed in powerplants or 37mw of large heat pumps the boilers are only used to soak up the powerplants own electricity when prices are negative to avoid paying tax26272829 expansion of wind powered district heating is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes303132 the number of household heat pumps has stalled at 70,000 in 2015 due to tax-free wood pellets and the goal of 300,000 small heat pumps in 2035 is unlikely to be reached reducing the value of more wind power unless electricity tax is reduced33 capacities and productionedit wind power in denmark external image grid stability and wind share at the end of

situation was unclear61 onshoreedit in addition to the offshore projects a further 500mw additional net capacity of onshore windfarms is expected be constructed until 2020 the 500mw of additional net capacity is the expected result of the scrapping of 1,300mw capacity from obsolete wind turbines combined with the simultaneous building of 1,800mw capacity of modern wind turbines - a process also known as repowering62 electricity exports from denmarkedit annual wind power production is currently 2014 equal to about 39 of electricity consumed in denmark23 the proportion of this that is actually consumed in denmark has been disputed as the considerable hydropower resources of norway and to some extent sweden is used as grid storage with low loss hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power saving water for later and can export electricity to denmark when wind power output drops short term denmark imports electricity from norway during daytime and exports in nighttime long term denmark imports electricity in summer and exports in winter wind is higher in autumn and winter when consumption is also high63 this service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found around the world in pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants for timeshifting trade with norway denmark exports at dkk 157mwh and imports at dkk 212mwh.32 the correlation is low between wind power in norway and denmark63 market price sometimes falls to near or below zero particularly in high winds and low consumption64 in 2014 there were 46 hours with negative prices costing dkk 37.7 million65 in 2015 negative prices occurred in 65 hours in west denmark and 36 hours in east denmark - less than 1 of the time danish prices are mainly negative when german prices are even more negative the whole date of september 2 2015 was the first time that no central power plants were running in west denmark and grid stability was maintained by compensators2 denmark is generally a transit country for electricity trade between the much larger markets in norway sweden and germany6667 and plans to add cables to the netherlands cobracable and england viking link as well further increasing the function of being a crossroads for electricity claims of up to 40 of wind power being exported have been made6869 countered by claims that only 1 was exported70 according to the first argument power in excess of immediate demand is exported to neighbouring countries at lower prices part of the benefit of this goes to denmarks northern neighbours when denmark exports power it is sold at the spot market price which must be lower than at the importing market in order to be transmitted according to the second argument the correlation between exports and wind power is weak and a similar correlation exists with conventional thermal plants running partly for district heating meanwhile causal analysis shows that export from denmark typically occurs as a consequence of the merit order effect when large thermal plants have reserve capacities at times the spot market price of electricity is high in any case the export price is the intermediate between the prices of the two areas so the exporting tso energinet uses the profit to relieve tariffs71 at around dkk 500 million per year72 wind power organizations state that denmark exports power at a higher price than it imports at73 economic conditionsedit wind turbine industryedit a vestas wind turbine the danish wind turbine industry is the worlds largest around 90 of the national output is exported and danish companies accounted for 38 of the world turbine market in 2003 when the industry employed some 20,000 people and had a turnover of around 3billion euro74 the return of investment dropped from near 20 before the financial crisis to 10 some years later7576 the danish wind turbine industry had a turnover of dkk 84 billion in 2014.77 the biggest wind turbine manufacturers with production facilities in denmark are vestas and siemens wind power the development of wind power in denmark has been characterized by a close collaboration between publicly financed research and industry in key areas such as research and development certification testing and the preparation of standards78 for example in the 1980s a large number of small danish companies were developing wind turbines to sell to california and the danish ris laboratory provided test facilities and certification procedures these resulted in reliable products and the rapid expansion of the danish turbine manufacturing industry79 components are tested at lorc in odense and new large prototype turbines between 4-8 mw including some non-danish ones are being tested at sterild limited

variability slightly91 criticism in 2009 the institute for energy research commissioned the danish think-tank cepos centre for political studies to report on electricity exports from denmark and the economic impact of the danish wind industry this heavily criticized report92 states that danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the european union mostly for government revenue but partly to subsidize wind power and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 dkk 87 us124 it also estimated that 90 of wind industry jobs were transferred

- 480m yearly in 2001-2005 the report was later heavily criticised firstly danish engineering magazine ingeniren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the american oil and coal lobby

wind turbine cooperative to encourage investment in wind power families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining municipality98 while this could involve purchasing a turbine outright more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines by 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country98 opinion polls show that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines with some 86 of danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources74 the role of wind turbine cooperatives is not limited to single turbines the middelgrunden offshore wind farm with 20turbines the worlds largest offshore farm at the time it was built in 2000

to wind turbine cooperatives which had installed 86 of all the wind turbines in denmark100 by 2004 over 150,000 were either members or owned turbines and about 5,500 turbines had been installed although with greater private sector involvement the proportion owned by cooperatives had fallen to 75.74 the cooperative model has also spread to germany and the netherlands sams islandedit the
