it has been suggested that water security and emergency preparedness be merged into this article discuss proposed since july 2014 a 2012 map of the world showing in red the places with least water security water security has been defined as the reliable availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health livelihoods and production coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks1 sustainable development will not be achieved without a water secure world a water secure world integrates a concern for the intrinsic value of water with a concern for its use for human survival and well-being a water secure world harnesses waters productive power and minimises its destructive force water security also means addressing environmental protection and the negative effects of poor management it is also concerned with ending fragmented responsibility for water and integrating water resources management across all sectors finance planning agriculture energy tourism industry education and health a water secure world reduces poverty advances education and increases living standards it is a world where there is an improved quality of life for all especially for the most vulnerableusually women and childrenwho benefit most from good water governance2 contents 1 background 2 fresh water 3 research 4 most affected countries 5 international competition 6

availability and quality access to vital minerals coastal and island flooding and more among the consequences of these impacts will be challenges to political relationships realignment of energy markets and regional economies and threats to security3 it impacts regions states and countries tensions exist between upstream and downstream users of water within individual jurisdictions4 during history there has been much conflict over use of water from rivers such as the tigris and euphrates rivers5 another highly politicized example is israels control of water resources in the levant region since its creation6 where israel securing its water resources was one of several drivers for the 1967 six day war water security is sometimes sought by implementing water desalination pipelines between sources and users water licences with different security levels and war water allocation between competing users is increasingly determined by application of market-based pricing for either water licenses or actual water7 fresh wateredit water in absolute terms is not in short supply planet-wide but according to the united nations water organization un-water the total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans is only about 200,000 km3 of water less than one percent 1 of all freshwater resources and water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population increase in the last century specifically water withdrawals are predicted to increase by 50 percent by 2025 in developing countries and 18 per cent in developed countries by 2025 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions8 researchedit thailand nan river fishing according to nature 2010 about 80 of the worlds population 5.6 billion in 2011 live in areas with threats to water security the water security is a shared threat to human and nature and it is pandemic human water-management strategies can be detrimental to wildlife such as migrating fish regions with intensive agriculture and dense populations such as the us and europe have a high threat of water security water is increasingly being used as a weapon in conflict9 water insecurity is always accompanied by one or more issues such as poverty war and conflict low womens development and environmental degradation10 researchers estimate that during 2010-2015 ca us800 billion will be required to cover the annual global investment in water infrastructure good management of water resources can jointly manage biodiversity protection and human water security preserving flood plains rather than constructing flood-control reservoirs would provide a cost-effective way to control floods while protecting the biodiversity of wildlife that occupies such areas11 lawrence smith the president of the population institute asserts that although an overwhelming majority of the planets surface is composed of water 97 of this water is constituted of saltwater the fresh water used to sustain humans is only 3 of the total amount of water on earth12 therefore smith believes that the competition for water in an overpopulated world would pose a major threat to human stability12 even going so far as to postulate apocalyptic world wars being fought over the control of thinning ice sheets and nearly desiccated reservoirs12 nevertheless 2 billion people have supposedly gained access to a safe water source since 1990 who may have earlier lacked it13 the proportion of people in developing countries with access to safe water is calculated to have improved from 30 percent in 197014 to 71 percent in 1990 79 percent in 2000 and 84 percent in 2004 parallel with rising population this trend is projected to continue13 the earth has a limited though renewable supply of fresh water stored in aquifers surface waters and the atmosphere oceans are a good source of usable water but the amount of energy needed to convert saline water to potable water is prohibitive with conventional approaches explaining why only a very small fraction of the worlds water supply is derived from desalination15 however modern technologies such as the seawater greenhouse use solar energy to desalinate seawater for agriculture and drinking uses in an extremely cost-effective manner most affected countriesedit communal tap standpost for drinking water in soweto johannesburg south africa based on the map published by the consultative group on international agricultural research cgiar16 the

the darling river system between queensland new south wales and south australia in victoria australia a proposed pipeline from the goulburn valley to melbourne has led to protests by farmers21 in the macquarie marshes of nsw grazing and irrigation interests compete for water flowing to the marshes the snowy mountains scheme diverted water from the snowy river to the murray river and the murrumbidgee river for the benefit of irrigators and electricity generation through hydro-electric power during recent years government has taken action to increase environmental flows to the snowy in spite of severe drought in the murray darling basin the australian government has implemented buy-backs of water allocations or properties with water allocations to endeavour to increase environmental flows indiaedit main articles water supply and sanitation in india pollution of the ganges and energy policy of india in india there is competition for water resources of all inter state rivers except the main brahmaputra river among the riparian states of india and also with neighbouring countries which are nepal china pakistan bhutan bangladesh etc22 vast area of the indian subcontinent is under tropical climate which is conducive for agriculture due to favourable warm and sunny conditions provided perennial water supply is available to cater to the high rate of evapotranspiration from the cultivated land though the overall water resources are adequate to meet all the requirements of the subcontinent the water supply gaps due to temporal and spatial distribution of water resources among the states and countries in the subcontinent are to be bridged there is intense competition for the water available in the inter state rivers such as kavery krishna godavari vamsadhara mandovi ravi-beas-sutlez narmada tapti mahanadi etc among the riparian states of india in the absence of water augmentation from the water surplus rivers such as brahmaputra himalayan tributaries of ganga and west flowing coastal rivers of western ghats all river basins face severe water shortage even for drinking needs of people cattle and wild life during the intense summer season when the rainfall is negligible water security can be achieved along with energy security as it is going to consume electricity to link the surplus water areas with the water deficit areas by lift canals pipe lines etc23 the total water resources going waste to the sea are nearly 1200 billion cubic meters after sparing moderate environmental salt export water requirements of all rivers24 interlinking rivers of the subcontinent is possible to achieve water security in the indian subcontinent with the active cooperation of the countries in the region blue peaceedit us navy seabees tapping an artesian well in helmand province afghanistan blue peace is a method which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation this unique approach to turn tensions around water into opportunities for socio-economic development was developed by strategic foresight group in partnership with the governments of switzerland and sweden the blue peace is an innovative approach to engage

general assembly conventional fossil or nuclear energy based desalinationedit due to record low rainfall in summer 2005 the reservoir behind sameura dam runs low the reservoir supplies water to takamatsu shikoku island japan as new technological innovations continue to reduce the capital cost of desalination more countries are building desalination plants as a small element in addressing their water crises25 israel desalinizes water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter 26 singapore desalinizes water for 49 cents per cubic meter 27 and also treats sewage with reverse osmosis for industrial and potable use newater china and india the worlds two most populous countries are turning to desalination to provide a small part of their water needs 2829 in 2007 pakistan announced plans to use desalination 30 all australian capital cities except darwin northern territory and hobart are either in the process of building desalination plants or are already using them in late 2011 melbourne will begin using australias largest desalination plant the wonthaggi desalination plant to raise low reservoir levels in 2007 bermuda signed a contract to purchase a desalination plant 31 the largest desalination plant in the united states is the one at tampa bay florida which began desalinizing 25 million gallons 95000 m of water per day in december 2007.32 in the united states the cost of desalination is 3.06 for 1,000 gallons or 81 cents per cubic meter33 in the united states california arizona texas and florida use desalination for a very small part of their water supply343536 after being desalinized at jubail saudi arabia water is pumped 200 miles 320km inland though a pipeline to the capital city of riyadh37 a january 17 2008 article in the wall street journal states world-wide 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day according to the international desalination association 38 the worlds largest desalination plant is the jebel ali desalination plant phase 2 in the united arab emirates it is a dual-purpose facility that uses multi-stage flash distillation and is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year39 a typical aircraft carrier in the us military uses nuclear power to desalinize 400,000 us gallons 1,500,000l of water per day40 while desalinizing 1,000 us gallons 3,800l of water can cost as much as 3 the same amount of bottled water costs 7,945.41 however given the energy intensive nature of desalination with associated economic and environmental costs desalination is generally considered a last resort after water conservation but this is changing as prices continue to fall according to msnbc a report by lux research estimated that the worldwide desalinated water supply will triple between 2008 and 2020.42 however not everyone is convinced that desalination is or will be economically viable or environmentally sustainable for the foreseeable future debbie cook the former mayor of huntington beach california has been a frequent critic of desalination proposals ever since she was appointed as a member of the california desalination task force cook claims that in addition to being energy intensive desalination schemes are very costlyoften much more costly than desalination proponents claim in her writing on the subject cook points to a long list of projects that have stalled or been aborted for financial or other reasons and suggests that water-stressed regions would do better to focus on conservation or other water supply solutions than to invest in desalination plants43 solar energy based desalinationedit a novel approach to desalination is the seawater greenhouse which takes seawater and uses solar energy to desalinate it in conjunction with
