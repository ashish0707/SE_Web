envirotech redirects here for the singapore-based company see united envirotech for the california-based company see envirotech company cleantech sustainable urban design and innovation photovoltaic ombrire sudi is an autonomous and mobile station that replenishes energy for electric vehicles using solar energy environmental technology envirotech green technology greentech or clean technology cleantech is the application of one or more of environmental science green chemistry environmental monitoring and electronic devices to monitor model and conserve the natural environment and resources and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement the term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics wind turbines bioreactors etc sustainable development is the core of environmental technologies the term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources

photovoltaic thermal depolymerization composting toilet pyrolysis main article recycling renewable energyedit a view across a reverse osmosis desalination plant in nepal renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily for years we have been using sources like wood sun water etc for means for producing energy energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood sun wind etc is considered to be renewable water purificationedit water purification the whole ideaconcept of having dirtgermpollution free water flowing throughout the environment many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water water pollution is the main enemy of this concept and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water1 air purificationedit air purification basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove co2 and convert it into oxygen the best examples are dypsis lutescens sansevieria trifasciata and epipremnum aureum2 sewage treatmentedit sewage treatment is conceptually similar to water purification sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution the most polluted water is not used for anything and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently it may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection sustainability etc3 environmental remediationedit environmental remediation is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment this is accomplished by various chemical biological and bulk movements encyclopedia of medical concepts4 solid waste managementedit net zero court zero emissions office building prototype in st louis missouri solid waste management is the purification consumption reuse disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a citytown5 egain forecastingedit egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weathers impact on a building6 by adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast the system eliminates redundant use of heat thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases7 energy conservationedit energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity alternative and clean poweredit the tesla roadster was the first all-electric sports car for sale and in serial production it can be plugged into conventional outlets and can be charged fully or partially on renewable energy including solar hydroelectric geothermal or wind power principles green syndicalism sustainability sustainable design sustainable engineering scientists continue to search for clean energy alternatives to our current power production methods some technologies such as anaerobic digestion produce renewable energy from waste materials the global reduction of greenhouse gases is dependent on the adoption of energy conservation technologies at industrial level as well as this clean energy generation that includes using unleaded gasoline solar energy and alternative fuel vehicles including plug-in hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles since industrial use of energy accounts for 51 of worldwide energy usage8 improving energy efficiency in this field is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe advanced energy efficient electric motor and electric generator technology that are cost effective to encourage their application such as the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine and energy saving module can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co2 and sulfur dioxide so2 that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere if electricity is generated using fossil fuels greasestock is an event held yearly in yorktown heights new york which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the united states910111213 there are more chemical formula like this for example reaction on water in nitric acid there are things made on heat process like iron steel zinc etc it also may be reversed making things on freezing or cooling process like cement and water reaction make strong chemical molecules or glue or super glue on heat they do not melt but iron steel and zinc melt on heat so super glue like chemical formula with more chemical work will be so strong if it will be processed from high cool temperature minus temperature 14 educationedit courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes environmental engineering or environmental systems courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment environmental chemistry sustainable chemistry or environmental chemical engineering courses oriented towards understanding the effects good and bad of chemicals in the environment such awards can focus on mining processes pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes environmental technology courses oriented towards producing electronic electrical or electrotechnology graduates capable of developing devices and artefacts able to monitor measure model and control environmental impact including monitoring and managing energy
