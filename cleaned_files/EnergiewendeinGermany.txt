photovoltaic array and wind turbines at the schneebergerhof wind farm in the german state of rheinland-pfalz market share of germanys power generation 20141 the energiewende german for energy transition is the transition by germany to a low carbon environmentally sound reliable and affordable energy supply2 the new system will rely heavily on renewable energy particularly wind photovoltaics and biomass energy efficiency and energy demand management most if not all existing coal-fired generation will need to be retired3 the phase-out of germanys fleet of nuclear reactors to be complete by 2022 is a key part of the program4 legislative support for the energiewende was passed in late 2010 and includes greenhouse gas ghg reductions of 8095 by 2050 relative to 1990 and a renewable energy target of 60 by 2050.5 these targets are ambitious6 one berlin policy institute noted that while the german approach is not unique worldwide the speed and scope of the energiewende are exceptional7 the energiewende also seeks a greater transparency in relation to national energy policy formation8 germany has made significant progress on its ghg emissions reduction target achieving a 27 decrease between 1990 and 2014 however germany will need to maintain an average ghg emissions abatement rate of 3.5 per annum to reach its energiewende goal equal to the maximum historical value thus far9 germany spends 1.5billion per annum on energy research 2013 figure in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition10 this includes a number of computer studies that have confirmed the feasibility and a similar cost relative to business-as-usual and given that carbon is adequately priced of the energiewende the term energiewende is regularly

energiewende was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the german ko-institut calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy1213223 on 16 february 1980 the german federal ministry of the environment also hosted a symposium in berlin called energiewende atomausstieg und klimaschutz energy transition nuclear phase-out and climate protection the views of the ko-institut initially strongly opposed have gradually become common knowledge in energy policy in the following decades the term expanded in scope in its present form it dates back to at least 2002 energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency in a broader sense this transition also entails a democratization of energy14 in the traditional energy industry a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power renewable energies in contrast can as a rule be established in a decentralized manner public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production15 photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders also significant the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy and local governments often promote them statusedit the key policy document outlining the energiewende was published by the german government in september 2010 some six months before the fukushima nuclear accident2 legislative support was passed in september 2010 on 6 june 2011 following fukushima the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy16 after the 2013 federal elections the new cducsu and spd coalition government continued the energiewende with only minor modification of its targets in the coalition agreement17 important aspects include as of november 2015 energiewende policy targets with actual figures for 201454 target

legislation in 2016 is available18 these targets go well beyond european union legislation and the national policies of other european states the policy objectives have been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5 in 1999 to 22.9 in 2012 surpassing the oecd average of 18 usage of renewables19 producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years guaranteeing a fixed income energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market however in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low returns and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality20 nuclear power plants were closed and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned in 2022 one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market it is believed 8,300km of power lines must be built or upgraded19 the different german states have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers who have had rising electricity bills germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe21 in comparison their nuclear-reliant neighbour france has some of the cheapest in the eu 7 out of 27 acceptance of power plants in the neighborhood germany 201422 according to a 2014 survey conducted by tns emnid for the german renewable energies agency among 1015 respondents 94 per cent of the germans support the enforced expansion of renewable energies more than two-thirds of the interviewees agree to renewable power plants close to their homes23 the share of total final energy from renewables was 11 in 2014.24137 on 1 august 2014 a revised renewable energy sources act entered into force specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates feed-in tariffs will no longer be fixed by the government but will be determined by auction25 market redesign is a key part of the energiewende the german electricity market needs to be reworked to suit26 among other things wind and pv cannot be principally refinanced under the current marginal cost based market carbon pricing is also central to the energiewende and the european union emissions trading scheme eu ets needs to be reformed to create a genuine scarcity of certificates27 the german federal government is calling for such reform25 most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the energiewende rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the energiewende some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out28 coal comprised 42 of electricity generation in 2015 if germany is to limit its contribution to a global temperature increase to 1.5c above pre-industrial levels as declared in the 2015 paris agreement a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to 100 renewable energy is required by about 2040.29 the energiewende is made up of various technical building blocks electricity storage while too expensive at present may become a useful technology in the future3031 energy efficiency has a key but currently under-recognised role to play32 improved energy efficiency is one of germanys official targets greater integration with adjoining national electricity networks can offer mutual benefits indeed systems with high shares of renewables can utilize geographical diversity to offset intermittency33 germany invested 1.5billion in energy research in 2013.34 of that the german federal government spent 820million supporting projects ranging from basic research to applications25 the federal government also foresees an export role for german expertise in the area25 the social and political dimensions of the energiewende have been subject to study strunz argues that the underlying technological political and economic structures will need to change radically a process he calls regime shift35 schmid knopf and pechan analyse the actors and institutions that will be decisive in the energiewende and how latency in the national electricity infrastructure may restrict progress36 on 3 december 2014 the german federal government released its national action plan on energy efficiency nape in order to improve the uptake of energy efficiency3738 the areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings energy conservation for companies consumer energy efficiency and transport energy efficiency german industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution an official federal government report on progress under the energiewende updated for 2014 notes that5 energy consumption fell by 4.7 in 2014 from 2013 and at 700413132000000000013132petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990 renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6 between 2008 and 2014 final energy consumption in the transport sector was 1.7 higher in 2014 than in 2005 for the first time in more than ten years electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015 a commentary on the progress report expands on many of the issues raised39 slow progress on transmission network reinforcement has led to a deferment of new windfarms in northern germany40 the german cabinet earlier approved costly underground cabling in october 2015 in a bid to dispel local resistance against above-ground pylons and to speed up the expansion process41 citizen support and participationedit as of 2016update citizen support for the energiewende remains high with recent surveys indicating that about 8090 of the public are in favor42 one reason for the high acceptance is the substantial participation of german citizens in the energiewende as private households land owners or members of energy cooperatives genossenschaft43 a 2016 survey showed that roughly one in two germans would consider investing in community renewable energy projects44 manfred fischedick director of the wuppertal institute for climate environment and energy has commented that if people participate with their own money for example in a wind or solar power plant in their area they will also support the energiewende43 a 2010 study shows the benefits to municipalities of community ownership of renewable generation in their locality45 estimates for 2012 suggest that almost half the renewable energy capacity in germany is owned by citizens through energy cooperatives and private initiatives46 more specifically citizens account for nearly half of all installed biogas and solar capacity and half of the installed onshore wind capacity4347 changes in energy policy starting with the renewable energy sources act in 2014 may jeopardize the efforts of citizens to participate in the future4348 computer studiesedit much of the policy development for the energiewende is underpinned by computer models run mostly by universities and research institutes the models are usually based on scenario analysis and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability sustainability cost efficiency and public acceptability of various sets of technologies some models cover the entire energy sector while others are confined to electricity generation and consumption several computer studies confirm the feasibility of the german electricity system being 100 renewable in 2050 2009 wwf studyedit in 2009 wwf germany published a quantitative study prepared by the ko-institut prognos and hans-joachim ziesing49 the study presumes a 95 reduction in greenhouse gases by the year 2050 and covers all sectors the study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and affordable it notes that by committing to this transformation path germany could become a model for other countries 2015 deep decarbonization pathways project studyedit the deep decarbonization pathways project ddpp aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a low-carbon economy the 2015 german country report produced in association with the wuppertal institute examines the official target of reducing domestic ghg emissions by 80 to 95 by 2050 compared with 1990.50 decarbonization pathways for germany are illustrated by means of three ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80 and more than 90 three strategies strongly contribute to ghg emission reduction energy efficiency improvements in all sectors but especially in buildings increased use of domestic renewables with a focus on electricity generation electrification and in two of the scenarios also use of renewable electricity-based synthetic fuels especially in the transport and industry sector in addition some scenarios use controversially final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes modal shift in transport changes in eating and heating habits net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of bioenergy use of carbon capture and storage ccs technology to reduce industry sector ghg emissions including cement production potential co-benefits for germany include increased energy security higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies job creation stronger gdp growth smaller energy bills for households and less air pollution 2015 fraunhofer ise studyedit using the model remod-d renewable energy model germany51 this 2015 fraunhofer ise study investigates several system transformation scenarios and their related costs52 the guiding question of the study is how can a cost-optimised transformation of the german energy system with consideration of all energy carriers and consumer sectors be achieved while meeting the declared climate protection targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times carbon capture and storage ccs is explicitly excluded from the scenarios a future energy scenario emitting 85 less co2 emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario which assumes that the german energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today under this comparison primary energy supply drops 42 the total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil if the penalty for co2 emissions increases to 100tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2 then the total cumulative costs of todays energy system are 8 higher than the costs required for the minus 85 scenario up to 2050 the report also notes from the macroeconomic perspective the transformation of germanys energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems their operation and maintenance in this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis p8 2015 diw studyedit a 2015 study uses dieter or dispatch and investment evaluation tool with endogenous renewables developed by the german institute for economic research diw berlin germany the study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60 to 100 under the baseline scenario of 80 the german government target for 2050 grid storage requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options particularly on biomass availability the model is fully described in the study report53 2016 acatech studyedit a 2016 acatech-lead study focused on so-called flexibility technologies used to balance the fluctuations inherent in power generation from wind and photovoltaics5455 set in 2050 several scenarios use gas power plants to stabilise the backbone of energy system ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation other scenarios investigate a 100 renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly flexible consumption and storage control demand-side management in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations long-term storage systems based on power-to-x are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80 on the question of costs the study notes assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will as a rule come cheaper than a system dominated by fossil fuel power plants547 2016 stanford university studyedit the atmosphereenergy program at stanford university has developed roadmaps for 139 countries to achieve energy systems powered only by wind water and sunlight wws by 2050.5657 in the case of germany total end-use energy drops from 375.8gw for business-as-usual to 260.9gw under a fully renewable transition load shares

study also assess avoided air pollution eliminated global climate change costs and net job creation these co-benefits are substantial criticismsedit the energiewende has not been without its critics after introduction of the original renewable energy sources act in 2000 there was a focus on long term costs while in later years this has shifted to a focus on short term costs and the financial burden of the energiewende while ignoring environmental externalities of fossil fuels58 nonetheless for the first time in more than ten years electricity prices for household customers fell at the beginning of 2015.5 components of the german electricity price for households in 201659 the renewable energy levy to finance green power investment is added to germans electricity unit price the surcharge 22.1 in 2016 pays the state-guaranteed price for renewable energy to producers and is 6.35 cents per kwh in 2016.60 german economy and energy minister sigmar gabriel admitted for a country like germany with a strong industrial base exiting nuclear and coal-fired power generation at the same time would not be possible6162 germanys co2 emissions were escalating in 2012 and 2013 and it is planned to reopen some of the dirtiest brown coal mines that had previously been closed coal generated electricity increased to 45 in 2013 the highest level since 2007.63 nonetheless in 2014 carbon emissions had declined again more renewable energy had been generated and a greater energy efficiency had been achieved60 from 1999 to 2014 renewable energy production rose from 29 twh to 161 twh while nuclear power fell from 180 to 97 twh and coal power production fell from 291 to 265 twh58 reception by other countriesedit united statesedit robert fares states two lessons to be learned from
