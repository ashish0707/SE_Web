ecological philosophy is a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium the term was coined by the norwegian father of deep ecology arne nss and french post-marxist philosopher and psychoanalyst flix guattari contents 1 nsss definition 2 flix guattari 3 see also 4 notes 5 references 6 external links nsss definitionedit naess defined ecosophy in the following way by an ecosophy i mean a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium a philosophy as a kind of sofia or wisdom is openly normative it contains both norms rules postulates value priority announcements and hypotheses concerning the state of affairs in our universe wisdom is policy wisdom prescription not only scientific description and prediction the details of an ecosophy will show many variations due to significant differences concerning not only the facts of pollution resources population etc but also value priorities a drengson and y inoue 1995 page 8 while a professor at university of oslo in 1972 arne nss introduced the terms deep ecology movement and ecosophy into environmental literature naess based his article on a talk he gave in bucharest in 1972 at the third world future research conference as drengson notes in ecophilosophy ecosophy and the deep ecology movement an overview in his talk nss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for nature and the inherent worth of other beings naesss view of humans as an integral part of a total-field image1 of nature contrasts with the alternative and more anthropocentric construction of ecosophy outlined by guattari the term ecological wisdom synonymous with ecosophy was introduced by nss in 1973 the concept has become one of the foundations of the deep ecology movement all expressions of values by green parties list ecological wisdom as a key valueit was one of the original four pillars of the green party and is often considered the most basic value of these parties it is also often associated with indigenous religion and cultural practices in its political context it is necessarily not as easily defined as ecological health or scientific ecology concepts flix guattariedit ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by psychoanalyst poststructuralist philosopher and political activist flix guattari in part guattaris use of the term demarcates what he observes as the necessity for the proponents of social liberation whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution and marxism to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through its maintenance of the dualistic separation of human cultural and nonhuman natural systems he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a monistic and pluralistic approach to such study ecology in the guattarian sense then is a study of complex phenomena including human subjectivity the environment and social relations all of which are intimately interconnected despite this emphasis on interconnection throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with gilles deleuze guattari has resisted calls for holism preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference synthesizing assemblages and multiplicities in order to trace rhizomatic structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures without modifications to the social and material environment there can be no change in mentalities here we are in the presence of a circle that leads me to postulate the necessity of founding an ecosophy that would link environmental ecology to social ecology and to mental ecology guattari 1996 264 guattaris concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind society and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in steps to an ecology of mind a collection of writings by cyberneticist gregory bateson see alsoedit ecology global greens charter
