the annual fuel utilization efficiency afue pronounced a-few or a-f-u-e is a thermal efficiency measure of combustion equipment like furnaces boilers and water heaters the afue differs from the true thermal efficiency in that it is not a steady-state peak measure of conversion efficiency but instead attempts to represent the actual season-long average efficiency of that piece of equipment including the operating transients1 it is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input expressed as a percentage for example a 90 afue for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 btus of useful heating for every 100 btus of natural gas input where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust a higher afue means higher efficiency the method for determining the afue for residential furnaces is the subject of ashrae standard 103 a furnace with a thermal efficiency th of 78 may yield an afue of only 64 or so for example under the standards test conditions when estimating annual or seasonal energy used by combustion devices the afue is the better efficiency measure to use in the calculations2 but for an instantaneous fuel consumption rate the thermal efficiency may be better note that the theoretical limit for a conventional furnaces instantaneous efficiency is 100 whereas a heat pump used for building heating may exceed 100 for example a cop of 1.5 is equivalent to 150 heat pumps are readily available for electric and gas sources3 so from a theoretical perspective in some use cases the name efficiency may be misleading some typical afue numbers4 fuel furnaceboiler afue heating oil cast iron pre-1970 60 retention head burner 7078 mid efficiency 8389 electric heating central or baseboard 100 geothermal heat pump see cop air-source heat pump see hspf natural gas standard efficiency 7884 condensing 9097 propane standard efficiency 7985 condensing 8895 firewood conventional 4555 advanced 5565 state-of-the-art 7590 see alsoedit coefficient of performance cop energy efficiency ratio eer seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer ashrae referencesedit systems and equipment volume of the ashrae handbook ashrae inc atlanta ga usa 2004 heating and cooling of buildings kreider and rabl mcgraw-hill new york 1994 archived copy archived from the original on 2014-03-23 retrieved 2014-12-14 accessed 2014-12-14 canada mortgage and housing corporation ed 2008 1993 a guide to residential home heating pdf 2008 ed isbn978-0-660-19848-4 retrieved 2009-03-23 this article about a mechanical engineering topic is a stub you can help wikipedia by expanding it v t e
