mechanism for regenerative brake on the roof of a koda astra tram the s78 stock on the london underground can return 20 of its energy usage to the network a regenerative brake is an energy recovery mechanism which slows a vehicle or object by converting its kinetic energy into a form which can be either used immediately or stored until needed this contrasts with conventional braking systems where the excess kinetic energy is converted to unwanted and wasted heat by friction in the brakes in addition to improving the overall efficiency of the vehicle regeneration can greatly extend the

form of regenerative brake involves an electric motor as an electric generator in electric railways the electricity generated is fed back into the supply system in battery electric and hybrid electric vehicles the energy is stored chemically in a battery electrically in a bank of capacitors or mechanically in a rotating flywheel hydraulic hybrid vehicles use hydraulic motors to store energy in the form of compressed air practical regenerative brakingedit regenerative braking is not by itself sufficient as the sole means of safely bringing a vehicle to a standstill or slowing it as required so it must be used in conjunction with another braking system such as friction-based braking the regenerative braking effect drops off at lower speeds and cannot bring a vehicle to a complete halt reasonably quickly a regenerative brake does not immobilise a stationary vehicle physical locking is required for example to prevent vehicles from rolling down hills many road vehicles with regenerative braking do not have drive motors on all wheels as in a two-wheel drive car regenerative braking is normally only applicable to wheels with motors for safety the ability to brake all wheels is required the regenerative braking effect available is limited and insufficient in many cases particularly in emergency situations the friction brake is a necessary back-up in the event of failure of the regenerative brake regenerative and friction braking must both be used creating the need to control them to produce the required total braking the gm ev-1 was the first commercial car to do this in 1997 and 1998 engineers abraham farag and loren majersik were issued two patents for this brake-by-wire technology12 early applications commonly suffered from a serious safety hazard in many early electric vehicles with regenerative braking the same controller positions were used to apply power and to apply the regenerative brake with the functions being swapped by a separate manual switch this led to a number of serious accidents when drivers accidentally accelerated when intending to brake such as the runaway train accident in wdenswil switzerland in 1948 which killed twenty-one people conversion to electric energy the motor as a generatoredit a tesla model s p85 using regenerative braking power in excess of 60 kw during regenerative braking the power indicator is green electric motors when used in reverse function as generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy vehicles propelled by electric motors use them as generators when using regenerative braking braking by transferring mechanical energy from the wheels to an electrical load early examples of this system were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by louis antoine krieger in paris in the 1890s the krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with a second set of parallel windings bifilar coil for regenerative braking3 in england the raworth system of regenerative control was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by a raworth of leeds in some detail456 these included tramway systems at devonport 1903 rawtenstall birmingham crystal palace-croydon 1906 and many others slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles the tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail in several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound and the systems on the crystal palace line utilized series-parallel controllersclarification needed7 following a serious accident at rawtenstall an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911 the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later6 regenerative braking has been in extensive use on railways for many decades the baku-tbilisi-batumi railway transcaucasus railway or georgian railway started utilizing regenerative braking in the early 1930s this was especially effective on the steep and dangerous surami pass8 in scandinavia the kiruna to narvik electrified railway carries iron ore on the steeply-graded route from the mines in kiruna in the north of sweden down to the port of narvik in norway to this day the rail cars are full of thousands of tons of iron ore on the way down to narvik and these trains generate large amounts of electricity by regenerative braking with a maximum recuperative braking force of 750kn from riksgrnsen on the national border to the port of narvik the trains9 use only a fifth of the power they regenerate the regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border10 any excess energy from the railway is pumped into the power grid to supply homes and businesses in the region and the railway is a net generator of electricity electric cars used regenerative braking since the earliest experiments but this was often a complex affair where the driver had to flip switches between various operational modes in order to use it the baker electric runabout and the owen magnetic were early examples which used many switches and modes controlled by an expensive black box or drum switch as part of their electrical system1112 these like the krieger design could only practically be used on downhill portions of a trip and had to be manually engaged improvements in electronics allowed this process to be fully automated starting with 1967s amc amitron experimental electric car designed by gulton industries13 the motor controller automatically began battery charging when the brake pedal was applied many modern hybrid and electric vehicles use this technique to extend the range of the battery pack especially those using an ac drive train most earlier designs used dc power electric railway vehicle operationedit in 1886 the sprague electric railway motor company founded by frank j sprague introduced two important inventions a constant-speed non-sparking motor with fixed brushes and regenerative braking during braking the traction motor connections are altered to turn them into electrical generators the motor fields are connected across the main traction generator mg and the motor armatures are connected across the load the mg now excites the motor fields the rolling locomotive or multiple unit wheels turn the motor armatures and the motors act as generators either sending the generated current through onboard resistors dynamic braking or back into the supply regenerative braking compared to electro-pneumatic friction brakes braking with the traction motors can be regulated faster improving the performance of wheel slide protection for a given direction of travel current flow through the motor armatures during braking will be opposite to that during motoring therefore the motor exerts torque in a direction that is opposite from the rolling direction braking effort is proportional to the product of the magnetic strength of the field windings multiplied by that of the armature windings savings of 17 and less wear on friction braking components are claimed for virgin trains pendolinos14 the delhi metro reduced the amount of carbon dioxide co 2 released into the atmosphere by around 90,000 tons by regenerating 112,500 megawatt hours of electricity through the use of regenerative braking systems between 2004 and 2007 it was expected that the delhi metro would reduce its emissions by over 100,000 tons of co 2 per year once its phase ii was complete through the use of regenerative braking15 electricity generated by regenerative braking may be fed back into the traction power supply either offset against other electrical demand on the network at that instant used for head end power loads or stored in lineside storage systems for later use16 a form of what can be described as regenerative braking is used on some parts of the london underground achieved by having small slopes leading up and down from stations the train is slowed by the climb and then leaves down a slope so kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy in the station17 this is normally found on the deep tunnel sections of the network and not generally above ground or on the cut and cover sections of the metropolitan and district lines comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakesedit the box extending sideways from the roof directly over the word operation allows air to freely flow through the resistors of the dynamic brakes on this diesel-electric locomotive what are described as dynamic brakes rheostatic brakes in the uk on electric traction systems unlike regenerative brakes dissipate electric energy as heat rather than using it by passing the current through large banks of variable resistors vehicles that use dynamic brakes include forklift trucks diesel-electric locomotives and trams this heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior or dissipated externally by large radiator-like cowls to house the resistor banks general electrics experimental 1936 steam turbine locos featured true regeneration these two locomotives ran the steam water over the resistor packs as opposed to air cooling used in most dynamic brakes this energy displaced the oil normally burned to keep the water hot and thereby recovered energy that could be used to accelerate again18 the main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines with dc supplies this requires that the voltage be closely controlled the ac power supply and frequency converter pioneer miro zoric and his first ac power electronics have also enabled this to be possible with ac supplies the supply frequency must also be matched this mainly applies to locomotives where an ac supply is rectified for dc motors in areas where there is a constant need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle such as electric train heat or air conditioning this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern ac traction systems this method has become popular with north american passenger railroads where head end power loads are typically in the area of 500kw year round using hep loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the alp-46 and acs-64 to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well a small number of steep grade railways have used 3-phase power supplies and induction motors this results in a near constant speed for all trains as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when driving and braking conversion to mechanical energyedit kinetic energy recovery systemsedit main article kinetic energy recovery system kinetic energy recovery systems kers were used for the motor sport formula ones 2009 season and are under development for road vehicles kers was abandoned for the 2010 formula one season but re-introduced for the 2011 season by 2013 all teams were using kers with marussia starting use for the 2013 season19 one of the main reasons that not all cars used kers immediately is because it raises the cars center of gravity and reduces the amount of ballast that is available to balance the car so that it is more predictable when turning20 fia rules also limit the exploitation of the system the concept of transferring the vehicles kinetic energy using flywheel energy storage was postulated by physicist richard feynman in the 1950scitation needed and is exemplified in such systems as the zytek flybrid21 torotrak2223 and xtrac used in f1 differential based systems also exist such as the cambridge passengercommercial vehicle kinetic energy recovery system cpc-kers24 xtrac and flybrid are both licensees of torotraks technologies which employ a small and sophisticated ancillary gearbox incorporating a continuously variable transmission cvt the cpc-kers is similar as it also forms part of the driveline assembly however the whole mechanism including the flywheel sits entirely in the vehicles hub looking like a drum brake in the cpc-kers a differential replaces the cvt and transfers torque between the flywheel drive wheel and road wheel use in motor sportedit historyedit a flybrid systems kinetic energy recovery system the first of these systems to be revealed was the flybrid this system weighs 24kg and has an energy capacity of 400 kj after allowing for internal losses a maximum power boost of 60kw 81.6 ps 80.4 hp for 6.67 seconds is available the 240mm diameter flywheel weighs 5.0kg and revolves at up to 64,500 rpm maximum torque is 18nm 13.3 ftlbs the system occupies a volume of 13 litrescitation needed two minor incidents have been reported during testing of kers systems in 2008 the first occurred when the red bull racing team tested their kers battery for the first time in july it malfunctioned and caused a fire scare that led to the teams factory being evacuated25 the second was less than a week later when a bmw sauber mechanic was given an electric shock when he touched christian kliens kers-equipped car during a test at the jerez circuit26 fiaedit a kers flywheel formula one have stated that they support responsible solutions to the worlds environmental challenges27 and the fia allowed the use of 81hp 60kw 82ps kers in the regulations for the 2009 formula one season28 teams began testing systems in 2008 energy can either be stored as mechanical energy as in a flywheel or as electrical energy as in a battery or supercapacitor29 with the introduction of kers in the 2009 season four teams used it at some point in the season ferrari renault bmw and mclaren during the season renault and bmw stopped using the system vodafone mclaren mercedes became the first team to win a f1 gp using a kers equipped car when lewis hamilton won the hungarian grand prix on 26 july 2009 their second kers equipped car finished fifth at the following race lewis hamilton became the first driver to take pole position with a kers car his team mate heikki kovalainen qualifying second this was also the first instance of an all kers front row on 30 august 2009 kimi rikknen won the belgian grand prix with his kers equipped ferrari it was the first time that kers contributed directly to a race victory with second placed giancarlo fisichella claiming actually i was quicker than kimi he only took me because of kers at the beginning30 although kers was still legal in f1 in the 2010 season all the teams had agreed not to use it31 new rules for the 2011 f1 season which raised the minimum weight limit of the car and driver by 20kg to 640kg,32 along with the fota teams agreeing to the use of kers devices once more meant that kers returned for the 2011 season33 this is still optional as it was in the 2009 season in the 2011 season 3 teams elected not to use it19 for the 2012 season only marussia and hrt raced without kers and by 2013 with the withdrawal of hrt all 11 teams on the grid were running kers for the 2014 season the power output of the mgu-k the replacement of the kers and part of the ers system that also includes a turbocharger waste heat recovery system increased from 60kw to 120kw and it is allowed to recover 2 mega-joules per lap this was to balance the sports move from 2.4 litre v8 engines to 1.6 litre v6 engines34 the fail-safe settings of the brake-by-wire system that now supplements kers came under examination as a contributing factor in the crash of jules bianchi at the 2014 japanese grand prix autopart makersedit bosch motorsport service is developing a kers for use in motor racing these electricity storage systems for hybrid and engine functions include a lithium-ion battery with scalable capacity or a flywheel a four to eight kilogram electric motor with a maximum power level of

air3839 vodafone mclaren mercedes began testing of their kers in september 2008 at the jerez test track in preparation for the 2009 f1 season although at that time it was not yet known if they would be operating an electrical or mechanical system40 in november 2008 it was announced that freescale semiconductor would collaborate with mclaren electronic systems to further develop its kers for mclarens formula one car from 2010 onwards both parties believed this collaboration would improve mclarens kers system and help the system filter down to road car technology41 toyota has used a supercapacitor for regeneration on supra hv-r hybrid race car that won the 24 hours of tokachi race in july 2007.42 bmw has used regenerative braking on their e90 3 series as well as in current models like f25 5 series under the efficientdynamics moniker43 volkswagen have regenerative braking technologies under the bluemotion brand in such models as the mk7 golf and mk7 golf estate wagon models other vw group brands like seat skoda and audi44 motorcyclesedit ktm racing boss harald bartol has revealed that the factory raced with a secret kinetic energy recovery system kers fitted to tommy koyamas motorcycle during the 2008 season-ending 125cc valencian grand prix this was against the rules so they were banned from doing it afterwards45 bicyclesedit regenerative braking is also possible on a non-electric bicycle the epa working with students from the university of michigan developed the hydraulic regenerative brake launch assist rbla46 it is common on some pedelec bicycles with hub motors while it is not feasible with crank drive systemscitation needed it can be realised with so called direct drive hub motors which means they do not have a freewheel built incitation needed racesedit automobile club de louest the organizer behind the annual 24 hours of le mans event and the le mans series is currently studying specific rules for lmp1 that will be equipped with a kinetic

assumption is made that during braking there is no change in the potential energy enthalpy of the flywheel pressure or volume of the flywheel so only kinetic energy will be considered as the car is

of the car and this percentage can be represented by f l y displaystyle eta _fly  the flywheel stores the energy as rotational kinetic energy because the energy is kept as kinetic energy and not transformed into another type of energy this process is efficient the flywheel can only store so much energy however and this is limited by its maximum amount of rotational kinetic energy this is determined based upon the inertia of the flywheel and its angular velocity as the car sits idle little rotational kinetic energy is lost over time so the initial amount of energy in the flywheel can be assumed to equal the final amount of energy distributed by the flywheel the amount of kinetic energy distributed by the flywheel is therefore k e f l y f l y m v 2 2 displaystyle ke_flyfrac eta
