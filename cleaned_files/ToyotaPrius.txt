social issue15 in february 2011 toyota asked the public to decide on what the most proper plural form of prius should be with choices including prien prii prium prius or priuses1617 the company said it would use the most popular choice in its advertising18 and on 20 february announced that prii was the most popular choice and the new official plural designation19 in latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form prior prior prius of an adjective with only comparative and superlative the superlative being primus prima primum consequently like all third declension words the plural in latin was priora cf latin declension which was used by the lada priora in 2007 despite the official plural form used by toyota priuses remains good english20 and is the more frequently used plural form beginning in september 2011 toyota usa began using the following names to differentiate the original prius from some newer members of the prius family the standard prius became the prius

australia in constructing the prius toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics made out of cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum the two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie kenaf is a member of the hibiscus family a relative to cotton and okra ramie commonly known as china grass is a member of the nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres with a density and absorbency comparable to flax toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the united nations international year of natural fibres which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others69 2011 facelift to create the third-generation prius for 2010 toyota engineers revisited just about everything to eke out further efficiencies a

the next generation prius7576 the next prius is the first vehicle to use the toyota new global architecture tnga modular platform which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity these features along with other improvements allow for gains in ride-and-handling agility and aerodynamics the improved aerodynamics contribute to an all-new exterior design which includes a roomier interior ogiso also explained that the next-generation prius plug-in hybrid the prius prime was developed in parallel with the standard prius model7778 the fourth generation prius has stirred controversy over the style and cohesion of its exterior design with analysis from critics contending that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a haphazard design that falls into the trap of equating aggressiveness with sportiness79 the fourth-generation prius is designed to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost these objectives were achieved through the development of a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery electric motor and gasoline engine technologies it features improved batteries with higher energy density smaller electric motors with higher power density than the previous prius motors and the gasoline engine features a thermal efficiency greater than 40 that of the third-generation prius is 38.5 the prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10 each generation and toyota has set the challenge to continue to

also hybrid synergy drive the toyota prius hybrid synergy drive is a series-parallel full hybrid sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid the prius is a power-split or series-parallel full hybrid sometimes referred to as a combined hybrid a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline andor electric power wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 0.29 for 2000 model with a kammback design to reduce air resistance lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction an electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts157 in the us and canada a vacuum flask is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time the prius engine makes use of the atkinson cycle158 ev modeedit when the vehicle is turned on with the power button it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor in the second generation prius electric pumps warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos159 before the internal combustion engine is started the delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds the third generation prius does not have a coolant thermos instead the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat a button labelled ev maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25mph 40kmh this permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys under 1 mile 1.6km the car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted160161 prior to the 2010 model the north american model did not have the ev button although the ev mode is still supported internally by the prius hybrid vehicle management computercitation needed batteriesedit battery pack from the second generation prius there are two principal battery packs the high voltage hv battery also known as the traction battery and a 12 volt battery known as the low voltage lv battery the traction battery is a sealed 38-module nickel metal hydride nimh battery pack providing 273.6 volts 6.5 ah capacity and weighing 53.3kg 118lb162 and is supplied by japans panasonic ev energy co they are normally charged between 4060 of maximum capacity to prolong battery life as well as allow headroom for regenerative braking each battery pack uses 1015kg 2233lb of lanthanum and each prius electric motor contains 1kg 2lb of neodymium production of the car is described as the biggest user of rare earths of any object in the world163 the lv battery is essential to starting the car providing initial power to the computer the second generation prius contains a 1.310kwh battery composed of 28 modules each battery module is made of 6 individual 1.2v 6.5ah prismatic nimh cells in series forming a 7.2v 6.5ah module with 46whkg energy density and 1,3kwkg output power density164 each module contains an integrated charge controller and relay these modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6v 6.5ah battery traction battery also known as the energy storage system the computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38 and 82 state of charge with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60 by shallow cycling the battery only a small portion of its net available energy storage capacity is available for use approximately 400wh by the hybrid drive system but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life thermal management control and net long term calendar life of the battery active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design battery life cycleedit as the prius reached ten years of being available in the us market in february 2011 consumer reports decided to look at the lifetime of the prius battery and the cost to replace it the magazine tested a 2002 toyota prius with over 200,000 miles on it and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 prius with 2,000 miles tested by consumer reports 10 years before the comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration overall fuel economy of the 2001 model was 40.6 miles per us gallon 5.79l100km 48.8mpg-imp while the 2002 prius with high mileage delivered 40.4 miles per us gallon 5.82l100km 48.5mpg-imp the magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run165 the cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between us2200 and us2600 from a toyota dealer but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around us500165 one study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries166 air conditioning hvacedit the hvac system uses an ac induction motor to drive a scroll compressor using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system while driving it with an ac induction motor makes the system more flexible so the ac can run while the engine is off because the oil used with the gas also flows in the area of the motor-windings it needs to be highly insulating therefore a special oil nd11167 is used the system cannot be maintained with equipment that is used to service regular cars which mainly use pag oils as the equipment would contaminate the nd11 oil with pag oil according to sae j2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1 pag when filling 1 pag oil may result in a resistance drop by a factor of about 10.168 environmental impactedit fuel economy and emissionsedit united states since its inception the toyota prius has been among the best fuel economy vehicles available in the united states and for the model year 2012 the prius family has three models among the top 10 most fuel-efficient cars sold in the country as rated by us environmental protection agency epa3 after the honda insight first generation was discontinued in september 2006 the prius liftback became the most fuel-efficient car sold in the american market3169170 until it was topped by the chevrolet volt in december 2010 as the plug-in hybrid was rated by epa with an overall combined cityhighway gasoline-electricity fuel economy of 60mpg-us 3.9l100km 72mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e171 according to the epa for the model year 2012 and when only gasoline-powered vehicles are considered excluding all-electric cars the prius c ranks as the most fuel-efficient compact car the prius liftback as the most fuel-efficient midsize car and the prius v as the most fuel-efficient midsize station wagon172 more fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than a conventional cars but

co2 emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the prius toyota has not supplied the requested data to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the prius including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption183 toyota states that lifetime co2 saving is 43 percent184 as of 2010update the uk government car service operated over 100 priuses the largest part of its fleet and lists the prius as having the lowest co2 emissions among its fleet185 cnw marketing research initially published a study186 in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 prius was greater than that of a hummer h2 the study has been widely debunked see for example hummer versus prius dust to dust report misleads the media and public with bad science187 electromagnetic field levelsedit prius cutaway model showing forward engine connected to rear high voltage battery the prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car there has been some public concern over whether the levels of electromagnetic field exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars and what health effects those fields may present popularized by a 2008 the new york times article188 however toyota188 and several independent studies189190 have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating the electromagnetic fields within the prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the icnirp191 exposure guidelines a 2013 study by the mayo clinic found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators can safely drive or ride in hybrids or plug-in electric cars without risk of electromagnetic interference emi the research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 toyota prius hybrid the study used 30 participants with implanted devices and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the prius and each position was evaluated at different speeds192 quietnessedit see also electric vehicle warning sounds the wall street journal reported in february 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles193 blind pedestrians are a primary concern and the national federation of the blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles194 but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles however silent vehicles are already relatively common and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-canceling muffler systems in july 2007 a spokesman for toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options195 in 2010 toyota released a device for the third-generation prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity196 japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and the us approved legislation on december 2010.197198 models equipped with automatically activated systems include all 2012 and later model year prius family vehicles that have been introduced in the united states including the standard prius the prius v the prius c and the toyota prius plug-in hybrid72199 the warning sound is activated when the car is traveling at less than 15mph 24kmh and cannot be manually turned off200 marketing and cultureedit co2 advertisingedit in the uk the advertising standards authority an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry ruled that a television advert for the toyota prius should not be broadcast again in the same form having breached rules concerning misleading advertising the advertisement stated that the prius emits up to one tonne less co2 per year while on-screen text included 1 tonne of co2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine average calculated on 20,000 km a year points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison whether up to one tonne less adequately communicated that reductions could be lower and whether the distance used was appropriate 20,000km per year is around a us cars average annual driving distance while a uk cars is 13,440km.201 political symbolismedit prius fleet operated by the new york city department of transportation the large number of prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the the washington post to dub hybrids hollywoods latest politically correct status symbol202 conservatives called prius patriots also drive the cars because they want to contribute to reducing us dependence on foreign oil203 a 2007 san francisco chronicle article said prius progressives were becoming an archetype with american conservative commentator rush limbaugh opining that these liberals think theyre ahead of the game on these things and theyre just suckers204 in july 2007 the new york times published an article using data from cnw marketing research finding that 57 of prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that it makes a statement about me while just 37 cited fuel economy as a prime motivator205 shortly afterwards washington post columnist robert samuelson coined the term prius politics to describe a situation where the drivers desire to show off is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions206 some conservatives promote use of the toyota prius and other hybrid cars for example jim road from what would jesus drive encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large suvs and faster cars can do to others207 former central intelligence agency cia chief r james woolsey jr drives a prius because of its low fuel consumption woolsey noted the volatility of the middle east coupled with anti-us sentiment in much of the region noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the middle east gives vast profits to middle eastern regimes woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles in a motor trend magazine article woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-qaeda meaning that americans who buy inefficient vehicles would in effect be indirectly funding terrorism were paying for both sides in this war and thats not a good long-term strategy said woolsey i have a bumper sticker on the back of my prius that reads bin laden hates this car208 darpa driverless editionedit a driverless version of the prius was one of six cars to finish the 2007 darpa urban challenge209 motorsportsedit a racing version of the car took class pole position210 and finished sixth at the 2012 fuji gt 500km.211 government and corporate incentivesedit see also legislation and incentives towards hybrid vehicles and government incentives for fuel efficient vehicles in the united states there have been a number of governments with incentives intended to encourage hybrid car sales in some countries including the us and canada some rebate incentives have been exhausted while other countries such as the united kingdom sweden belgium and the netherlands have various or alternative incentives to purchasing a hybrid vehicle several us companies offer employees incentives bank of america will reimburse us3000 on the purchase of new hybrid vehicles to full- and part-time associates working more than 20 hours per week212 google213 software company hyperion solutions214 and
