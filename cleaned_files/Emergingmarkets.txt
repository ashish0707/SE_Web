it has been suggested that emerging markets index be merged into this article discuss proposed since february 2015 an emerging market is a country that has some characteristics of a developed market but does not meet standards to be a developed market1 this includes countries that may become developed markets in the future or were in the past2 the term frontier market is used for developing countries with slower economies than emerging34 the economies of china and india are considered to be the largest5 according to the economist many people find the term outdated but no new term has gained traction6 emerging market hedge fund capital reached a record new level in the first quarter of 2011 of 121 billion7 the four largest emerging and developing economies by either nominal or ppp-adjusted gdp are the bric countries brazil russia india and china the next five largest markets are south korea though considered a developed market mexico indonesia turkey and saudi arabia iran

industrialized countries in the 1970s less developed countries ldcs was the common term for markets that were less developed by objective or subjective measures than the developed countries such as the united states western europe and japan these markets were supposed to provide greater potential for profit but also more risk from various factors this term was thought by some to be politically incorrect so the emerging market label was created the term is misleading in that there is no guarantee that a country will move from less developed to more developed although that is the general trend in the world countries can also move from more developed to less developed originally brought into fashion in the 1980s by then world bank economist antoine van agtmael9 the term is sometimes loosely used as a replacement for emerging economies but really signifies a business phenomenon that is not fully described by or constrained to geography or economic strength such countries are considered to be in a transitional phase between developing and developed status examples of emerging markets include many countries in africa most countries in eastern europe some countries of latin america some countries in the middle east russia and some countries in southeast asia emphasizing the fluid nature of the category political scientist ian bremmer defines an emerging market as a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets10 the research on emerging markets is diffused within management literature while researchers including george haley vladimir kvint hernando de soto usha haley and several professors from harvard business school and yale school of management have described activity in countries such as india and china how a market emerges is little understood in 1999 dr kvint published this definition emerging market country is a society transitioning from a dictatorship to a free-market-oriented-economy with increasing economic freedom gradual integration with the global marketplace and with other members of the gem global emerging market an expanding middle class improving standards of living social stability and tolerance as well as an increase in cooperation with multilateral institutions11 in 2008 emerging economy report12 the center for knowledge societies defines emerging economies as those regions of the world that are experiencing rapid informationalization under conditions of limited or partial industrialization it appears that emerging markets lie at the intersection of non-traditional user behavior the rise of new user groups and community adoption of products and services and innovations in product technologies and platforms more critical scholars have also studied key emerging markets like mexico and turkey thomas marois 2012 2 argues that financial imperatives have become much more significant and has developed the idea of emerging finance capitalism - an era wherein the collective interests of financial capital principally shape the logical options and choices of government and state elites over and above those of labor and popular classes13 julien vercueil recently proposed an pragmatic definition of the emerging economies as distinguished from emerging markets coined by an approach heavily influenced by financial criteria according to his definition an emerging economy displays the following characteristics14 intermediate income its ppp per capita income is comprised between 10 and 75 of the average eu per capita income catching-up growth during at least the last decade it has experienced a brisk economic growth that has narrowed the income gap with advanced economies institutional transformations and economic opening during the same period it has undertaken profound institutional transformations which contributed to integrate it more deeply into the world economy hence emerging economies appears to be a by-product of the current globalization at the beginning of the 2010s more than 50 countries representing 60 of the worlds population and 45 of its gdp matched these criteria1410 among them the brics newly industrialized countries as of 2013 this is an intermediate category between fully developed and developing the term rapidly developing economies is being used to denote emerging markets such as the united arab emirates chile and malaysia that are undergoing rapid growth in recent years new terms have emerged to describe the largest developing countries such as bric that stands for brazil russia india and china15 along with bricet bric eastern europe and turkey brics bric south africa bricm bric mexico mint mexico indonesia nigeria and turkey next eleven bangladesh egypt indonesia iran mexico nigeria pakistan the philippines south korea turkey and vietnam and civets colombia indonesia vietnam egypt turkey and south africa16 these countries do not share any common agenda but some experts believe that they are enjoying an increasing role in the world economy and on political platforms it is difficult to make an exact list of emerging or developed markets the best guides tend to be investment information sources like emis a euromoney institutional investor company and the economist or market index makers such as morgan stanley capital international these sources are well-informed but the nature of investment information sources leads to two potential problems one is an element of historicity markets may be maintained in an index for continuity even if the countries have since developed past the emerging market phase possible examples of this are south korea17 and taiwan a second is the simplification inherent in making an index small countries or countries with limited market liquidity are often not considered with their larger neighbours considered an appropriate stand-in in an opalesquetv video hedge fund manager jonathan binder discusses the current and future relevance of the term emerging markets in the financial world binder says that in the future investors will not necessarily think of the traditional classifications of g10 or g7 versus emerging markets instead people should look at the world as countries that are fiscally responsible and countries that are not whether that country is in europe or in south america should make no difference making the traditional blocs of categorization irrelevant gugan et al 2014 also discuss the relevance of the terminology emerging country comparing the credit worthiness of so-called emerging countries to so-called developed countries according to their analysis depending on the criteria used the term may not always be appropriate18 the 10 big emerging markets bem economies are alphabetically ordered argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland south africa south korea and turkey19 egypt iran nigeria pakistan russia saudi arabia taiwan and thailand are other major emerging markets newly industrialized countries are emerging markets whose economies have not yet reached developed status but have in a macroeconomic sense outpaced their developing counterparts individual investors can

emerging market bond index globaledit the emerging market bond index global embi global by jp morgan was the first comprehensive em sovereign index in the market after the embi it provides full coverage of the em asset class with representative countries investable instruments sovereign and quasi-sovereign and transparent rules the embi global includes only usd-denominated emerging markets sovereign bonds and uses a traditional market capitalization weighted method for country allocation30 as of march end 2016 the embi globals market capitalization was 692.3bn.25 for country inclusion a countrys gni per capita must be below the index income ceiling iic for three consecutive years to be eligible for inclusion to the embi global jp morgan defines the index income ceiling iic as the gni per capita level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the world gni per capita atlas method current us provided by the world bank annually an existing country may be considered for removal from the index if its gni per capita is above the index income ceiling iic for three consecutive years as well as the countrys long term foreign currency sovereign credit rating the available ratings from all three agencies sp moodys fitch is a-a3a- inclusive or above for three consecutive years30 jp morgan has introduced what is called an index income ceiling iic defined as the income level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the world gni per capita provided by the world bank as gni per capita atlas method current us annually once a country has gni per capita below or above the iic level for three consecutive years the country eligibility will be determined30 jp morgan have established the base iic level in 1987 to match the world bank high income threshold at us6000 gni per capita every year growth in the world gni per capita figure is applied to the iic establishing a new iic that is dynamic over time this approach ensures that our cutoff for index removal is adjusted by the world income growth rate and not by the inflation rate of a smaller sample of developed economies this metric essentially incorporates real global growth global inflation and currency exchange rate current usd-denominated changes essentially the introduction of the iic establishes a higher more appropriate threshold for country eligibility in the embi globaldiversified
