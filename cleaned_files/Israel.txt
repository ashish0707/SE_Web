jewish migration to ottoman-ruled palestine known as the first aliyah began in 1881 as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe112 although the zionist movement already existed in practice austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism113 a movement which sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel thus offering a solution to the so-called jewish question of the european states in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time114 in 1896 herzl published der judenstaat the state of the jews offering his vision of a future jewish state the following year he presided over the first zionist congress115 the second aliyah 190414 began after the kishinev pogrom some 40,000 jews settled in palestine although nearly half of them left eventually112 both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly orthodox jews116 although the second aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz

in the british conquest of palestine120 arab opposition to british rule and jewish immigration led to the 1920 palestine riots and the formation of a jewish militia known as the haganah meaning the defense in hebrew from which the irgun and lehi or stern gang paramilitary groups later split off121 in 1922 the league of nations granted britain a mandate over palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians122 the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim with jews accounting for about 11,123 and arab christians at about 9.5 of the population124 the third 191923 and fourth aliyahs 192429 brought an additional 100,000 jews to palestine112 finally the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in 1930s europe led to the fifth aliyah with an influx of a quarter of a million jews this was a major cause of the arab revolt of 193639 during which the british mandate authorities alongside the zionist militias of haganah and irgun killed 5,032 arabs and wounded 14,760,125126 resulting in over ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population

and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition141142 on the following day 1 december 1947 the arab higher committee proclaimed a three-day strike and arab gangs began attacking

catastrophe160 first years of the state of israel israel was admitted as a member of the united nations by majority vote on 11 may 1949.161 on 1949 both israel and jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the british acted as a brake on the jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging british interests in egypt162 in the early years of the state the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david ben-gurion dominated israeli politics163164 the kibbutzim or collective farming communities played a pivotal role in establishing the new state165 immigration to israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the non-government sponsored mossad lealiyah bet institution for illegal immigration166 both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries particularly in the middle east and eastern europe where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult mossad lealiyah bet continued to take part in immigration efforts until its disbanding in 1953.167 an influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim lands immigrated to israel during the first 3 years and the number of jews increased from 700,000 to 1,400,000,168 many of whom faced persecution in their original countries169 the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan consequently the population of israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958.168 between 1948 and 1970 approximately 1,150,000 jewish refugees relocated to israel170 the immigrants came to israel for differing reasons some believed in a zionist ideology while others moved to escape persecution there were others that did it for the promise of a better life in israel and a small number that were expelled from their homelands such as british and french jews in egypt after the suez crisis171 some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as maabarot by 1952 over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities172 during this period food clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust173 in 1950 egypt closed the suez canal to israeli shipping and tensions mounted as armed clashes took place along israels borders during the 1950s israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen nearly always against civilians174 mainly from the egyptian-occupied gaza strip175 leading to several israeli counter-raids in 1956 great britain and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal which the egyptians had nationalized see the suez crisis the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping together with the growing amount of fedayeen attacks against israels southern population and recent arab grave and threatening statements prompted israel to attack egypt176177178179 israel joined a secret alliance with great britain and france and overran the sinai peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the united nations in return for guarantees

transit camps for longer186 tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day187 in the early 1960s israel captured nazi war criminal adolf eichmann in

to be israels eternal and indivisible capital meanwhile begins government provided incentives for israelis to settle in the occupied west bank increasing friction with the palestinians in that area208 the basic law jerusalem the capital of israel passed in 1980 was believed by some to reaffirm israels 1967 annexation of jerusalem by government decree and reignited international controversy over the status of the city no israeli legislation has defined the territory of israel and no act specifically included east jerusalem therein209 the position of the majority of un member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by israel to settle its citizens in the west bank and impose its laws and administration on east jerusalem are illegal and have no validity210 in 1981 israel annexed the golan heights although annexation was not recognized internationally211 on 7 june 1981 the israeli air force destroyed iraqs sole nuclear reactor in order to impede iraqs

second arab country to normalize relations with israel222 arab public support for the accords was damaged by the continuation of israeli settlements223 and checkpoints and the deterioration of economic conditions224 israeli public support for the accords waned as israel was struck by palestinian suicide attacks225 finally while leaving a peace rally in november 1995 yitzhak rabin was

state the proposed state included the entirety of the gaza strip and over 90 of the west bank with jerusalem as a shared capital229 although some argue that the plan was to annex areas which would lead to a cantonization of the west bank into three blocs which the palestinian delegation likened to south african bantustans a loaded word that was disputed by the israeli and american negotiators230 each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks the tel aviv dolphinarium the site of the 2001 dolphinarium discotheque suicide bombing in which 21 israelis mostly teenagers were killed after the collapse of the talks and a controversial visit by likud leader ariel sharon to the temple mount the second intifada began some commentators contend that the uprising was

force destroyed a nuclear reactor in syria in may 2008 israel confirmed it had been discussing a peace treaty with syria for a year with turkey as a go-between242 however at the end of the year israel

this tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region the entire jordan valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 the deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of mw74260 the most catastrophic earthquakes we know of

states france and israel new york palgrave macmillan pp167169 isbn978-1-137-38115-6 the compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel however there is no other law that declares israels neutrality toward all confessions judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the jewish muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make israel a neutral state this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this self-restrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community as surprising as it seems if not paradoxical for a state in war israel is the only western democratic country in which sharia enjoys

isbn9780773529939 although there is no official religion in israel there is also no clear separation between religion and state in israeli public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultra-orthodox national-religious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and non-observance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and non-observant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments on one hand the declaration of independence adopted in 1948 explicitly guarantees freedom of religion on the other it simultaneously prevents
