holistic practices strive protect restore ecosystems maximize economic productivity2 sustainability forest comes uncertainties factors affect forest harvesting internal conditions effects soil compaction tree damage disease fire blow directly affect ecosystem3 factors account determining sustainability forest factors added harvesting production comes forest forest likely survive sustainable
