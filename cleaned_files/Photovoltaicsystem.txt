system of about 400 kwp power plant on mt komekura japan solar pv system on germanys highest mountain-top a photovoltaic system also solar pv power system or pv system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics it consists of an arrangement of several components including solar panels to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity a solar inverter to change the electric current from dc to ac as well as mounting cabling and other electrical accessories to set up a working system it may also use a solar tracking system to improve the systems overall performance and include an integrated battery solution as prices for storage devices are expected to decline strictly speaking a solar array only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels the visible part of the pv system and does not include all the other hardware often summarized as balance of system bos moreover pv systems convert light directly into electricity and shouldnt be confused with other technologies such as concentrated solar power or solar thermal used for heating and cooling pv systems range from small rooftop-mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts nowadays most pv systems are grid-connected while off-grid or stand-alone systems only account for a small portion of the market operating silently and without any moving parts or environmental emissions pv systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation a rooftop system recoups the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean renewable energy over a 30-year service lifetime13023 due to the exponential growth of photovoltaics prices for pv systems have rapidly declined in recent years however they vary by market and the size of the system in 2014 prices for residential 5-kilowatt systems in the united states were around 3.29 per watt4 while in the highly penetrated german market prices for rooftop systems of up to 100kw declined to 1.24 per watt5 nowadays solar pv modules account for less than half of the systems overall cost6 leaving the rest to the remaining bos-components and to soft costs which include customer acquisition

of the possible components of a photovoltaic system a photovoltaic system converts the suns radiation into usable electricity it comprises the solar array and the balance of system components pv systems can be categorized by various aspects such as grid-connected vs stand alone systems building-integrated vs rack-mounted systems residential vs utility systems distributed vs centralized systems rooftop vs ground-mounted systems tracking vs fixed-tilt systems and new constructed vs retrofitted systems other distinctions may include systems with microinverters vs central inverter systems using crystalline silicon vs thin-film technology and systems with modules from chinese vs european and us-manufacturers about 99 percent of all european and 90 percent of all us solar power systems are connected to the electrical grid while off-grid systems are somewhat more common in australia and south korea814 pv systems rarely use battery storage this may change soon as government incentives for distributed energy storage are being implemented and investments in storage solutions are gradually becoming economically viable for small systems910 a solar array of a typical residential pv system is rack-mounted on the roof rather than integrated into the roof or facade of the building as this is significantly more expensive utility-scale solar power stations are ground-mounted with fixed tilted solar panels rather than using expensive tracking devices crystalline silicon is the predominant material used in 90 percent of worldwide produced solar modules while rival thin-film has lost market-share in recent years11720 about 70 percent of all solar cells and modules are produced in china and taiwan leaving only 5 percent to european and us-manufacturers11112 the installed capacity for both small rooftop systems and large solar power stations is growing rapidly and in equal parts although there is a notable trend towards utility-scale systems as the focus on new installations is shifting away from europe to sunnier regions such as the sunbelt in the us which are less opposed to ground-mounted solar farms and cost-effectiveness is more emphasized by investors843 driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication the cost of photovoltaics is declining continuously3 there are several million pv systems distributed all over the world mostly in europe with 1.4 million systems in germany alone15as well as north america with 440,000 systems in the united states11 the energy conversion efficiency of a conventional solar module increased from 15 to 20 percent over the last 10 years117 and a pv system recoups the energy needed for its manufacture in about 2 years in exceptionally irradiated locations or when thin-film technology is used the so-called energy payback time decreases to one year or less13033 net metering and financial incentives such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity have also greatly supported installations of pv systems in many countries12 the levelised cost of electricity from large-scale pv systems has become competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions and grid parity has been achieved in about 30 different countries131415 as of 2015 the fast-growing global pv market is rapidly approaching the 200gw mark about 40 times the installed capacity of 2006.16 photovoltaic systems currently contribute about 1 percent to worldwide electricity generation top installers of pv systems in terms of capacity are currently china japan and the united states while half of the worlds capacity is installed in europe with germany and italy supplying 7 to 8 of their respective domestic electricity consumption with solar pv17 the international energy agency expects solar power to become the worlds largest source of electricity by 2050 with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar thermal contributing 16 and 11 to the global demand respectively7 grid-connectionedit main article grid-connected photovoltaic power system schematics of a typical residential pv system a grid connected system is connected to a larger independent grid typically the public electricity grid and feeds energy directly into the grid this energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point the difference being whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customers energy consumption feed-in tariff or only on the difference of energy net metering grid connected systems vary in size from residential 210kwp to solar power stations up to 10s of mwp this is a form of decentralized electricity generation the feeding of electricity into the grid requires the transformation of dc into ac by a special synchronising grid-tie inverter in kilowatt-sized installations the dc side system voltage is as high as permitted typically 1000v except us residential 600v to limit ohmic losses most modules 60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells generate 160w to 300w at 36 volts it is sometimes necessary or desirable to connect the modules partially in parallel rather than all in series one set of modules connected in series is known as a string18 scale of systemedit photovoltaic systems are generally categorized into three distinct market segments residential rooftop commercial rooftop and ground-mount utility-scale systems their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts a typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher cost per watt than large utility-scale installations they account for the largest share in the market there is however a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants especially in the sunbelt region of the planet84319 utility-scale main article photovoltaic power station perovo solar park in ukraine large utility-scale solar parks or farms are power stations and capable of providing an energy supply to large numbers of consumers generated electricity is fed into the transmission grid powered by central generation plants grid-connected or grid-tied plant or combined with one or many domestic electricity generators to feed into a small electrical grid hybrid plant in rare cases generated electricity is stored or used directly by islandstandalone plant2021 pv systems are generally designed in order to ensure the highest energy yield for a given investment some large photovoltaic power stations such as solar star waldpolenz solar park and topaz solar farm cover tens or hundreds of hectares and have power outputs up to hundreds of megawatts rooftop mobile and portable main article rooftop photovoltaic power station rooftop system near boston usa a small pv system is capable of providing enough ac electricity to power a single home or even an isolated device in the form of ac or dc electric for example military and civilian earth observation satellites street lights construction and traffic signs electric cars solar-powered tents22 and electric aircraft may contain integrated photovoltaic systems to provide a primary or auxiliary power source in the form of ac or dc power depending on the design and power demands in 2013 rooftop systems accounted for 60 percent of worldwide installations however there is a trend away from rooftop and towards utility-scale pv systems as the focus of new pv installations is also shifting from europe to countries in the sunbelt region of the planet where opposition to ground-mounted solar farms is less accentuated843 portable and mobile pv systems provide electrical power independent of utility connections for off the grid operation such systems are so commonly used on recreational vehicles and boats that there are retailers specializing in these applications23 and products specifically targeted to them2425 since recreational vehicles rv normally carry batteries and operate lighting and other systems on nominally 12-volt dc power rv pv systems normally operate in a voltage range chosen to charge 12-volt batteries directly and addition of a pv system requires only panels a charge controller and wiring building-integrated main article building-integrated photovoltaics bapv wall near barcelona spain in urban and suburban areas photovoltaic arrays are commonly used on rooftops to supplement power use often the building will have a connection to the power grid in which case the energy produced by the pv array can be sold back to the utility in some sort of net metering agreement some utilities such as solvay electric in solvay ny use the rooftops of commercial customers and telephone poles to support their use of pv panels26 solar trees are arrays that as the name implies mimic the look of trees provide shade and at night can function as street lights performanceedit uncertainties in revenue over time relate mostly to the evaluation of the solar resource and to the performance of the system itself in the best of cases uncertainties are typically 4 for year-to-year climate variability 5 for solar resource estimation in a horizontal plane 3 for estimation of irradiation in the plane of the array 3 for power rating of modules 2 for losses due to dirt and soiling 1.5 for losses due to snow and 5 for other sources of error identifying and reacting to manageable losses is critical for revenue and om efficiency monitoring of array performance may be part of contractual agreements between the array owner the builder and the utility purchasing the energy producedcitation needed recently a method to create synthetic days using readily available weather data and verification using the open solar outdoors test field make it possible to predict photovoltaic systems performance with high degrees of accuracy27 this method can be used to then determine loss mechanisms on a local scale - such as those from snow 2829 or the effects of surface coatings eg hydrophobic or hydrophilic on soiling or snow losses30 although in heavy snow environments with severe ground interference can result in annual losses from snow of 30.31 access to the internet has allowed a further improvement in energy monitoring and communication dedicated systems are available from a number of vendors for solar pv system that use microinverters panel-level dc to ac conversion module power data is automatically provided some systems allow setting performance alerts that trigger phoneemailtext warnings when limits are reached these solutions provide data for the system owner and the installer installers are able to remotely monitor multiple installations and see at-a-glance the status of their entire installed basecitation needed componentsedit the balance of system components of a pv system bos balance the power-generating subsystem of the solar array left side with the power-using side of the ac-household devices and the utility grid right side a photovoltaic system for residential commercial or industrial energy supply consists of the solar array and a number of components often summarized as the balance of system bos the term originates from the fact that some bos-components are balancing the power-generating subsystem of the solar array with the power-using side the load bos-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting typically one or more dc to ac power converters also known as inverters an energy storage device a racking system that supports the solar array electrical wiring and interconnections and mounting for other components optionally a balance of system may include any or all of the following renewable energy credit revenue-grade meter maximum power point tracker mppt battery system and charger gps solar tracker energy management software solar irradiance sensors anemometer or task-specific accessories designed to meet specialized requirements for a system owner in addition a cpv system requires optical lenses or mirrors and sometimes a cooling system the terms solar array and pv system are often used interchangeably despite the fact that the solar array does not encompass the entire system moreover solar panel is often used as a synonym for solar module although a panel consists of a string of several modules the term solar system is also an often used misnomer for a pv system solar arrayedit further information pv module conventional c-si solar cells normally wired in series are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather the module consists of a tempered glass as cover a soft and flexible encapsulant a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant material and an aluminium frame around the outer edge electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure solar modules build a string of modules often called solar panel a solar array consists of one or many such panels32 a photovoltaic array or solar array is a linked collection of solar panels the power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business so the modules are linked together to form an array most pv arrays use an inverter to convert the dc power produced by the modules into alternating current that can power lights motors and other loads the modules in a pv array are usually first connected in series to obtain the desired voltage the individual strings are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current solar panels are typically measured under stc standard test conditions or ptc pvusa test conditions in watts33 typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts34 the array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings in watts kilowatts or megawatts module and efficiency a typical 150 watt pv module is about a square meter in size such a module may be expected to produce 0.75 kilowatt-hour kwh every day on average after taking into account the weather and the latitude for an insolation of 5 sun hoursday in the last 10 years the efficiency of average commercial wafer-based crystalline silicon modules increased from about 12 to 16 and cdte module efficiency increased from 9 to 13 during same period module output and life degraded by increased temperature allowing ambient air to flow over and if possible behind pv modules reduces this problem effective module lives are typically 25 years or more35 the payback period for an investment in a pv solar installation varies greatly and is typically less useful than a calculation of return on investment36 while it is typically calculated to be between 10 and 20 years the financial payback period can be far shorter with incentives37 fixed tilt solar array in of crystalline silicon panels in canterbury new hampshire united states solar array of a solar farm with a few thousand solar modules on the island of majorca spain due to the low voltage of an individual solar cell typically ca 0.5v several cells are wired also see copper used in pv systems in series in the manufacture of a laminate the laminate is assembled into a protective weatherproof enclosure thus making a photovoltaic module or solar panel modules may then be strung together into a photovoltaic array in 2012 solar panels available for consumers can have an efficiency of up to about 17,38 while commercially available panels can go as far as 27 it has been recorded that a group from the the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems have created a cell that can reach 44.7 efficiency which makes scientists hopes of reaching the 50 efficiency threshold a lot more feasible39404142 shading and dirt photovoltaic cell electrical output is extremely sensitive to shading the effects of this shading are well known434445 when even a small portion of a cell module or array is shaded while the remainder is in sunlight the output falls dramatically due to internal short-circuiting the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the p-n junction if the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell the current and so power developed by the string is limited if enough voltage is available from the rest of the cells in a string current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion this breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts instead of adding to the power produced by the panel the shaded cell absorbs power turning it into heat since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string disproportionately affecting panel output for example a shaded cell may drop 8 volts instead of adding 0.5 volts at a particular current level thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells46 it is thus important that a pv installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions several methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to pv systems over both large regions using lidar47 but also at an individual system level using sketchup48 most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the shaded portion of the array the main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array and cause fires sunlight can be absorbed by dust snow or other impurities at the surface of the module this can reduce the light that strikes the cells in general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in canada28 maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance over the life of the module google found that cleaning the flat mounted solar panels after 15 months increased their output by almost 100 but that the 5 tilted arrays were adequately cleaned by rainwater2949 insolation and energy global solar potential solar insolation is made up of direct diffuse and reflected radiation the absorption factor of a pv cell is dened as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell50 at high noon on a cloudless day at the equator the power of the sun is about 1 kwm51 on the earths surface to a plane that is perpendicular to the suns rays as such pv arrays can track the sun through each day to greatly enhance energy collection however tracking devices add cost and require maintenance so it is more common for pv arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face solar noon approximately due south in the northern hemisphere or due north in the southern hemisphere the tilt angle from horizontal can be varied for season52 but if fixed should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system this optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output53 the optimization of the a photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux soiling and snow losses should be taken into effect in addition recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection for example the spectral albedo can play a significant role in output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system 54 and the type of solar cell material55 for the weather and latitudes of the united states and europe typical insolation ranges from 4 kwhmday in northern climes to 6.5 kwhmday in the sunniest regions a photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of europe or the united states may expect to produce 1 kwhmday a typical 1kw photovoltaic installation in australia or the southern latitudes of europe or united states may produce 3.55kwh per day dependent on location orientation tilt insolation and other factors56 in the sahara desert with less cloud cover and a better solar angle one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kwhmday provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units the area of the sahara desert is over 9 million km 90,600km or about 1 could generate as much electricity as all of the worlds power plants combined57 mountingedit main article photovoltaic mounting system a 23-year-old ground mounted pv system from the 1980s on a north frisian island germany the modules conversion efficiency was only 12 modules are assembled into arrays on some kind of mounting system which may be classified as ground mount roof mount or pole mount for solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground and the modules mounted on the rack for buildings many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs for flat roofs racks bins and building integrated solutions are usedcitation needed solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving see trackers below side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top such as a light fixture or an antenna pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside which increases performance a multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure a rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down cablingedit main articles solar cable and electrical wiring due to their outdoor usage solar cables are specifically designed to be resistant against uv radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather a number of standards specify the usage of electrical wiring in pv systems such as the iec 60364 by the international electrotechnical commission in section 712 solar photovoltaic pv power supply systems the british standard bs 7671 incorporating regulations relating to microgeneration and photovoltaic systems and the us ul4703 standard in subject 4703 photovoltaic wire trackeredit main article solar tracker a 1998 model of a passive solar tracker viewed from underneath a solar tracking system tilts a solar panel throughout the day depending on the type of tracking system the panel is either aimed directly at the sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 2025 for a single axis tracker and about 30 or more for a dual axis tracker depending on latitude5859 trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly in diffuse light ie under cloud or fog tracking has little or no value because most concentrated photovoltaics systems are very sensitive to the sunlights angle tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day60 tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons first when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled second direct light is used more efficiently than angled lightcitation needed special anti-reflective coatings can improve solar panel efficiency for direct and angled light somewhat reducing the benefit of tracking61 trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional but tracking systems can increase viable output by up to 45.62 pv arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers accounting for clouds and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator and that the sun sets in the evening the correct measure of solar power is insolation the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day for the weather and latitudes of the united states and europe typical insolation ranges from 2.26kwhmday in northern climes to 5.61kwhmday in the sunniest regions6364 for large systems the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity trackers can increase efficiency by 30 or more for very large systems the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment65 tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration photovoltaic systems for high-concentration photovoltaic systems dual axis tracking is a necessity66 pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track when solar panel prices drop trackers become a less attractive option inverteredit main articles solar inverter solar micro-inverter and power inverter central inverter with ac and dc disconnects on the side monitoring gateway transformer isolation and interactive lcd systems designed to deliver alternating current ac such as grid-connected applications need an inverter to convert the direct current dc from the solar modules to ac grid connected inverters must supply ac electricity in sinusoidal form synchronized to the grid frequency limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off67 islanding inverters need only produce regulated voltages and frequencies in a sinusoidal waveshape as no synchronisation or co-ordination with grid supplies is required string inverter left generation meter and ac disconnect right a modern 2013 installation in vermont united states a solar inverter may connect to a string of solar panels in some installations a solar micro-inverter is connected at each solar panel68 for safety reasons a circuit breaker is provided both on the ac and dc side to enable maintenance ac output may be connected through an electricity meter into the public grid69 the number of modules in the system determines the total dc watts capable of being generated by the solar array however the inverter ultimately governs the amount of ac watts that can be distributed for consumption for example a pv system comprising 11 kilowatts dc kwdc worth of pv modules paired with one 10-kilowatt ac kwac inverter will be limited to the inverters output of 10kw as of 2014 conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art converters reached more than 98 percent while string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial pv systems central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent respectively leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters70 maximum power point tracking mppt is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array in order to do so the inverters mppt system digitally samples the solar arrays ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal maximum power point71 anti-islanding is a protection mechanism that immediately shuts down the inverter preventing it from generating ac power when the connection to the load no longer exists this happens for example in the case of a blackout without this protection the supply line would become an island with power surrounded by a sea of unpowered lines as the solar array continues to deliver dc power during the power outage islanding is a hazard to utility workers who may not realize that an ac circuit is still powered and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices72 inverterconverter market in 2014 type power efficiencya market shareb remarks string inverter up to 100kwpc 98 50

surplus to be later used at night batteries used for grid-storage also stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads and play an important role in a smart grid as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high common battery technologies used in todays pv systems include the valve regulated lead-acid battery a modified version of the conventional leadacid battery nickelcadmium and lithium-ion batteries compared to the other types lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density however due to their high reliability low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale residential pv systems as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries furthermore as storage devices for pv systems are stationary the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as for example in electric transportation949 other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed pv systems include sodiumsulfur and vanadium redox batteries two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery respectively94 in 2015 tesla motors launched the powerwall a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with the aim to revolutionize energy consumption73 pv systems with an integrated battery solution also need a charge controller as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging74 basic charge controllers may simply turn the pv panels on and off or may meter out pulses of energy as needed a strategy called pwm or pulse-width modulation more advanced charge controllers will incorporate mppt logic into their battery charging algorithms charge controllers may also divert energy to some purpose other than battery charging rather than simply shut off the free pv energy when not needed a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full monitoring and meteringedit main articles net metering energy metering and smart meter the metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions or two meters must be used many meters accumulate bidirectionally some systems use two meters but a unidirectional meter with detent will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid75 in some countries for installations over 30 kwp a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required this is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility and the excess can not either be exported or stored grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity now they need to also provide storage this is normally hydro-storage but other means of storage are used initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output with variable renewable energy storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available and consumption whenever it is needed a canadian electricity meter the two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for when it is needed or transmitting it to where it is needed if both of those fail installations over 30kwp can automatically shut down although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power and results in a substantial loss of revenue76 three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements77 photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize their operation there are several photovoltaic monitoring strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature monitoring can be performed on site or remotely it can measure production only retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment probes meters etc monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software78 energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes a third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters using the inverter manufacturers protocols and also acquire weather-related information independent smart meters may measure the total energy production of a pv array system separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter a pyranometer can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison79 data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over the world wide web such as osotf80818283 other systemsedit this section includes systems that are either highly specialized and uncommon or still an emerging new technology with limited significance however standalone or off-grid systems take a special place they were the most common type of systems during the 1980s and 1990s when pv technology was still very expensive and a pure niche market of small scale applications only in places where no electrical grid was available they were economically viable although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing in europe off-grid systems account for 1 percent of installed capacity in the united states they account for about 10 percent off-grid systems are still common in australia and south korea and in many developing countries814 cpvedit main article concentrator photovoltaics concentrator photovoltaic cpv in catalonia spain concentrator photovoltaics cpv and high concentrator photovoltaic hcpv systems use optical lenses or curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient solar cells besides concentrating optics cpv systems sometime use solar trackers and cooling systems and are more expensive especially hcpv systems are best suited in location with high solar irradiance concentrating sunlight up to 400 times or more with efficiencies of 2428 percent exceeding those of regular systems various designs of cpv and hcpv systems are commercially available but not very common however ongoing research and development is taking place126 cpv is often confused with csp concentrated solar power that does not use photovoltaics both technologies favor locations that receive much sunlight and are directly competing with each other hybridedit a wind-solar pv hybrid system a hybrid system combines pv with other forms of generation usually a diesel generator biogas is also used the other form of generation may be a type able to modulate power output as a function of demand however more than one renewable form of energy may be used eg wind the photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel hybrid systems are most often found on islands pellworm island in germany and kythnos island in greece are notable examples both are combined with wind8485 the kythnos plant has reduced diesel consumption by 11.2.86 in 2015 a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids however financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant while cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities such as independent power producers8788 there has also been recent work showing that the pv penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of pvchp hybrid systems in the us89 the temporal distribution of solar flux electrical and heating requirements for representative us single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing chp with pv can enable additional pv deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system this theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems90 in addition large pvchp systems are possible for institutional buildings which again provide back up for intermittent pv and reduce chp runtime91 pvt system hybrid pvt also known as photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy such a system combines a solar pv module with a solar thermal collector in an complementary way cpvt system a concentrated photovoltaic thermal

cpvcsp hybrid system has been proposed recently combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-pv technology of concentrated solar power csp or also known as concentrated solar thermal92 pv diesel system it combines a photovoltaic system with a diesel generator93 combinations with other renewables are possible and include wind turbines94 floating solar arraysedit floating solar arrays are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds a small number of such systems exist in france india japan south korea the united kingdom singapore and the united states9596979899 the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land the cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation unlike most land-based solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land because water cools the panels the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion100 in may 2008 the far niente winery in oakville california pioneered the worlds first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar pv modules with a total capacity of 477kw onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winerys irrigation pond101 the primary benefit of such a system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose in the case of the far niente winery it saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system102 another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion the floating pv array also reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibits the growth of algae103 utility-scale floating pv farms are starting to be built the multinational electronics and ceramics manufacturer kyocera will develop the worlds largest a 13.4mw farm on the reservoir above yamakura dam in chiba prefecture104 using 50,000 solar panels105106 salt-water resistant floating farms are also being considered for ocean use with experiments in thailand107 the largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350mw power station in the amazon region of brazil108 direct current gridedit dc grids are found in electric powered transport railways trams and trolleybuses a few pilot plants for such applications have been built such as the tram depots in hannover leinhausen using photovoltaic contributors109 and geneva bachet de pesay110 the 150kwp geneva site feeds 600v dc directly into the tramtrolleybus electricity network whereas before it provided about 15 of the electricity at its opening in 1999 standaloneedit an isolated mountain hut in catalonia spain solar parking meter in edinburgh scotland a stand-alone or off-grid system is not connected to the electrical grid standalone systems vary widely in size and application from wristwatches or calculators to remote buildings or spacecraft if the load is to be supplied independently of solar insolation the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery in non-portable applications where weight is not an issue such as in buildings lead acid batteries are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse a charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging it may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique mppt however in simple pv systems where the pv module voltage is matched to the battery voltage the use of mppt electronics is generally considered unnecessary since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the pv module in small devices eg calculators parking meters only direct current dc is consumed in larger systems eg buildings remote water pumps ac is usually required to convert the dc from the modules or batteries into ac an inverter is used in agricultural settings the array may be used to directly power dc pumps without the need for an inverter in remote settings such as mountainous areas islands or other places where a power grid is unavailable solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity usually by charging a storage battery stand-alone systems closely relate to microgeneration and distributed generation pico pv systems the smallest often portable photovoltaic systems are called pico solar pv systems or pico solar they mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller with a very small pv panel the panels nominal capacity is just a few watt-peak 110 wp and its area less than a tenth of a square meter or one square foot in size a large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players fans portable lamps security lights solar lighting kits solar lanterns and street light see below phone chargers radios or even small seven-inch lcd televisions that run on less than ten watts as it is the case for power generation from pico hydro pico pv systems are useful in small rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably in particular due to the usage of led lights and efficient rechargeable batteries pico solar has become an affordable alternative especially in the developing world111 the metric prefix pico- stands for a trillionth to indicate the smallness of the systems electric power solar street lights solar street lights raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure the solar array of such off-grid pv system charges a rechargeable battery which powers a fluorescent or led lamp during the night solar street lights are stand-alone power systems and have the advantage of savings on trenching landscaping and maintenance costs as well as on the electric bills despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting they are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation they are expected to dim only slightly telecommunication and signaling solar pv power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange radio and tv broadcasting microwave and other forms of electronic communication links this is because in most telecommunication application storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically dc in hilly and mountainous terrain radio and tv signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain at these locations low power transmitters are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population112 solar vehicles solar vehicle whether ground water air or space vehicles may obtain some or all of the energy required for their operation from the sun surface vehicles generally require higher power levels than can be sustained by a practically sized solar array so a battery assists in meeting peak power demand and the solar array recharges it space vehicles have successfully used solar photovoltaic systems for years of operation eliminating the weight of fuel or primary batteries solar pumps one of the most cost effective solar applications is a solar powered pump as it is far cheaper to purchase a solar panel than it is to run power lines113114115 they often meet a need for water beyond the reach of power lines taking the place of a windmill or windpump one common application is the filling of livestock watering tanks so that grazing cattle may drink another is the refilling of drinking water storage tanks on remote or self-sufficient homes spacecraft solar panels on spacecraft have been one of the first applications of photovoltaics since the launch of vanguard 1 in 1958 the first satellite to use solar cells contrary to sputnik the first artificial satellite to orbit the planet that ran out of batteries within 21 days due to the lack of solar-power most modern communications satellites and space probes in the inner solar system rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight116117 do it yourself community with a growing interest in environmentally friendly green energy an increasing number of hobbyists in the diy-community have endeavored to build their own solar pv systems from kits118 or partly diy119 usually the diy-community uses inexpensive120 or high efficiency systems121 such as those with solar tracking to generate their own power as a result the diy-systems often end up cheaper than their commercial counterparts122 often the system is also hooked up into the regular power grid using net metering instead of a battery for backup these systems usually generate power amount of 2kw or less through the internet the community is now able to obtain plans to partly construct the system and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements gallery of standalone systems see also list of solar-powered products and stand-alone power system profile picture of a mobile solar powered generator solar panels on a

prices for residential pv systems in japan germany and the united states w history of solar rooftop prices since 2006 comparison in us per installed watt123124 japan united states germany the cost of producing photovotaic cells have dropped due to economies of scale in production and technological advances in manufacturing for large-scale installations prices below 1.00 per watt were common by 2012.125 a price decrease of 50 had been achieved in europe from 2006 to 2011 and there is a potential to lower the generation cost by 50 by 2020.126 crystal silicon solar cells have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed recently at lower costs of production although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline siwafers they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs127 the table below shows the total cost in us cents per kwh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system128129 the row headings on the left show the total cost per peak kilowatt kwp of a photovoltaic installation photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in germany for example were reported to have fallen to usd 1389kwp by the end of 2014.130 the column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kwh expected from each installed kwp this varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight it also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar declination solar tracking can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight thereby raising the total energy output the calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kwh produced they assume a 10 total capital
