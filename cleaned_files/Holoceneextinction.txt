declared extinct in 2008 the holocene extinction otherwise referred to as the sixth extinction1 or anthropocene extinction2 is the ongoing extinction event of species during the present holocene epoch 11,700 years before ad2000 mainly due to human activity34 the large number of extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals including mammals birds amphibians reptiles and arthropods although 875 extinctions occurring between 1500 and 2009 have been documented by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources5 with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest as well as other areas the vast majority are thought to be undocumented according to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year6 making it the greatest loss of biodiversity since the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event the holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago the end of the last ice age megafauna outside of the african continent which did not evolve alongside humans proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the earth additionally many african species have also gone extinct in the holocene the extinction of the mammoths allowed grasslands they had maintained through grazing habits to become birch forests7 the new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change7 such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans38 these extinctions occurring near the pleistoceneholocene boundary are sometimes referred to as the quaternary extinction event there is no general agreement on where the holocene or anthropogenic extinction begins and the quaternary extinction event which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last ice age ends or if they should be considered separate events at all78 some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in australia new zealand and madagascar9 in a similar way that any large adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would in many cases it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna particularly on geographically isolated islands1011 only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses12 the ecology of homo sapiens has been noted as being that of an unprecedented global superpredator13 that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs14 extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean with many famous examples within africa asia europe australia north and south america and on smaller islands15 overall the holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment the holocene extinction continues into the 21st century with overfishing ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity it has been suggested human activity has made the period following the mid-20th century different enough from the holocene to consider it a new geological epoch known as the anthropocene16 which will be considered for implementation into the timeline of earths history by the international commission on stratigraphy in 2016.17 contents 1 human influence on extinction 1.1

over 12,000 years ago there is evidence that abrupt climate change has especially played an enormous role in the extinction of larger mammals18 however while previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes research shows that wherever on earth humans have migrated other species have gone extinct and human population growth most prominently in the past two centuries is regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction19 in terms of how humans have contributed three major factors include the increased global concentration of greenhouse gases affecting the global climate oceanic devastation such as through overfishing and contamination and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely human-centered ends with 13 percent of earths ice-free land surface now used as row-crop agricultural sites 26 percent used as pastures and 4 percent urban-industrial areas20 thus replacing the original local ecosystems2122 other related human causes of the extinction event include deforestation hunting pollution23 the introduction in various regions of non-native species and the widespread transmission of infectious diseases at present the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the base or historically typical rate of extinction in terms of the natural evolution of the planet24 and also the current rate of extinction is therefore 10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of earth it is also the only known mass extinction of plantscitation needed the abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic or due to human activity have sometimes especially when referring to hypothesized future events been collectively called the anthropocene extinction2526 the anthropocene is a term introduced in 2000 it is now posited by some that a new geological epoch has begun characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago9 in the future of life 2002 eo wilson of harvard calculated that if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues one-half of earths higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100 a 1998 poll conducted by the american museum of natural history found that seventy percent of biologists believe that we are in the midst of an anthropogenic extinction27 numerous scientific studiessuch as a 2004 report published in nature28 and papers authored by the 10,000 scientists who contribute to the iucns annual red list of threatened specieshave since reinforced this conviction extinction of the megafauna in the late-pleistoceneedit the evidence of all previous extinctions is geological in nature and shorter geological time scale is of the order of several hundred thousand to several million years even extinctions caused by instantaneous events such as the impact of the asteroid in chicxulub which is currently the best example extend the equivalent of many human lives due to complex ecological interactions that were triggered by the eventcitation needed the of megafauna on different land masses over time with the arrival of humans indicated three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene of these only two have much scientific credibility although ross mcphee proposed that a hyper-disease may have been the cause of the extinction29 a study by lyons et al demonstrated conclusively that a hyperdisease was unlikely to have caused the extinction30 the two main theories to the extinction are climate change and human hunting the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction31 some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the mega-fauna at the end of the pleistocene but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part with others even suggesting that the two interacted93233 in the americas a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the younger dryas impact hypothesis megafauna was once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as new zealand and madagascar but is now almost exclusively found on the continent of africa with notable comparisons on australia and the islands previously mentioned experiences population crashes and trophic cascades shortly after the earliest human settlers1011 it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived as they evolved alongside humans9 the timing of south american megafaunal extinction does not appear to correspond to human arrival although the possibility of whether human activity at the time may have impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested9 it has been noted in the face of such evidence homo sapiens is unique in its ecology as an unprecedented global superpredator regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine apex predators and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide14 anthropogenic impact on climate during the holoceneedit in order to constitute the holocene as an extinction event scientists must determine exactly when anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions began to measurably alter natural atmospheric levels at a global scale and when these alterations caused changes to global climate employing chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores researchers have estimated the fluctuations of carbon dioxide c02 and methane gases ch4 in the earths atmosphere for the late pleistocene and holocene epochs34 based on these studies general argumentation of when the peak of the anthropocene occurred pertains to the timeframe within the previous two centuries typically beginning with the industrial revolution when greenhouse gas levels were recorded by contemporary methods at its highest3536 however scientists that are employing a variance of archaeological and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus not originating as early as the industrial revolution gaining popularity on his uncommon hypothesis palaeoclimatologist william ruddiman in 2003 stipulated that in the early holocene 11,000 years ago atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels has fluctuated at a different pattern than the pleistocene epoch before it343738 he argued that the patterns of the significant decline of co2 levels during the last ice age of the pleistocene inversely correlates to the holocene where there has been dramatic increases of co2 around 8000 years ago and ch4 levels 3000 years after that38 the correlation between the downfall of co2 in the pleistocene and the uprising of it during the holocene implies that the causation of this spark of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are due to the growth of human agriculture during the holocene such as the anthropogenic expansion of land and irrigation3438 recent extinctions described are well-documented but the nomenclature used varies18 the term anthropocene is a term that is used by few scientists and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction1839 the holoceneanthropocene boundary is contested with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the holocene epoch40 other commentators place the holoceneanthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions18 agricultureedit human civilization flourished in accordance to the efficiency and intensification of prevailing subsistence systems41 local communities that acquire more subsistence strategies increased in number to combat competitive pressures of land utilization3441 therefore the holocene developed competition on the basis of agriculture the growth of agriculture has then introduced newer means of climate change and pollution recent investigations about hunter-gatherer landscape burning has a major implication for the current debate about the timing of the anthropocene and the role that humans may have played in the production of greenhouse gases prior to the industrial revolution41 studies on early hunter-gatherers raises questions about the current use of population size or density as a proxy for the amount of land clearance and anthropogenic burning that took place in preindustrial times3742 scientists have questioned the correlation between population size and early territorial alterations42 ruddiman and ellis research paper in 2009 makes the case that early farmers involved in systems of agriculture used more land per capita than growers more later in the holocene who intensified their labor to produce more food per unit of area arguing that agricultural involvement in rice production implemented thousands of years ago by relatively small populations have created significant environmental impacts through large-scale means of deforestation41 while a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of ch4 and co2 deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally353841 climateedit climate change in the early holocene was distinguished prior to the last glacial maximum 15,000 years ago which then started the current period of the glacial retreat where climate started to increase significantly 11,000 years ago43 the holocene epoch contained a vast number of temperature fluctuations that can be dated from the warm period of the holocene climatic optimum in 5000 to 3000 bc that consisted of temperatures that were 1-2 degrees celsius warmer than today to the more recent emergence of the industrial revolution374445 during this period came the development of ancient civilizations of the earliest homo sapiens and the growth of agriculture due to the increase of tropical regions deepening the understanding of the anthropogenic impact in the early holocene is a vital factor for analyzing interglacial climate instability due to their involvement in producing of atmospheric carbon dioxide methodologies of the holocene climatic optimumedit to undermine the present and future human-induced climatic changes climatologists and paleontologists have correlated the increases of temperatures with the variations of solar radiation exposed to certain latitudinal earth bands during the early holocene46 thus believing that the holocene warming was solar in origin where only certain parts of the world experienced warmer climates during seasons such as summer moreover scientists have conducted numerous oceanic sediments that can be dated back to the holocene climatic optimum and discovered drastic increases of sea-levels and their sea-level highstands47 this evidence of drastic increases of sea levels indicates that the deterioration of ice cores is crucial to understanding how the holocene climatic optimum began and how it played as one of the major transgressions during the holocene maximum48 as speculations of how the holocene climatic optimum began remain scientifically unclear impurities in gaseous chemistry inside these ice cores have been conducted as a valuable method of obtaining evidence of abnormal temperature fluctuations49 the nile river showed to have a greater volume and much larger in the holocene than what it is today and the sahara to have been more fertile5051 this in turn led many anthropogenic hypotheses to claim that more tropical territories encouraged agricultural processes34 however there is greater complexity as to whether such changes are heavily caused by anthropogenic effects on climate because of limited methods that can directly identify an empirical correlation prehistoric extinctions 60,000 bce-3500 bceedit this section needs

glacial period can be attributed to human activities by hunting or even by slaughter56 of prey populations discoveries at monte verde in south america and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have caused a controversy57 regarding the clovis culture there likely would have been human settlements prior to the clovis culture and the history of humans in the americas may extend back many thousands of years before the clovis culture57 the amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated for example in wrangel island in siberia the extinction of dwarf woolly mammoths approximately 2000 bce58 did not coincide with the arrival of humans nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the south american continent although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed9 comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions approximately since the industrial revolution and the pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period the latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them we know that humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodon59 but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes widespread extinctions and climate changes78 the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans therefore the actions of the clovis people despite seeming insignificant by todays standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was

period of time707172 in a pair of studies published in 2015 extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that 7 of all species on earth may have been lost already64 megafaunal extinctions continue into the 21st century modern extinctions are more directly attributable to human influences extinction rates are minimized in the popular imagination by the survival of captive populations of animals that are extinct in the wild such as the pre davids deer hawaiian crow and by marginal survivals of highly publicized megafauna that are ecologically extinct such as the giant panda sumatran rhinoceros north american black-footed ferret however the holocene can also be characterisied by widespread extinctions among arthropods widespread local extinctions of

alan hicks of the new york state department of environmental conservation global warmingedit main articles extinction risk from global warming and ocean acidification global warming is widely accepted as being a contributor to extinction worldwide in a similar way that previous extinction events have generally included a rapid change in global climate and meteorology it is also expected to disrupt sex ratios in many reptiles which have temperature-dependent sex determination degradation of marine habitatsedit main articles ocean acidification overfishing and marine pollution the collapse of atlantic cod off the coast of newfoundland in 1992 as a result of overfishing the population never recovered completely altering the ecosystem and rendering the species locally extinct rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean increasing its acidity marine organisms which possess calcium carbonate shells or exoskeletons experience physiological pressure as the carbonate reacts with acid this is already resulting in coral bleaching on various coral reefs worldwide which provide valuable habitat for very high biodiversity marine gastropods bivalves and other invertebrates are also affected as are any organisms that feed on them fishing has had a devastating effect on marine organism populations for several centuries even before the explosion of destructive and highly effective fishing practices like trawling84 humans are unique among predators in that they regularly predate on other adult apex predators particularly in marine environments14 bluefin tuna and various sharks in particular are particularly vulnerable to predation pressure from human fishing pollinator declineedit main articles pollinator decline and colony collapse disorder
