the british empire and several have specifically voted to remain british territories bermuda in 1995 gibraltar in 2002 and the falkland islands in 2013.160 the crown dependencies are possessions of the crown as opposed to overseas territories of the uk161 they comprise three independently administered jurisdictions the channel islands of jersey and guernsey in the english channel and the isle of man in the irish sea by mutual agreement the british government manages the islands foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf however internationally they are regarded as territories for which the united kingdom is responsible162 the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies with the assent of the crown privy council or in the case of the isle of man in certain circumstances the lieutenant-governor163 since 2005 each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government164 the british dependencies use a varied assortment of currencies these include the british pound us dollar new zealand dollar euro or their own currencies which may be pegged to either politics main articles politics of the united kingdom monarchy of the united kingdom and elections in the united kingdom elizabeth ii is queen of the united kingdom and each of the other commonwealth realms the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy queen elizabeth ii is the head of state of the uk as well as monarch of fifteen other independent commonwealth countries the monarch has the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn165 the constitution of the united kingdom is uncodified and consists mostly of a collection of disparate written sources including statutes judge-made case law and international treaties together with constitutional conventions166 as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and constitutional law the uk parliament can perform constitutional reform simply by passing acts of parliament and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution however no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change167 government main article government of the united kingdom the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world a legacy of the british empire the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses an elected house of commons and an appointed house of lords all bills passed are given royal assent before becoming law the position of prime ministernote 13 the uks head of government168 belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of the house of commons this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber the prime minister chooses a cabinet and its members are formally appointed by the monarch to form her majestys government by convention the monarch respects the prime ministers decisions of government169 the palace of westminster seat of both houses of the parliament of the united kingdom the cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the prime ministers party or coalition and mostly from the house of commons but always from both legislative houses the cabinet being responsible to both executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet all of whom are sworn into the privy council of the united kingdom and become ministers of the crown the current prime minister is theresa may who has been in office since 13 july 2016 may is also the leader of the conservative party for elections to the house of commons the uk is divided into 650 constituencies170 each electing a single member of parliament mp by simple plurality general elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises prior to the fixed-term parliaments act 2011 the parliament acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election171 the conservative party the labour party and the liberal democrats formerly as the liberal party have in modern times been considered the uks three major political parties172 representing the british traditions of conservatism socialism and social liberalism respectively however at the 2015 general election the scottish national party became the third-largest party by number of seats won ahead of the liberal democrats most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk plaid cymru wales only and the democratic unionist party ulster unionist party social democratic and labour party and sinn fin northern ireland onlynote 14.173 in accordance with party policy no elected sinn fin members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch174 devolved administrations main articles devolution in the united kingdom northern ireland executive scottish government and welsh government the scottish parliament building in holyrood is the seat of the scottish parliament scotland wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive led by a first minister or in the case of northern ireland a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister and a devolved unicameral legislature england the largest country of the united kingdom has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uks government and parliament on all issues this situation has given rise to the so-called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland wales and northern ireland can vote sometimes decisively175 on matters that only affect england176 the mckay commission reported on this matter in march 2013 recommending that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament177 the scottish government and parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament including education healthcare scots law and local government178 at the 2011 elections the scottish national party won re-election and achieved an overall majority in the scottish parliament with its leader alex salmond as first minister of scotland179180 in 2012 the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in 2014 which was defeated 55 to 45 the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland181 the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly which require no prior consent from westminster the 2011 elections resulted in a minority labour administration led by carwyn jones182 the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly arlene foster democratic unionist party and martin mcguinness sinn fin are first minister and deputy first minister respectively183 devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north-south ministerial council where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland the british and irish governments co-operate on non-devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the britishirish intergovernmental conference which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non-operation the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland wales or northern ireland under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty the uk parliament could in theory therefore abolish the scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly184185 indeed in 1972 the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions186 in practice it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions187 the political constraints placed upon the uk parliaments power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland188 law and criminal justice main article law of the united kingdom the royal courts of justice of england and wales the united kingdom does not have a single legal system as article 19 of the 1706 treaty

and northern ireland law are based on common-law principles193 the essence of common law is that subject to statute the law is developed by judges in courts applying statute precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles which are reported and binding in future similar cases stare decisis194 the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales consisting of the court of appeal the high court of justice for civil cases and the crown court for criminal cases the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions195 the high court of justiciarythe supreme criminal court of scotland scots law is a hybrid system based on both common-law and civil-law principles the chief courts are the court of session for civil cases196 and the high court of justiciary for criminal cases197 the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law198 sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury known as sheriff solemn court or with a sheriff and no jury known as sheriff summary court199 the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial guilty not guilty and not proven both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal200 crime

iias well as many colonial conflicts by emerging victorious from such conflicts britain has often been able to decisively influence world events since the end of the british empire the uk has nonetheless remained a major military power following the end of the cold war defence policy has a stated assumption that the most demanding operations will be undertaken as part of a coalition215 setting aside the intervention in sierra leone recent uk military operations in bosnia kosovo afghanistan iraq and most recently libya have followed this approach the last time the british military

and the scottish parliament is subordinate the white paper had indicated that this was to be the approach taken in the legislation the scottish parliament is not to be seen as a reflection of the settled will of the people of scotland or of popular sovereignty but as a reflection of its subordination to a higher legal authority following the logic of this argument the power of the scottish parliament to legislate can be withdrawn or overridden elliot m 2004 united kingdom parliamentary sovereignty under pressure international journal of constitutional law 2 3 545627 pp 553554 doi101093icon23545 notwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes an important common factor is that the uk parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned for example the scottish parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied but this power to legislate on what may be termed devolved matters is concurrent with the westminster parliaments general power to legislate for scotland on any matter at all including devolved matters in theory

the welsh assembly by a simple majority vote in both houses but since both were sanctioned by referenda it would be politically difficult to abolish them without the sanction of a further vote by the

involvement of two governments in the northern irish problem means that northern irelands new arrangements rest upon an intergovernmental agreement if this can be equated with a treaty it could be argued that the forthcoming distribution of power between westminster and belfast has similarities with divisions specified in the written constitutions of federal states although the agreement makes the general proviso that westminsters powers to make legislation for northern ireland remains unaffected without an explicit categorical reference to reserved matters it may be more difficult than in scotland or wales for devolved powers to be repatriated the retraction of devolved powers would not merely entail consultation in northern ireland backed implicitly by the absolute power of
