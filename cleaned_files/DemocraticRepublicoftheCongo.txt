catch giant river catfish1718 some historians think that bantu peoples began settling in the extreme northwest of central africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward their propagation was accelerated by the transition from stone age to iron age techniques the people living in the south and southwest were mostly san bushmen and hunter-gatherer groups whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies the development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry this led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast the 10th century marked the final expansion of the bantu in west-central africa rising populations soon made possible intricate

the sponsorship of king leopold ii of belgium the eastern regions of the precolonial congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding mainly from arabswahili slave traders such as the infamous tippu tip19 who was well known to stanley leopold had designs on what was to become the congo as a colony20 in a succession of negotiations leopold professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization association internationale africaine actually played one european rival against anothercitation needed leopold formally acquired rights to the congo territory at the conference of berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property he named it the congo free state20 leopolds rgime began various infrastructure projects such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville now kinshasa which took eight years to complete nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which leopold and his associates could extract from the colony21 in the free state colonists brutalized the local population into producing rubber for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market rubber sales made a fortune for leopold who built several buildings in brussels and ostend to honor himself and his country to enforce the rubber quotas the army the force publique was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy22 during the period of 18851908 millions of congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease in some areas the population declined dramatically it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas

through trapping usually with wire snares or else with shotguns poisoned arrows or arms originally intended for use in the drcs numerous military conflictscitation needed the bushmeat crisis emerged mainly as a result of the poor living conditions of the congolese people and a lack of education about the dangers of eating it a rising population combined with deplorable economic conditions made many congolese dependent on bushmeat either as an income source selling the meat or for food unemployment and urbanization throughout central africa have exacerbated the problem further by turning cities like the urban sprawl of kinshasa into prime markets for commercial bushmeatcitation needed this combination has caused widespread endangerment of local fauna and has forced humans to trudge deeper into the wilderness in search of the desired animal meat this overhunting results in the deaths of more animals and makes resources even more scarce for humans the hunting has also been facilitated by the extensive logging prevalent throughout the congos rainforests from both corporate logging and farmers clearing forest landfor agriculture logging allows hunters much easier access
