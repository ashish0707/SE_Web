although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by amos g throop in 1891 the college attracted influential scientists such as george ellery hale arthur amos noyes and robert andrews millikan in the early 20th century the vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1921 in 1934 caltech was elected to the association of american universities and the antecedents of nasas jet propulsion laboratory which caltech continues to manage and operate were established between 1936 and 1943 under theodore von krmn78 the university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the united states which tends to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering managing 332 million in 2011 in sponsored research9 its 124-acre 50ha primary campus is located approximately 11mi 18km northeast of downtown los angeles first-year students are required to live on campus and 95 of undergraduates remain in the on-campus house system at caltech although caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks10 student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations the caltech beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the ncaa division iiis

institute pasadena california 1908 on its original campus at downtown pasadena caltech started as a vocational school founded in pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician amos g throop the school was known successively as throop university throop polytechnic institute and manual training school14 and throop college of technology before acquiring its current name in 1920.915 the vocational school was disbanded and the preparatory program was split off to form an independent polytechnic school in 1907 at a time when scientific research in the united states was still in its infancy george ellery hale a solar astronomer from the university of chicago founded the mount wilson observatory in 1904 he joined throops board of trustees in 1907 and soon began developing it and the whole of pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination he engineered the appointment of james a b scherer a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser to throops presidency in 1908 scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee charles w gates to donate 25,000 in seed money to build gates laboratory the first science building on campus16 world warsedit in 1910 throop moved to its current site arther fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site theodore roosevelt delivered an address at throop institute on march 21 1911 and he declared i want to see institutions like throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them i want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the panama canal and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this countryand the one-hundredth man i want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer george ellery hale17 throop hall 1912 in the same year a bill was introduced in the california legislature calling for the establishment of a publicly funded california institute of technology with an initial budget of a million dollars ten times the budget of throop at the time the board of trustees offered to turn throop over to the state but the presidents of stanford university and the university of california successfully lobbied to defeat the bill which allowed throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern california public or private until the onset of the world war ii necessitated the broader development of research-based science education18 the promise of throop attracted physical chemist arthur amos noyes from mit to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology with the onset of world war i hale organized the national research council to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems while he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges and instead sought to raise a 1 million national research fund entirely from private sources to that end as hale wrote in the new york times throop college of technology in pasadena california has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the research council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation this institution with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation president scherer hearing of the formation of the council immediately offered to take part in its work and with this object he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars19 through the national research council hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs and for throop to play a national role in science the new funds were designated for physics research and ultimately led to the establishment of the norman bridge laboratory which attracted experimental physicist robert andrews millikan from the university of chicago in 1917.20 during the course of the war hale noyes and millikan worked together in washington on the nrc subsequently they continued their partnership in developing caltech19 caltech entrance at 1200 e california blvd on the left is east norman bridge laboratory of physics and on the right is the alfred sloan laboratory of mathematics and physics under the leadership of hale noyes and millikan aided by the booming economy of southern california caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of roosevelts hundredth man on november 29 1921 the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics physics and chemistry broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as english history and economics and vitalizing all the work of the institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research17 in 1923 millikan was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1925 the school established a department of geology and hired william bennett munro then chairman of the division of history government and economics at harvard university to create a division of humanities and social sciences at caltech in 1928 a division of biology was established under the leadership of thomas hunt morgan the most distinguished biologist in the united states at the time and discoverer of the role of genes and the chromosome in heredity in 1930 kerckhoff marine laboratory was established in corona del mar under the care of professor george macginitie in 1926 a graduate school of aeronautics was created which eventually attracted theodore von krmn krmn later helped create the jet propulsion laboratory and played an integral part in establishing caltech as one of the worlds centers for rocket science in 1928 construction of the palomar observatory began richard c tolman and albert einstein at caltech 1932 millikan served as chairman of the executive council effectively caltechs president from 1921 to 1945 and his influence was such that the institute was occasionally referred to as millikans school millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining caltech scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as paul dirac erwin schrdinger werner heisenberg hendrik lorentz and niels bohr21 albert einstein arrived on the caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his theory of general relativity and he returned to caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.22 during world war ii caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the v-12 navy college training program which offered students a path to a navy commission23 the united states navy also maintained a naval training school for aeronautical engineering resident inspectors of ordnance and naval material and a liaison officer to the national defense research committee on campus24 post-war growthedit beckman institute at caltech in the 1950s1970s caltech was the home of murray gell-mann and richard feynman whose work was central to the establishment of the standard model of particle physics feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful unconventional character during lee a dubridges tenure as caltechs president 19461969 caltechs faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size dubridge unlike his predecessors welcomed federal funding of science new research fields flourished including chemical biology planetary science nuclear astrophysics and geochemistry a 200-inch telescope was dedicated on nearby palomar mountain in 1948 and remained the worlds most powerful optical telescope for over forty years25 caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of harold brown in 1970 and they made up 14 of the entering class26 the fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then4 caltech undergraduates have historically been so apathetic to politicscitation neededweaselwords that there has been only one organized student protest in january 1968 outside the burbank studios of nbc in response to rumors that nbc was to cancel star trek in 1973 the students from dabney house protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase impeach nixon the following week ross mccollum president of the national oil company wrote an open letter to dabney house stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to caltech the dabney family being republicans disowned dabney house after hearing of the prank27 21st

of albert einstein and from other collections the new annenberg center for information science and technology in fall 2008 the freshman class was 42 female a record for caltechs undergraduate enrollment4 in the same year the institute concluded a six-year-long fund-raising campaign the campaign raised more than 1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors nearly half of the funds went into the support of caltech programs and projects29 in 2010 caltech in partnership with lawrence berkeley national laboratory and headed by professor nathan lewis established a doe energy innovation hub aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight this hub the joint center for artificial photosynthesis will receive up to 122 million in federal funding over five years30

two locations are frequent getaways for caltech students in 1917 hale hired architect bertram goodhue to produce a master plan for the 22 acres 8.9ha campus goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building dabney hall and several other structures in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate the character of the school and hales educational philosophy goodhues designs for caltech were also influenced by the traditional spanish mission architecture of southern california in 1971 a magnitude-66 earthquake in san fernando caused some damage to the caltech campus engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the institutethroop hall and the goodhue-designed culbertson auditoriumhad cracked these were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings and their plans did not contain enough details such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete to be sure they were safe so the engineers recommended demolition however demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse a large wrecking ball was used to demolish throop hall and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar far in excess of safety requirements the rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away and the process took much longer than expected new additions to the campus include the cahill center for astronomy and astrophysics and the walter and leonore annenberg center for information science and technology which opened in 2009,3334 and the warren and katherine schlinger laboratory for chemistry and chemical engineering followed in march 2010.35 the institute

engineering mechanical engineering and physics68 prior to the entering class of 2017 caltech requires students to take a core curriculum of three terms of mathematics three terms of physics two terms of chemistry one term of biology two terms of lab courses one terms of scientific communication three terms of physical education and 12 terms of humanities and social science69 breezeway of arms laboratory a typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options degree requirements students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term more than four classes in order to graduate in four years 36 units is the minimum full-time load 48 units is considered a heavy load and registrations above 54 units require an overload petition70 approximately 20 percent of students double-major71 this is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major although choosing two options in the same division is discouraged it is still possible first-year students are enrolled in first-term classes based upon results of placement exams in math physics chemistry and writing and take all classes in their first two terms on a passfail basis70 there is little competition collaboration on homework is encouraged and the honor system encourages take-home

reference to the famous millikan oil-drop experiment which measured e the elemental unit of electrical charge the beckman auditorium on ditch day the seniors ditch school leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical electrical and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen each group of seniors designs a stack to be solved by a handful of underclassmen the faculty have been drawn into the event as well and cancel all classes on ditch day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year another long-standing tradition is the playing of wagners ride of the valkyries at 700 each morning during finals week with the largest loudest speakers available the playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of the ring cycle and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed the playing of the ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during apollo 17 to awaken astronaut harrison schmitt a caltech alumnus unfortunately the tradition arose at different times in different houses so schmitt did not react as expected instead he just became confusedcitation needed pranksedit the fleming cannon caltech students have been known for the many pranks also known as rfs108 the two most famous in recent history are the changing of the hollywood sign to read caltech by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters and the changing of the scoreboard to read caltech 38 mit 9 during the 1984 rose bowl game but the most famous of all occurred during the 1961 rose bowl game where caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display caltech and several other unintended messages this event is now referred to as the great rose bowl hoax in recent years pranking has been officially encouraged by tom mannion caltechs assistant vp for student affairs and campus life the grand old days of pranking have gone away at caltech and thats what we are trying to bring back reported the boston globe109 in december 2011 caltech students went to new york and pulled a prank on manhattans greenwich village the prank involved making the cube sculpture look like the aperture science weighted companion cube from the video game portal110 caltech pranks have been documented in three legends of caltech books the most recent of which was edited by alumni autumn looijen 99 and mason a porter 98 and published in may 2007 rivalry with mitedit main article caltechmit rivalry in 2005 a group of caltech students pulled a string of pranks during mits campus preview weekend for admitted students these include covering up the word massachusetts in the massachusetts institute of technology engraving on the main building faade with a banner so that it read that other institute of technology a group of mit hackers responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read the only institute of technology caltech students also passed out t-shirts to mits incoming freshman class that had mit written on the front and  because not everyone can go to caltech along with an image of a palm tree on the back mit retaliated in april 2006 when students posing as the howe ser howitzer moving company stole the 130-year-old 1.7-ton fleming house cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in cambridge massachusetts for their 2006 campus preview weekend repeating a similar prank performed by nearby harvey mudd college in 1986 thirty members of fleming house traveled to mit and reclaimed their cannon on april 10 2006 on april 13 2007 friday the 13th a group of students from the california tech caltechs campus newspaper arrived and distributed fake copies of the tech mits campus newspaper while prospective students were visiting for their campus preview weekend articles included mit invents the interweb architects deem campus unfortunate and infinite corridor not actually infinite in december 2009 some caltech students declared that mit had been sold and had become the caltech east campus a sold banner was hung on front of the mit dome building and a welcome to caltech east school of the humanities banner over the massachusetts avenue entrance newspapers and t-shirts were distributed and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the curriculum change111112 in september 2010 mit students attempted to put a tardis the time machine from the bbcs doctor who onto a roof caught in midact the prank was aborted in january 2011 caltech students in conjunction with mit students helped put the tardis on top of baxter113 caltech students then moved the tardis to uc berkeley114 and stanford115 in april 2014 during mits campus preview weekend a group of caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the mit logo on the front and the words the institute of technology on the back when heated the mugs turn orange display a palm tree and read caltech the hotter institute of technology identical mugs continue to be sold at the caltech campus store116 honor codeedit life in the caltech community is governed by the honor code which simply states no member of the caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the caltech community this is enforced by a board of control which consists of undergraduate students117 and by a similar body at the graduate level called the graduate honor council118 the honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere for example the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment through the late 1990s the only exception to the honor code implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations concerned the sexual harassment policy today there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy and alcohol policy though both policies are presented in the honor system handbook given to new members of the caltech community some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community119 peopleedit main article list of california institute of technology people as of 2015 caltech has 34 nobel laureates to its name this figure includes 20 alumni 14 non-alumni professors and 4 professors who are also alumni carl d anderson linus pauling william a fowler and edward b lewis the number of awards is 35 because pauling received prizes in both chemistry and peace seven faculty and alumni have received a crafoord prize from the royal swedish academy of sciences while 58 have been awarded the us national medal of science and 13 have received the national medal of technology4 one alumnus stanislav smirnov won the fields medal in 2010 other distinguished researchers have been affiliated with caltech as postdoctoral scholars for example barbara mcclintock james d watson sheldon glashow and john gurdon or visiting professors for example albert einstein stephen hawking and edward witten studentsedit demographics of caltech student body 2016175 undergraduate graduate

center for biological sciences richard feynman was among the most well-known physicists associated with caltech having published the feynman lectures on physics an undergraduate physics text and a few other popular science texts such as six easy pieces for the general audience the promotion of physics made him a public figure of science although his nobel-winning work in quantum electrodynamics was already very established in the scientific community murray gell-mann a nobel-winning physicist introduced a classification of hadrons and went on to postulate the existence of quarks which is currently accepted as part of the standard model long-time caltech president robert andrews millikan was the first to calculate the charge of the electron with his well-known oil-drop experiment while richard chace tolman is remembered for his contributions to cosmology and statistical mechanics 2004 nobel prize in physics winner h david politzer is a current professor at caltech as is astrophysicist and author kip thorne and eminent mathematician barry simon linus pauling pioneered quantum chemistry and molecular biology and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939 seismologist charles richter also an alumnus developed the magnitude scale that bears his name the richter magnitude scale for measuring the power of earthquakes one of the founders of the geochemistry department clair patterson was the first to accurately determine the age of the earth via leaduranium ratio in meteorites in engineering theodore von krmn made many key advances in aerodynamics notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization a repeating pattern of swirling vortices is named after him the von krmn vortex street participants in von krmns galcit project included frank malina who helped develop the wac corporal which was the first us rocket to reach the edge of space jack parsons a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor and qian xuesen who was dubbed the father of chinese rocketry more recently michael brown a professor of planetary astronomy discovered many trans-neptunian objects most notably the dwarf planet eris which prompted the international astronomical union to redefine the term planet david baltimore the robert a millikan

companies of fairchild semiconductor include national semiconductor and advanced micro devices which in turn spawned more technology companies in the area shockleys decision to use silicon instead of germanium as the semiconductor material coupled with the abundance of silicon semiconductor related companies in the area gave rise to the term silicon valley142 to describe that geographic region
