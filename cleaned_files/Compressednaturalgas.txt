gasoline petrol diesel fuel and propanelpg cng combustion produces fewer undesirable gases than the fuels mentioned above it is safer than other fuels in the event of a spill because natural gas is lighter than air and disperses quickly when released cng may be found above oil deposits or may be collected from landfills or wastewater treatment plants where it is known as biogas cng is made by compressing natural gas which is mainly composed of methane ch4 to less than 1 percent of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure it is stored and distributed in hard containers at a pressure of 2025mpa 2,9003,600psi usually in cylindrical or spherical shapes cng is used in traditional gasolineinternal combustion engine automobiles that have been modified or in vehicles which were manufactured for cng use either alone dedicated with a segregated gasoline system to extend range dual fuel or in conjunction with another fuel such as diesel bi-fuel natural gas vehicles are increasingly used in iran especially pakistan1 the asia-pacific region indian capital of delhi and other large cities like ahmedabad mumbai pune kolkataas well as cities such as lucknow kanpur etc its use is also increasing in south america europe and north america because of rising gasoline prices2 in response to high fuel prices and environmental concerns cng is starting to be used also in tuk-tuks and pickup trucks transit and school buses and trains the cost and placement of fuel storage tanks is the major barrier to widerquicker adoption of cng as a fuel it is also why municipal government public transportation vehicles were the most visible early adopters of it as they can more quickly amortize the money invested in the new and usually cheaper fuel in spite of these circumstances the number of vehicles in the world using cng has grown steadily 30 percent per year3 now as a result of the industrys steady growth the cost of such fuel storage tanks has been brought down to a much more acceptable level especially for the cng type 1 and type 2 tanks many countries are able to make reliable and cost effective tanks for conversion need4 cngs volumetric energy

gasolinecng vehicle authorized shops can do the retrofitting and involves installing a cng cylinder plumbing a cng injection system and the electronics the cost of installing a cng conversion kit7 can often reach 8,000 on passenger cars and light trucks and is usually reserved for vehicles that travel many miles each year cng costs about 50 less than gasoline and emits up to 90 fewer emissions than gasoline8 locomotivesedit cng locomotives are operated by several railroads the napa valley wine train successfully retrofit a diesel locomotive to run on compressed natural gas before 2002.9 this converted locomotive was upgraded to utilize a computer controlled fuel injection system in may 2008 and is now the napa valley wine trains primary locomotive10 ferrocarril central andino in peru has run a cng locomotive on a freight line since 2005.11 vtkovice machinery group in czech republic starts to operate new cng locomotive at 2014 it s based on ckd chassis 714 fully restored by cz loko and fitted with cat 3412 engine reworked by marat engineering the engine has fully electronic engine control system including electronically controlled ignition and multipoint fuel blowing and torque mapping cng locomotives are usually diesel locomotives that have been converted to use compressed natural gas generators instead of diesel generators to generate the electricity that drives the traction motors some cng locomotives are able to fire their cylinders only when there is a demand for power which theoretically gives them a higher fuel efficiency than conventional diesel engines cng is also cheaper than petrol or diesel advantagesedit cng powered bus in madrid spain being refueled cng-powered vehicles have lower maintenance costs than other hydrocarbon-fuel-powered vehicles cng fuel systems are sealed preventing fuel losses from spills or evaporation increased life of lubricating oils as cng does not contaminate and dilute the crankcase oil being a gaseous fuel cng mixes easily and evenly in air cng is less likely to ignite on hot surfaces since it has a high auto-ignition temperature 540c and a narrow range 515 percent of flammability12 cng-powered vehicles are considered to be safer than gasoline-powered vehicles131415 less pollution and more efficiency cng emits significantly less pollution directly than gasoline or oil when combusted eg carbon dioxide co2 unburned hydrocarbons uhc carbon monoxide co nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox and pm particulate matter for example an engine running on petrol for 100km emits 22kilograms of co2 while covering the same distance on cng emits only 16.3kilograms of co216bettersourceneeded due to lower carbon dioxide emissions switching to cng can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions12 however natural gas leaks both in the direct use and in the production and delivery of the fuel represent an increase in greenhouse gas emissions the ability of cng to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the entire fuel lifecycle will depend on the source of the natural gas and the fuel it is replacing the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for cng compressed from californias pipeline natural gas is given a value of 67.70grams of co2-equivalent per megajoule gco2emj by carb the california air resources board approximately 28 percent lower than the average gasoline fuel in that market 95.86 gco2emj cng produced from landfill biogas was found by carb to have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any fuel analyzed with a value of 11.26 gco2emj more than 88 percent lower than conventional gasoline in the low-carbon fuel standard that went into effect on january 12 2010.17 drawbacksedit compressed natural gas vehicles require a greater amount of space for fuel storage than conventional gasoline powered vehicles since it is a compressed gas rather than a liquid like gasoline cng takes up more space for each gge gasoline gallon equivalent however the tanks used to store the cng take up space in the trunk of a car or bed of a pickup truck which has been modified to additionally run on cng this problem is solved in factory-built cng vehicles that install the tanks under the body of the vehicle leaving the trunk free eg fiat multipla new fiat panda volkswagen touran ecofuel volkswagen caddy ecofuel chevy taxi - which sold in countries such as peru another option is installation on roof typical on buses requiring however solution of structural strength issues in 2014 a test by the danish technological institute of euro6 heavy vehicles on cng and diesel showed that cng had higher consumption but same noise and pollution of co2 and particulates however nox emission was lower18 codes and standardsedit the lack of harmonized codes and standards across international jurisdictions is an additional barrier to ngv market penetration19 the international organization for standardization has an active technical committee working on a standard for natural gas fuelling stations for vehicles20 despite the lack of harmonized international codes natural gas vehicles have an excellent global safety record existing international standards include iso 14469-22007 which applies to cng vehicle nozzles and receptacle21 and iso 15500-92012 specifies tests and requirements for the pressure regulator22 nfpa-52 covers natural gas vehicle safety standards in the us comparison with other natural gas fuelsedit compressed natural gas is often confused with lng liquefied natural gas both are stored forms of natural gas the main difference is that cng is stored at ambient temperature and high pressure while lng is stored at low temperature and nearly ambient pressure in their respective storage conditions lng is a liquid and cng is a supercritical fluid cng has a lower cost of production and storage compared to lng as it does not require an expensive cooling process and cryogenic tanks however cng requires a much larger volume to store the energy equivalent of gasoline or petrol and the use of very high pressures 3000 to 4000 psi or 205 to 275 bar as a consequence of this lng is often used for transporting natural gas over large distances in ships trains or pipelines where the gas is converted into cng before distribution to the end user cng is being experimentally stored at lower pressure in a form known as an ang adsorbed natural gas tank at 35 bar 500 psi the pressure of gas in natural gas pipelines in various sponge like materials such as activated carbon23 and mofs metal-organic frameworks24 the fuel is stored at similar or greater energy density than cng this means that vehicles can be refueled from the natural gas network without extra gas compression the fuel tanks can be slimmed down and made of lighter weaker materials compressed natural gas is sometimes mixed with hydrogen hcng which increases the hc ratio hydrogencarbon ratio of the fuel and gives it a flame speed up to eight times higher than cng25 worldwideedit iran pakistan argentina

according to channel newsasia and north korea state television on april 18 2008 more owners of private cars in this country are converting their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on cng motivated no doubt by rising petrol prices the initial cost of converting a regular vehicle to dual fuel at the german conversion workshop of c melchers for example is around s3800 with the promise of real cost-savings that dual-fuel vehicles bring over the long term singapore currently has five operating filling stations for natural gas sembcorp gas pte ltd runs the station on jurong island and jointly

initiative will end at the end of 2012 as the government believes the critical mass of cng vehicles would then have been built up the ministry of transport of myanmar passed a law in 2005 which required that all public transport vehicles - buses trucks and taxis be converted to run on cng the government permitted several private companies to handle the conversion of existing diesel and petrol cars and also to begin importing cng variants of buses and taxis accidents and rumours of accidents partly fueled by myanmars position in local hydrocarbon politics30 has discouraged citizens from using cng vehicles although now almost every taxi and public bus in yangon myanmars largest city run on cng cng stations have been set up around yangon and other cities but electricity shortages mean that vehicles may have to queue up for hours to fill their gas containers31 the burmese opposition movements are against the conversion to cng as they accuse the companies as being proxies of the junta and also that the petrodollars earned by the regime would go towards the defense sector rather than towards improving the infrastructure or welfare of the people in malaysia the use of cng was originally introduced for taxicabs and airport limousines during the late-1990s when new taxis were launched with cng engines while taxicab operators were encouraged to send in existing taxis for full engine conversions the practice of using cng remained largely confined to taxicabs predominantly in the klang valley and penang due to a lack of interest no incentives were offered for those besides taxicab owners to use cng engines while government subsidies on petrol and diesel made conventional road vehicles cheaper to use in the eyes of the consumers petronas malaysias state-owned oil company also monopolises the provision of cng to road users as of july 2008 petronas only operates about 150 cng refueling stations most of which are concentrated in the klang valley at the same time another 50 were expected by the end of 2008.32 as fuel subsidies were gradually removed in malaysia starting june 5 2008 the subsequent 41 percent price hike on petrol and diesel led to a 500 percent increase in the number of new cng tanks installed3334 national car maker proton considered fitting its waja saga and persona models with cng kits from prins autogassystemen by the end of 2008,35 while a local distributor of locally assembled hyundai cars offers new models with cng kits36 conversion centres which also benefited from the rush for lower running costs also perform partial conversions to existing road vehicles allowing them to run on both petrol or diesel and cng with a cost varying between rm3500 to rm5000 for passenger cars3337 a cng powered bus in beijing cng buses in beijing were introduced in late 1998 in china companies such as sino-energy are active in expanding the footprint of cng filling stations in medium-size cities across the interior of the country where at least two natural gas pipelines are operationalcitation needed in pakistan the karachi government under the order of supreme court in 2004 made it mandatory for all city buses and auto rickshaws to run on cng with the intention of reducing air pollution in pakistan in 2012 the federal government announced plans to gradually phase out cng over a period of approximately three years given natural gas shortages which have been negatively affecting the manufacturing sector38 aside from limiting electricity generation capacity gas shortages in pakistan have also raised the costs of business for key industries including the fertilizer cement and textile sectors39 iran has one of the largest fleets of cng vehicles and cng distribution networks in the world there are 2335 cng fueling stations with a total of 13,534 cng nozzles40 the number of cng burning vehicles in iran exceeds 3.5 million cng consumption by irans transportation sector is around 20 million cubic meters per day41 africaedit egypt is amongst the top 10 countries in cng adoption with 128,754 cng vehicles and 124 cng fueling stations egypt was also the first nation in africa and the middle east to open a public cng fueling station in january 1996.42 the vast majority 780000 have been produced as dual fuel vehicles by the auto manufacturer in the last two years and the remainder have been converted utilizing after market conversion kits in workshops there are 750 active refueling stations country wide with an additional 660 refueling stations under construction and expected to come on stream currently the major problem facing the industry as a whole is the building of refueling stations that is lagging behind dual fuel vehicle production forcing many to use petrol instead nigeria cng started with a pilot
