learn how and when to remove this template message a landfill in poland a landfill site also known as a tip dump rubbish dump garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden1 is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and is the oldest form of waste treatment although the burial part is modern historically refuse was just left in piles or thrown into pits historically landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world some landfills are also used for waste management purposes such as the temporary storage consolidation and transfer or processing of waste material sorting treatment or recycling a landfill also may refer to ground that has been filled in with rocks instead of waste materialscitation needed so that it can be used for a specific purpose such as for building houses unless they are stabilized these areas may experience severe shaking or soil liquefaction of the

operationsedit one of several landfills used by dryden ontario canada typically operators of well-run landfills for non-hazardous waste meet predefined specifications by applying techniques to confine waste to as small an area as possible compact waste to reduce volume cover waste usually daily with layers of soil during landfill operations a scale or weighbridge may weigh waste-collection vehicles on arrival and personnel may inspect loads for wastes that do not accord with the landfills waste-acceptance criteria afterward the waste-collection vehicles use the existing road network on their way to the tipping face or working front where they unload their contents after loads are deposited compactors or bulldozers can spread and compact the waste on the working face before leaving the landfill boundaries the waste collection vehicles may pass through a wheel-cleaning facility if necessary they return to the weighbridge for re-weighing without their load the weighing process can assemble statistics on the daily incoming waste-tonnage which databases can retain for record keeping in addition to trucks some landfills may have equipment to handle railroad containers the use of rail-haul permits landfills to be located at more remote sites without the problems associated with many truck trips typically in the working face the compacted waste is covered with soil or alternative materials daily alternative waste-cover materials include chipped wood or other green waste2 several sprayed-on foam products chemically fixed bio-solids and temporary blankets blankets can be lifted into place at night and then removed the following day prior to waste placement the space that is occupied daily by the compacted waste and the cover material is called a daily cell waste compaction is critical to extending the life of the landfill factors such as waste compressibility waste-layer thickness and the number of passes of the compactor over the waste affect the waste densities advantagesedit landfills are often the most cost-efficient way to dispose of waste especially in countries like the united states with large open spaces while resource recovery and incineration both require extensive investments in infrastructure and material recovery also requires extensive manpower to maintain landfills have fewer fixedor ongoingcosts allowing them to compete favorably in addition landfill gas can be upgraded to natural gaslandfill gas utilizationwhich is a potential revenue stream3 social and environmental impactedit landfill operation in hawaii note that the area being filled is a single well-defined cell and that a protective landfill liner is in place exposed on the left to prevent contamination by leachates migrating downward through the underlying geological formation landfills have the potential to cause a number of issues infrastructure disruption such as damage to access roads by heavy vehicles may occur pollution of local roads and water courses from wheels on vehicles when they leave the landfill can be significant and can be mitigated by wheel washing systems pollution of the local environment such as contamination of groundwater or aquifers or soil contamination may occur as well leachateedit main article leachate extensive efforts are made to capture and treat leachate from landfills before it reaches groundwater aquifers but engineered liners always have a lifespan though it may be 100 years or more eventually every landfill liner will leak4 allowing the leachate to contaminate the groundwater installation of composite liners with flexible membrane and soil barrier is enforced by the epa to ensure that leachate is withheld 5 dangerous gasesedit methane is naturally generated by decaying organic wastes in a landfill it is a potent greenhouse gas and can itself be a danger because it is flammable and potentially explosive in properly managed landfills gas is collected and utilized this could range from simple flaring to landfill gas utilization infectionsedit poorly run landfills may become nuisances because of vectors such as rats and flies which can cause infectious diseases the occurrence of such vectors can be mitigated through the use of daily cover other potential issues include wildlife disruption dust odor noise pollution and reduced local property values landfill gasedit main article landfill gas gases are produced in landfills due to the anaerobic digestion by microbes in a properly managed landfill this gas is collected and used its uses range from simple flaring to the landfill gas utilization and generation of electricity landfill gas monitoring alerts workers to the presence of a build-up of gases to a harmful level in some countries landfill gas recovery is extensive in the united states for example more than 850 landfills have active landfill gas recovery systems6 regional practiceedit the examples and perspective in this section may not represent a worldwide view

obliged to enact legislation to comply with the requirements and obligations of the european landfill directive in the uk this is the waste implementation programme united kingdomedit main article landfills in the united kingdom landfilling practices in the uk have had to change in recent years to meet the challenges of the european landfill directive the uk now imposes landfill tax upon biodegradable waste which is put into landfills in addition to this the landfill allowance trading scheme has been established for local authorities to trade landfill quotas in england a different system operates in wales where authorities are not able to trade between themselves but have allowances known as the landfill allowance scheme united statesedit main article landfills in the united states us landfills are regulated by each states environmental agency which establishes minimum guidelines however none of these standards may fall below those set by the united states environmental protection agency epa permitting a landfill generally takes between 5 and 7 years costs millions of dollars and requires rigorous siting engineering and environmental studies and demonstrations to ensure local environmental and safety concerns are satisfied9 microbial topicsedit the status of a landfills microbial community may determine its digestive efficiency10 bacteria that digest plastic have been found in landfills11 reclaiming materialsedit main article landfill mining landfills can be regarded as a viable and abundant source of materials and energy in the developing world waste pickers often scavenge for still-usable materials in a commercial context landfill sites have also been discovered by companies and many have begun harvesting materials and energy 12 well known examples are gas recovery facilities13 other commercial facilities include waste incinerators which have built-in material recovery this material recovery is possible through the use of filters electro filter active carbon and potassium filter quench hcl-washer so2-washer bottom ash-grating etc alternativesedit see also list of solid waste treatment technologies in addition to waste reduction and recycling strategies there are various alternatives to landfills including waste-to-energy incineration anaerobic digestion composting mechanical biological treatment pyrolysis and plasma arc gasification which have all begun to establish themselves in the market depending on local economics and incentives these can be made more financially attractive than landfills
