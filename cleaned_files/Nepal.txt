soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing they were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries thus began the reputation of gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers the war ended in the sugauli treaty under which nepal ceded recently captured portions of sikkim and lands in terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers madhesis having supported the east india company during the war had their lands gifted to nepali39 factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability in 1846 a plot was discovered

loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country jung bahadur kunwar emerged victorious and founded the rana dynasty later known as jung bahadur rana the king was made a titular figure and the post of prime minister was made powerful and hereditary the ranas were staunchly pro-british and assisted them during the indian rebellion of 1857 and

descent most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern nepal ever since44 in 1996 the communist party of nepal started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a peoples republic by violent means this led to the long nepali civil war and more than 12,000 deaths on 1 june 2001 there was a massacre in the royal palace king birendra queen aishwarya and seven other members of the royal family were killed the perpetrator was crown prince dipendra who committed suicide he died three days later shortly thereafter this outburst was alleged to have been dipendras

gyanendra inherited the throne on 1 february 2005 king gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent maoist movement43 but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities in september 2005 the maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate in response to the 2006 democracy movement king gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the

inclusive democratic republic4849 with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from 2830 may the king was thereafter given 15 days to vacate narayanhity palace so it could reopen as a

sugarcane root crops milk and water buffalo meat industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce including jute sugarcane tobacco and grain its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labor nepals economic growth continues to be adversely affected by the political uncertainty nevertheless real gdp growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 20112012 this is an improvement from the 3.5 percent gdp growth in 20102011 and would be the second-highest growth rate in the post-conflict era94 sources of growth include agriculture

percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 20064.1 percentage points per year which means that nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition child mortality electricity improved flooring and assets if the progress of reducing poverty continues at this rate then it is predicted that nepal will halve the current poverty rate and eradicate it within the next 20 years969798 the spectacular landscape and diverse exotic cultures of nepal represent considerable potential for tourism but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor infrastructure despite these problems in 2012 the number of international tourists visiting nepal was 598,204 a 10 increase on the previous year99 the tourism sector contributed nearly 3 of national gdp in 2012 and is the second-biggest foreign income earner after remittances100 the rate of unemployment and underemployment approaches half of the working-age population thus many nepali citizens move to other countries in search of work destinations include india qatar the united states thailand the united kingdom saudi arabia japan brunei darussalam australia and canada101102 nepal receives 50 million a

resources and poor infrastructure the ineffective post-1950 government and the long-running civil war are also factors in stunting the nations economic growth and development107108109 infrastructure energy main article energy in nepal middle marshyandi hydroelectricity dam nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower which it plans to export across south asia the bulk of the energy in nepal comes from fuel wood 68 agricultural waste 15 animal dung 8 and imported fossil fuels 8.110111 except for some lignite deposits nepal has no known oil gas or coal deposits all commercial fossil fuels mainly oil and coal are either imported from india or from international markets routed through india and china fuel imports absorb over one-fourth of nepals foreign exchange earnings111 only about 1 energy need is fulfilled by electricity the perennial nature of nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the countrys topography provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the worlds largest hydroelectric projects current estimates put nepals economically feasible hydropower potential to be approximately 83,000 mw from 66 hydropower project sites111112 however currently nepal has been able to exploit only about 600 mw from 20 medium to large hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants110 there are 9 major hydropower plants under construction and additional 27 sites considered for potential development110 only about 40 of nepals population has access to electricity110 there is a great disparity between urban and rural areas the electrification rate in urban areas is 90 whereas the rate for rural areas is only 5.111 power cuts of up to 22 hours a day take place in peak demand periods of winter and the peak electricity demand is almost the double the capability or dependable capacity113 the position of the power sector remains unsatisfactory because of high tariffs high system losses high generation costs high overheads over staffing and lower domestic demand111 transport main article transport in nepal nepal remains isolated from the worlds major land air and sea transport routes although within the country aviation is in a better state with 47 airports 11 of them with paved runways114 flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic the hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive in 2007 there were just over 10,142km 6,302mi of paved roads and 7,140km 4,437mi of unpaved road and one 59km 37mi railway line in the south114 there is a single reliable road route from india to the kathmandu valley more than one-third of its people live at least a two hours walk from the nearest all-season road 15 out of 75 district headquarters are not connected by road in addition around 60 of road network and most rural roads are not operable during the rainy season115 the only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for kathmandu is kolkata in west bengal state of india internally the poor state of development of the road system makes access to markets schools and health clinics a challenge107 telecommunications and mass media according to the nepal telecommunication authority mis may 2012 report116 there are seven operators and the total voice telephony subscribers including fixed and mobile are 16,350,946 which gives a penetration rate of 61.42 the fixed telephone service account for 9.37 mobile for 64.63 and other services lm gmpcs for 3.76 of the total penetration rate similarly the numbers of subscribers to datainternet services are 4,667,536 which represents 17.53 penetration rate most of the data service is accounted by gprs users twelve months earlier the datainternet penetration was 10.05 thus this represents a growth rate of 74.77.116 not only has there been strong subscriber growth especially in the mobile sector but there was evidence of a clear vision in the sector including putting a reform process in place and planning for the building of necessary telecommunications infrastructure most importantly the ministry of information and communications moic and the telecom regulator the national telecommunications authority nta have both been very active in the performance of their respective roles117 despite all the effort there remained a significant disparity between the high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions progress on providing some minimum access had been good of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country 306 were unserved by december 2009.117 in order to meet future demand it was estimated that nepal needed to invest around us135 million annually in its telecom sector117 in 2009 the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1 of the nations gdp118 as of 30 september 2012 nepal has 1,828,700 facebook users119 as of 2007update the state

in 2005123 in 2009 that enrollment rate was 90.124 however increasing access to secondary education grade 912 remains a major challenge as evidenced by the low net enrollment rate of 24 at this level more than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling in addition fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and among those who do fewer complete the 10th grade125 nepal has seven universities tribhuvan university kathmandu university pokhara university purbanchal university mahendra sanskrit university far-western university and

percent wasted and 36 percent underweight although there has been a declining trend for these rates over the past five years they remain alarmingly high133 in spite of these figures improvements in health care have been made most notably in maternal-child health in 2012 the under-five infant mortality was estimated to be 41 out of every 1000 children134135 overall nepals human development index hdi for health was 0.77 in 2011 ranking nepal 126 out of 194 countries up from 0.444 in 1980.136137 community forestry the community forestry program in nepal is a participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies institutions and practices the program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction as more than 70 percent of nepals population depends on agriculture for their livelihood community management of forests has been a critically important intervention through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades the program has evolved from a protection-oriented conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use enterprise development and livelihood improvement by april 2009 one-third of nepals population was participating in the program directly managing more than one-fourth of nepals forest area138139 the immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods community forestry shows traits of political financial and ecological sustainability including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework and robust civil society institutions and networks however a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning establishment of a strong civil society network flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process140141 science and technology main article science and technology in nepal erected by king bhupatindra malla in 1702 nyatapola is an important tourist attraction in the historical city of bhaktapur historical kingdoms that existed in the kathmandu valley are found to have made use of some clever technologies in numerous areas such as architecture agriculture civil engineering water management etc the gopals and abhirs who ruled the valley up until c 1000 bc used temporary materials for construction such as bamboo hay timber etc the kirat

including the april 2015 nepal earthquake142 nepal was a late entrant into the modern world of science and technology nepals first institution of higher education tri-chandra college was established by chandra shumsher in 1918 the college introduced science at the intermediate level a year later marking the genesis of formal science education in the country142 however the college was not accessible to the general public but only to a handful of members of the rana regime throughout the rana regime that lasted for well over a century nepal was effectively isolated from the rest of the world owing to this isolation nepal was relatively untouched by and unfamiliar of social transformations brought about by the british invasion in india and the industrial revolution in the west143 however after the advent of democracy and abolition of rana regime in 1951 nepal broke free from the shackles of self-imposed isolation and opened up to the outside world this opening marked the initiation of st activities in the country144 an underdeveloped country nepal is plagued with problems like poverty illiteracy unemployment etc consequently science and technology have invariably lagged behind in the priority list of the government on the other hand citing poor university education at home tens of thousands of nepali students leave the country every year with half of them never returning145146 these factors have been huge deterrents to the development of science and technology in nepal crime and law enforcement main article law enforcement in nepal see also directorate
