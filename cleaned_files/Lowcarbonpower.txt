portal renewable energy portal environment portal v t e low-carbon power comes from processes or technologies that produce power with substantially lower amounts of carbon dioxide emissions than is emitted from conventional fossil fuel power generation it includes low carbon power generation sources such as wind power solar power hydropower and including fuel preparation and decommissioning nuclear power12 the term largely excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating fossil fuel power systems specifically those that are

infrastructure 5.4 investment 6 see also 7 references historyedit over the past 30 yearswhen significant findings regarding global warming highlighted the need to curb carbon emissions from this the idea for low carbon power was born the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc established by the world meteorological organization wmo and the united nations environment program unep in 1988 set the scientific precedence for the introduction of low carbon power the ipcc has continued to provide scientific technical and socio-economic advice to the world community through its periodic assessment reports and special reports4 internationally the most prominent early step in the direction of low carbon power was the signing of the kyoto protocol which came into force on february 16 2005 under which most industrialized countries committed to reduce their carbon emissions the historical event set the political precedence for introduction of low carbon power technology on a social level perhaps the biggest factor contributing to the general publics awareness of climate change and the need for new technologies including low carbon power came from the documentary an inconvenient truth which clarified and highlighted the problem of global warming power sources by carbon dioxide emissionsedit main article life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources vattenfall studyedit the swedish utility vattenfall did a study of full life cycle emissions of nuclear hydro coal gas solar cell peat and wind which the utility uses to produce electricity the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power this compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal according to this study the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources5 sovacool life cycle study surveyedit sovacool says that the mean value of co2 emissions for nuclear power over the life cycle of a plant was 66.08 gkwh a 2008 meta analysis valuing the use gas emissions from nuclear power a critical survey6 by benjamin k sovacool analysed 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas-equivalent emissions for nuclear power plants the studies surveyed included the 1997 vattenfall comparative emissions study among others sovacools analysis calculated that the mean value of emissions over the lifetime of a nuclear power plant is 66 gkwh comparative results for wind power hydroelectricity solar thermal power and solar photovoltaic were 9-10 gkwh 10-13 gkwh 13 gkwh and 32 gkwh respectively7 sovacools analysis has been criticized for poor methodology and data selection8 yale university life cycle analysis of nuclear poweredit a 2012 life cycle assessment lca review by yale university said that depending on conditions median life cycle ghg emissions for nuclear electricity generation technologies could be 9 to 110 g co2-eqkwh by 2050 it stated9 the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle ghg emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies it added that for the most common category of reactors the light water reactor lwr harmonization decreased the median estimate for all lwr technology categories so that the medians of bwrs pwrs and all lwrs are similar at approximately 12 g co2-eqkwh differentiating attributes of low-carbon power sourcesedit there are many options for lowering current levels of carbon emissions some options such as wind power and solar power produce low quantities of total life cycle carbon emissions using entirely renewable sources other options such as nuclear power produce a comparable amount of carbon dioxide emissions as renewable technologies in total life cycle emissions but consume non-renewable but sustainable10 materials uranium the term low carbon power can also include power that continues to utilize the worlds natural resources such as natural gas and coal but only when they employ techniques that reduce carbon dioxide emissions from these sources when burning them for fuel such as the as of 2012 pilot plants performing carbon capture and storage311 as the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the united states the electric-power industry accounted for 39 of co2 emissions in 2004 a 27 increase since 1990.12 because the cost of reducing emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors such as transportation the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy13 technologies to produce electric power with low-carbon emissions are already in use at various scales together they account for roughly 28 of all us electric-power production with nuclear power representing the majority 20 followed by hydroelectric power 7.13 however demand for power is increasing driven by increased population and per capita demand and low carbon power can supplement the supply needed14 eroei energy sources in 2013 3.5 biomasscorn 3.9 solar pv germany 16 wind e-66 turbine 19 solar thermal cspdesert 28 fossil gas in a ccgt 30 coal 49 hydro medium-sized dam 75 nuclear in a pwr source15 according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on energy return on energy investederoei conducted by 6 analysts led by d weibach and described as the most extensive overview so far based on a careful evaluation of available life cycle assessments16 which was published in the peer reviewed journal energy in 2013 the uncorrected for their intermittencyunbuffered eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right151718 while the bufferedcorrected for their intermittency eroei stated in the paper for all low carbon power sources with the exception of nuclear and biomass were yet lower still as when corrected for their weather intermittencybuffered the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of eroei dependent on how reliant they are on back up energy sources1518 although the methodological integrity of this paper was challenged by marco raugei in late 2013.19 the authors of the initial paper responded to each of raugeis concerns in 2014 and after analysis each of raugeis concerns were summarized as not scientifically justified and based on faulty eroei understandings due to politically motivated energy evaluations20 examples of low carbon power technologyedit the 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change report identifies nuclear wind solar and hydroelectricity in suitable locations as technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5 of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power21 hydroelectric poweredit the hoover dam when completed in 1936 was both the worlds largest electric-power generating station and the worlds largest concrete structure hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years hydropower is also an extremely flexible technology from the perspective of power grid operation large hydropower provides one of the lowest cost options in todays energy market even compared to fossil fuels and there are no harmful emissions associated with plant operation22 however there are typically low greenhouse gas emissions with reservoirs and possibly high emissions in the tropics hydroelectric power is the worlds largest low carbon source of electricity supplying 16.6 of total electricity in 2014.23 china is by far the worlds largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world followed by brazil and canada however there are several significant social and environmental disadvantages of large-scale hydroelectric power systems dislocation if people are living where the reservoirs are planned release of significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane during construction and flooding of the reservoir and disruption of aquatic ecosystems and birdlife24 there is a strong consensus now that countries should adopt an integrated approach towards managing water resources which would involve planning hydropower development in co-operation with other water-using sectors22 nuclear poweredit blue cherenkov light being produced near the core of the fission powered advanced test reactor nuclear power with a 10.6 share of world electricity production as of 2013 is the second largest low-carbon power source25 nuclear power in 2010 also provided two thirds23 of the twenty seven nation european unions low-carbon energy26 with for example some eu nations sourcing a considerable amount of their electricity from nuclear power for example france derives 79 of its electricity from nuclear according to the iaea and european nuclear society worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries in 2013.2728 china has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction as of 2013 with plans to build many more2829 while in the us the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60years,30 and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration31 there are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in south korea india and russia this graph illustrates nuclear power is the united statess largest contributor of non-greenhouse-gas-emitting electric power generation comprising nearly three-quarters of the non-emitting sources nuclear powers capability to add significantly to future low carbon energy growth depends on several factors including the economics of new reactor designs such as generation iii reactors public opinion and national and regional politics the 104 us nuclear plants are undergoing a light water reactor sustainability program to sustainably extend the life span of the us nuclear fleet by a further 20 years with further us power plants under construction in 2013 such as the two ap1000s at vogtle electric generating plant however the economics of new nuclear power plants are still evolving and plans to add to those plants are mostly in flux32 wind poweredit see also list of onshore wind farms and list of offshore wind farms worldwide installed wind power capacity source gwec33 worldwide there are now over two hundred thousand wind turbines operating with a total nameplate capacity of 238,351mw as of end 2011,34 while not correcting for wind powers comparatively low 30 capacity factor the european union alone passed some 100,000 mw nameplate capacity in september 2012,35 while the united states surpassed 50,000 mw in august 2012 and china passed 50,000 mw the same month3637 world wind generation capacity more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 doubling about every three years the united states pioneered wind farms and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s in 1997 german installed capacity surpassed the us and led until once again overtaken by the us in 2008 china has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the us in 2010 to become the world leader at the end of 2011 worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generators was 238 gigawatts gw growing by 40.5 gw of nameplate capacity over the preceding year38 between 2005 and 2010 the average annual growth in new installations was 27.6 percent according to the world wind energy association an industry organization in 2010 wind power generated 430 twh or about 2.5 of worldwide electricity usage39 up from 1.5 in 2008 and 0.1 in 1997 wind powers share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1.40 several countries have already achieved relatively high levels of penetration such as 28 of stationary grid electricity production in denmark 2011,41 19 in portugal 2011,42 16 in spain 2011,43 14 in ireland 2010 to 201444 and 8 in germany 2011.45 as of 2011 83 countries around the world were using wind power on a commercial basis solar poweredit main article solar power the ps10 concentrates sunlight from a field of heliostats on a central tower solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics pv or indirectly using concentrated solar power csp concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the photoelectric effect46 commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s the 354 mw segs csp installation is the largest solar power plant in the world located in the mojave desert of california other large csp plants include the solnova solar power station 150 mw and the andasol solar power station 150 mw both in spain the over 200 mw agua caliente solar project in the united states and the 214 mw charanka solar park in india are the worlds largest photovoltaic plants solar powers share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1.40 geothermal poweredit main article geothermal electricity geothermal electricity is electricity generated from geothermal energy technologies in use include dry steam power plants flash steam power plants and binary cycle power plants geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries47 while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries48 current worldwide installed capacity is 10,715 megawatts mw with the largest capacity in the united states 3,086 mw49 philippines and indonesia estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000gw.48 geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the earths heat content50 the emission intensity of existing geothermal electric plants is on average 122kg of co 2 per megawatt-hour mwh of electricity a small fraction of that of conventional fossil fuel plants51 tidal poweredit tidal power is a form of hydropower that converts the energy of tides into electricity or other useful forms of power the first large-scale tidal power plant the rance tidal power station started operation in 1966 although not yet widely used tidal power has potential for future electricity generation tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power carbon capture and storageedit see also life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources carbon capture and storage captures carbon dioxide from the flue gas of power plants or other industry transporting it to an appropriate location where it can be buried securely in an underground reservoir while the technologies involved are all in use and carbon capture and storage is occurring in other industries eg at the sleipner gas field no large scale integrated project has yet become operational within the power industry improvements to current carbon capture and storage technologies could reduce co2 capture costs by at least 20-30 over approximately the next decade while new technologies under development promise more substantial cost reduction52 the outlook for and requirements of low carbon poweredit emissionsedit greenhouse gas emissions by sector see world resources institute for detailed breakdown the intergovernmental panel on climate change stated in its first working group report that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations contribute to climate change53 as a percentage of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions carbon dioxide co2 accounts for 72 percent54 and has increased in concentration in the atmosphere from 315 parts per million ppm in 1958 to more than 375 ppm in 2005.55 emissions from energy make up more than 61.4 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions56 power generation from traditional coal fuel sources accounts for 18.8 percent of all world greenhouse gas emissions nearly double that emitted by road transportation56 estimates state that by 2020 the world will be producing around twice as much carbon emissions as it was in 2000.57 electricity usageedit world co2 emissions by region world energy consumption is predicted to increase from 421 quadrillion british thermal units btu in 2003 to 722 quadrillion btu in 2030.58 coal consumption is predicted to nearly double in that same time59 the fastest growth is seen in non-oecd asian countries especially china and india where economic growth drives increased energy use60 by implementing low carbon power options world electricity demand could continue to grow while maintaining stable carbon emission levels in the transportation sector there are moves away from fossil fuels and towards electric vehicles such as mass transit and the electric car these trends are small but may eventually add a large demand to the electrical grid domestic and industrial heat and hot water have largely been supplied by burning fossil fuels such as fuel oil or natural gas at the consumers premises some countries have begun heat pump rebates to encourage switching to electricity potentially adding a large demand to the grid61 energy infrastructureedit 23 of world coal capacity is yet to be built by 2015 one-third of the 2007 us coal plants will be more than 50 years old62 nearly two-thirds of the generation capacity required to meet power demand in 2030 is yet to be built62 there were 151 new coal-fired power plants planned for the us providing 90gw of power52 by 2012 that had dropped to 15 mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of co2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced63 investmentedit investment in low carbon power sources and technologies is increasing at a rapid rate zero-carbon power sources produce about 2 of the worlds energy but account for about 18 of world investment in power generation attracting 100 billion of investment capital in 2006.64 see alsoedit carbon capture and
