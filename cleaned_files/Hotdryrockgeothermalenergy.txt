hot dry rock hdr is by far the most abundant source of geothermal energy available to mankind a vast store of thermal energy is contained in the hotbut essentially dryimpervious crystalline basement rocks found almost everywhere deep beneath the earths surface1 a concept for the extraction of useful amounts of geothermal energy from hdr originated at the los alamos national laboratory in 1970 and was so groundbreaking that laboratory researchers were awarded a us patent covering it2 part of a series on renewable energy biofuel biomass geothermal hydropower solar energy tidal power wave power

different3 whereas hydrothermal energy production can only exploit hot fluids already in place in the earths crust an hdr system consisting of the pressurized hdr reservoir the boreholes drilled from the surface and the surface injection pumps and associated plumbing recovers the earths heat from hot but dry regions via the closed-loop circulation of pressurized fluid this fluid injected from the surface under high pressure opens pre-existing joints in the basement rock thus creating a man-made reservoir that may be as much as a cubic kilometer in size the fluid injected into the reservoir absorbs thermal energy from the high-temperature rock surfaces and then serves as the vehicle for transporting that heat to the surface for practical use planning and controledit as the reservoir is formed by the pressure-dilation of the joints the elastic response of the surrounding rock mass results in a region of tightly compressed sealed rock at the peripherymaking the hdr reservoir totally confined and contained such a reservoir is therefore fully engineered in that the physical characteristics size depth at which it is created as well as the operating parameters injection and production pressures production temperature etc can be pre-planned and closely controlled drilling and pressurizationedit as described by brown4 an hdr geothermal energy system is developed first by using conventional drilling to access a region of deep hot basement rock once it has been determined that the selected region contains no open faults or joints by far the most common situation an isolated section of this first borehole is pressurized at a level high enough to open several sets of previously sealed joints in the rock mass by continuous pumping hydraulic stimulation a very large region of stimulated rock is created the hdr reservoir that consists of an interconnected array of joint flow paths within the rock mass the opening of these flow paths causes movement along the pressure-activated joints generating seismic signals microearthquakes analysis of these signals yields information about the location and dimensions of the reservoir being developed production wellsedit typically an hdr reservoir forms in the shape of an ellipsoid with its longest axis orthogonal to the least principal earth stress this pressure-stimulated region is then accessed by two production wells drilled to intersect the hdr reservoir near the elongated ends of the stimulated region in most cases the initial borehole becomes the injection well for the three-well pressurized water-circulating system operationedit in operation fluid is injected at pressures high enough to hold open the interconnected network of joints against the earth stresses and to effectively circulate fluid through the hdr reservoir at a high rate during routine energy production the injection pressure is maintained at just below the level that would cause further pressure-stimulation of the surrounding rock mass in order to maximize energy production while limiting further reservoir growth productivityedit the volume of the newly created array of opened joints within the hdr reservoir is much less than 1 of the volume of the pressure-stimulated rock mass as these joints continue to pressure-dilate the overall flow impedance across the reservoir becomes very low leading to a high thermal productivity feasibility studiesedit the feasibility of mining heat from the deep earth was proven in two separate hdr reservoir flow demonstrationseach involving about one year of circulationconducted by the los alamos national laboratory between 1978 and 1995 these groundbreaking tests took place at the laboratorys fenton hill hdr test site in the jemez mountains of north-central new mexico at depths of over 8000ft and rock temperatures in excess of 180c.5 the results of these tests demonstrated conclusively the viability of the revolutionary new hdr geothermal energy concept the two separate reservoirs created at fenton hill are still the only truly confined hdr geothermal energy reservoirs flow-tested anywhere in the world unconfirmed systemsedit there have been numerous reports of the testing of unconfined geothermal systems pressure-stimulated in crystalline basement rock for instance at the rosemanowes quarry in cornwall england6 at the hijiori7 and ogachi8 calderas in japan at the faulted soultz-sous-forts hdr system in france9 and in the cooper basin australia10 however all these engineered geothermal systems while developed under programs directed toward the investigation of hdr technologies have proven to be openas evidenced by the high water losses observed during pressurized circulation11 in essence they are all egs or hydrothermal systems not true hdr reservoirs enhanced geothermal systemsedit main article enhanced geothermal system the egs concept was first described by los alamos researchers in 1990 at a geothermal symposium sponsored by the united states department of energy doe12many years before the doe coined the term egs in an attempt to emphasize the geothermal aspect of heat mining rather than the unique characteristics of hdr fenton hill testsedit phase iedit the first hdr reservoir tested at fenton hill the phase i reservoir was created in june 1977 and then flow-tested for 75 days from january to april 1978 at a thermal power level of 4 mw13 the final water loss rate at a surface injection pressure of 900 psi was 2 gpm 2 of the injection rate this initial reservoir was shown to essentially consist ofa single pressure-dilated near-vertical joint with a vanishingly small flow impedance of 0.5 psigpm the initial phase i reservoir was enlarged in 1979 and further flow-tested for almost a year in 1980.14 of greatest importance this flow test confirmed that the enlarged reservoir was also confined and exhibited a low water loss rate of 6 gpm this reservoir consisted of the single near-vertical joint of the initial reservoir which as noted above had been flow-tested for 75 days in early 1978augmented by a set of newly pressure-stimulated near-vertical joints that were somewhat oblique to the strike of the original joint phase iiedit a deeper and hotter hdr reservoir phase ii was created during a massive hydraulic fracturing mhf operation in late 1983.14 it was first flow-tested in the spring of 1985 by an initial closed-loop flow test icft that lasted a little over a month15 information garnered from the icft provided the basis for a subsequent long-term flow test ltft carried out from 1992 to 1995 the ltft comprised several individual steady-state flow runs interspersed with numerous additional experiments16 in 19921993 two steady-state circulation periods were implemented the first for 112 days and the second for 55 days during both tests water was routinely produced at a temperature of over 180c and a rate of 90100 gpm resulting in continuous thermal energy production of approximately 4 mw over this time span the reservoir pressure was maintained even during shut-in periods at a level of about 15 mpa beginning in mid-1993 the reservoir was shut in for a period of nearly two years and the applied pressure was allowed to drop to essentially zero in the spring of 1995 the system was re-pressurized and a third continuous circulation run of 66 days was conducted17 remarkably the production parameters observed in the two earlier tests were rapidly re-established and steady-state energy production resumed at the same level as before observations during both the shut-in and operational phases of all these flow-testing periods provided clear evidence that the rock at the boundary of this man-made reservoir had been compressed by the pressurization and resultant expansion of the reservoir region as a result of the ltft water loss was eliminated as a major concern in hdr operations18 over the period of the ltft water consumption fell to just 7 of the quantity of water injected and data indicated it would have continued to decline under steady-state circulation conditions dissolved solids and gases in the produced fluid rapidly reached equilibrium values at low concentrations about one-tenth the salinity of sea water and the fluid remained geochemically benign throughout the test period19 routine operation of the automated surface plant showed that hdr energy systems could be run using the same economical staffing schedules that a number of unmanned commercial hydrothermal plants already employ test resultsedit the fenton hill tests clearly demonstrated the advantages of a fully engineered hdr reservoir over naturally occurring hydrothermal resources including egs with all the essential physical characteristics of the reservoirincluding rock volume fluid capacity temperature etcestablished during the engineered creation of the reservoir zone and the entire reservoir volume enclosed by a hyperstressed periphery of sealed rock any variations in operating conditions are totally determined by intentional changes made at the surface in contrast a natural hydrothermal reservoirwhich is essentially open and therefore unconfinedhaving boundaries that are highly variableis inherently subject to changes in natural conditions another advantage of an hdr reservoir is that its confined nature makes it highly suitable for load-following operations whereby the rate of energy production is varied to meet the varying demand for electric powera process that can greatly increase the economic competitiveness of the technology20 this concept was evaluated near the end of the phase ii testing period when energy production was increased by 60 for 4 hours each day by a programmed vent-down of the high-pressure reservoir regions surrounding the production borehole within two days it became possible to computerize the process such that production was automatically increased and decreased according to the desired schedule for the rest of the test period the transitions between the two production levels took less than 5 minutes and at each level steady-state production was consistently maintained such load-following operations could not be implemented in a natural hydrothermal system or even in an egs system because of the unconfined volume and boundary conditions the experiments at fenton hill have clearly demonstrated that hdr technology is unique not only with respect to how the pressurized reservoir is created and then circulated but also because of the management flexibility it offers it has in common with hydrothermal technology only that both are geothermal hwr versus hdredit hot wet rock hwr hydrothermal technology makes use of hot fluids found naturally in basement rock but such hwr conditions are rare21 by far the bulk of the worlds geothermal resource base over 98 is in the form of basement rock that is hot but drywith no naturally available water this means that hdr technology is applicable almost everywhere on earth hence the claim that hdr geothermal energy is ubiquitous typically the temperature in those vast regions of the accessible crystalline basement rock increases with depth this geothermal gradient which is the principal hdr resource variable ranges from less than 20ckm to over 60ckm depending upon location the concomitant hdr economic variable is the cost of drilling to depths at which rock temperatures are sufficiently high to permit the development of a suitable reservoir22 with the advent of pdc polycrystalline diamond compact insert bits for hard rock drilling eg novatek of provo utah the cost of deep basement drilling is set to come down drasticallyawaiting only a significant demand such as the commercial development of hdr possible confusionedit as noted above in the late 1990s the doe began referring to all attempts to extract geothermal energy from basement rock as egs which has led to both biographical and technical confusion biographically a large number of publications exist that discuss work to extract energy from hdr without any mention of the term egs thus an internet search using the term egs would not identify these publications but the technical distinction between hdr and egs as clarified in this article may be even more important some sources describe the permeability of the earths basement rock as a continuum ranging from totally impermeable hdr to slightly permeable hwr to highly permeable conventional hydrothermal23 however this continuum concept is not technically correct a more appropriate view would be to consider impermeable hdr rock as a separate state from that of the continuum of permeable rockjust as one would consider a completely closed faucet as distinct from one that is open to any degree whether the flow be a trickle or a flood in the same way hdr technology should be regarded as totally distinct from egs further readingedit a
