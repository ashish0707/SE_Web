building construction late 1854 bunsen suggested design principles universitys mechanic peter desaga asked construct prototype similar principles earlier burner design michael faraday device patented 1856 gas engineer elsner bunsendesaga design succeeded generating hot sootless non-luminous flame mixing gas air controlled fashion combustion desaga created adjustable slits air bottom cylindrical
