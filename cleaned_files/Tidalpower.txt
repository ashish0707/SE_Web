portal renewable energy portal environment portal v t e tidal power also called tidal energy is a form of hydropower that converts the energy obtained from tides into useful forms of power mainly electricity although not yet widely used tidal power has potential for future electricity generation tides are more predictable than wind energy and solar power among sources of renewable energy tidal power has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities thus constricting its total availability however many recentwhen clarification needed technological developments and improvements both in design eg dynamic tidal power tidal lagoons and turbine technology eg new axial turbines cross flow turbines indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels historically tide mills have been used both in europe and on the atlantic coast of north america the incoming water was contained in large storage ponds and as the tide went out it turned waterwheels that used the mechanical power it produced to mill grain1 the earliest occurrences date from the middle ages or even from roman times23 it was only in the 19th century that the process of using falling water and spinning turbines to create electricity was introduced in the us and europe4 the worlds first large-scale tidal power plant is the rance tidal power station in france which became operational in 1966 it was the largest tidal power station in terms of power output before sihwa lake tidal power station surpassed it total harvestable energy from tidal areas close to the coast is estimated to be around 1 terawatt worldwide5 contents 1 generation of tidal energy 2 generating methods 2.1 tidal stream generator 2.2 tidal barrage 2.3 dynamic tidal power 2.4 tidal lagoon 3 us and canadian studies

and tidal acceleration tidal power is taken from the earths oceanic tides tidal forces are periodic variations in gravitational attraction exerted by celestial bodies these forces create corresponding motions or currents in the worlds oceans due to the strong attraction to the oceans a bulge in the water level is created causing a temporary increase in sea level when the sea level is raised water from the middle of the ocean is forced to move toward the shorelines creating a tide this occurrence takes place in an unfailing manner due to the consistent pattern of the moons orbit around the earth6 the magnitude and character of this motion reflects the changing positions of the moon and sun relative to the earth the effects of earths rotation and local geography of the sea floor and coastlines tidal power is the only technology that draws on energy inherent in the orbital characteristics of the earthmoon system and to a lesser extent in the earthsun system other natural energies exploited by human technology originate directly or indirectly with the sun including fossil fuel conventional hydroelectric wind biofuel wave and solar energy nuclear energy makes use of earths mineral deposits of fissionable elements while geothermal power taps the earths internal heat which comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion about 20 and heat produced through radioactive decay 80.7 a tidal generator converts the energy of tidal flows into electricity greater tidal variation and higher tidal current velocities can dramatically increase the potential of a site for tidal electricity generation because the earths tides are ultimately due to gravitational interaction with the moon and sun and the earths rotation tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable energy resource movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the earthmoon system this is a result of pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence this loss of energy has caused the rotation of the earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation during the last 620million years the period of rotation of the earth length of a day has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours8 in this period the earth has lost 17 of its rotational energy while tidal power will take additional energy from the system the effectclarification needed is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years9 generating methodsedit the worlds first commercial-scale and grid-connected tidal stream generator seagen in strangford lough10 the strong wake shows the power in the tidal current tidal power can be classified into four generating methods tidal stream generatoredit main article tidal stream generator tidal stream generators or tsgs make use of the kinetic energy of moving water to power turbines in a similar way to wind turbines that use wind to power turbines some tidal generators can be built into the structures of existing bridges or are entirely submersed thus avoiding concerns over impact on the natural landscape land constrictions such as straits or inlets can create high velocities at specific sites which can be captured with the use of turbines these turbines can be horizontal vertical open or ducted and are typically placed near the bottom of the water column where tidal velocities are greatest11 tidal barrageedit main article tidal barrage tidal barrages make use of the potential energy in the difference in height or hydraulic head between high and low tides when using tidal barrages to generate power the potential energy from a tide is seized through strategic placement of specialized dams when the sea level rises and the tide begins to come in the temporary increase in tidal power is channeled into a large basin behind the dam holding a large amount of potential energy with the receding tide this energy is then converted into mechanical energy as the water is released through large turbines that create electrical power through the use of generators12 barrages are essentially dams across the full width of a tidal estuary dynamic tidal poweredit main article dynamic tidal power top-down view of a dtp dam blue and dark red colors indicate low and high tides respectively dynamic tidal power or dtp is an untried but promising technology that would exploit an interaction between potential and kinetic energies in tidal flows it proposes that very long dams for example 3050km length be built from coasts straight out into the sea or ocean without enclosing an area tidal phase differences are introduced across the dam leading to a significant water-level differential in shallow coastal seas featuring strong coast-parallel oscillating tidal currents such as found in the uk china and korea tidal lagoonedit a newer tidal energy design option is to construct circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides the created reservoirs are similar to those of tidal barrages except that the location is artificial and does not contain a preexisting ecosystem11 the lagoons can also be in double or triple format without pumping13 or with pumping14 that will flatten out the power output the pumping power could be provided by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage the proposed tidal lagoon swansea bay in wales united kingdom would be the first tidal power station of this type once built15 us and canadian studies in the twentieth centuryedit the first study of large scale tidal power plants was by the us federal power commission in 1924 which if built would have been located in the northern border area of the us state of maine and the south eastern border area of the canadian province of new brunswick with various dams powerhouses and ship locks enclosing the bay of fundy and passamaquoddy bay note see map in reference nothing came of the study and it is unknown whether canada had been approached about the study by the us federal power commission16 in 1956 utility nova scotia light and power of halifax commissioned a pair of studies into the feasibility of commercial tidal power development on the nova scotia side of the bay of fundy the two studies by stone webster of boston and by montreal engineering company of montreal independently concluded that millions of horsepower could be harnessed from fundy but that development costs would be commercially prohibitive at that time17 there was also a report on the international commission in april 1961 entitled investigation of the international passamaquoddy tidal power project produced by both the us and canadian federal governments according to benefit to costs ratios the project was beneficial to the us but not to canada a highway system along the top of the dams was envisioned as well a study was commissioned by the canadian nova scotian and new brunswick governments reassessment of fundy tidal power to determine the potential for tidal barrages at chignecto bay and minas basin at the end of the fundy bay estuary there were three sites determined to be financially feasible shepody bay 1550 mw cumberline basin 1085 mw and cobequid bay 3800 mw these were never built despite their apparent feasibility in 1977.18 tidal power development in the ukedit the worlds first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the uk based in orkney scotland the european marine energy centre emec has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world emec provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions its grid connected tidal test site is located at the fall of warness off the island of eday in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the atlantic ocean and north sea this area has a very strong tidal current which can travel up to 4ms 8 knots in spring tides tidal energy developers currently testing at the site include alstom formerly tidal generation ltd andritz hydro hammerfest openhydro scotrenewables tidal power voith19 the resource could be 4 tj per year20 current and future tidal power schemesedit main article list of tidal power stations the first tidal power station was the rance tidal power plant built over a period of 6years from 1960 to 1966 at la rance france21 it has 240mw installed capacity 254 mw sihwa lake tidal power plant in south korea is the largest tidal power installation in the world construction was completed in 2011.2223 the first tidal power site in north america is the annapolis royal generating station annapolis royal nova scotia which opened in 1984 on an inlet of the bay of fundy24 it has 20mw installed capacity the jiangxia tidal power station south of hangzhou in china has been operational since 1985 with current installed capacity of 3.2 mw more tidal power is planned near the mouth of the yalu river25 the first in-stream tidal current generator in north america race rocks tidal power demonstration project was installed at race rocks on southern vancouver island in september 2006.2627 the next phase in the development of this tidal current generator will be in nova scotia bay of fundy28 a small project was built by the soviet union at kislaya guba on the barents sea it has 0.4mw installed capacity in 2006 it was upgraded with a 1.2mw experimental advanced orthogonal turbine jindo uldolmok tidal power plant in south korea is a tidal stream generation scheme planned to be expanded progressively to 90 mw of capacity by 2013 the first 1 mw was installed in may 2009.29 a 1.2 mw seagen system became operational in late 2008 on strangford lough in northern ireland30 the contract for an 812 mw tidal barrage near ganghwa island south korea north-west of incheon has been signed by daewoo completion is planned for 2015.22 a 1,320 mw barrage built around islands west of incheon is proposed by the south korean government with projected construction starting in 2017.31 the scottish government has approved plans for a 10mw array of tidal stream generators near islay scotland costing 40 million pounds and consisting of 10 turbines enough to power over 5,000 homes the first turbine is expected to be in operation by 2013.32 the indian state of gujarat is planning to host south asias first commercial-scale tidal power station the company atlantis resources planned to install a 50mw tidal farm in the gulf of kutch on indias west coast with construction starting early in 2012.33 ocean renewable power corporation was the first company to deliver tidal power to the us grid in september 2012 when its pilot tidgen system was successfully deployed in cobscook bay near eastport34 in new york city 30 tidal turbines will be installed by verdant power in the east river by 2015 with a capacity of 1.05mw.35 construction of a 320 mw tidal lagoon power plant outside the city of swansea in the uk was granted planning permission in june 2015 and work is expected to start in 2016 once completed it will generate over 500gwh of electricity per year enough to power roughly 155,000 homes36 a turbine project is being installed in ramsey sound in 2014.3738 tidal power issuesedit environmental concernsedit tidal power can have effects on marine life the turbines can accidentally kill swimming sea life with the rotating blades although projects such as the one in strangford feature a safety mechanism that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach39 some fish may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power energy generators in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many marine animals as possible will not be affected by it the tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy40 tidal turbinesedit the main environmental concern with tidal energy is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices as with all offshore renewable energies there is also a concern about how the creation of emf and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms it should be noted that because these devices are in the water the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment such as dolphins and whales tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes41 depending on the size of the project these effects can range from small traces of sediment building up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes42 tidal barrageedit installing a barrage may change the shoreline within the bay or estuary affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats inhibiting the flow of water in and out of the bay there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary causing additional turbidity suspended solids and less saltwater which may result in the death of fish that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams and may attempt to pass through the turbines the same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue though locks can be added to allow slow passage however the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary42 in august 2004 a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the annapolis royal generating station at slack tide ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the annapolis basin43 tidal lagoonedit environmentally the main concerns are blade strike on fish attempting to enter the lagoon acoustic output from turbines and changes in sedimentation processes however all these effects are localized and do not affect the entire estuary or bay42 corrosionedit salt water causes corrosion in metal parts it can be difficult to maintain tidal stream generators due to their size and depth in the water the use of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steels high-nickel alloys copper-nickel alloys nickel-copper alloys and titanium can greatly reduce or eliminate corrosion damage mechanical fluids such as lubricants can leak out which may be harmful to the marine life nearby proper maintenance can minimize the amount of harmful chemicals that may enter the environment foulingedit the biological events that happen when placing any structure in an area of high tidal currents and high biological productivity in the ocean will ensure that the structure becomes an ideal substrate for the growth of marine organisms in the references of the tidal current project at race rocks in british columbia this is documented also see this page and several structural materials and coatings were tested by the lester pearson college divers to assist clean current in reducing fouling on the turbine and other underwater infrastructure structural health monitoringedit the high load factors resulting from the fact that water is 800 times denser than air and the predictable and reliable nature of tides compared with the wind makes tidal energy particularly attractive for electric power generation condition monitoring is the key for exploiting it cost-efficiently44 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal sustainable development portal thermal energy world energy resources and consumption structural health monitoring
