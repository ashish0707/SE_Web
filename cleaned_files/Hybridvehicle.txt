petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines using a variety of fuels generally gasoline or diesel engines and electric motors to power the vehicle the energy is stored in the fuel of the internal combustion engine and an electric battery set there are many types of petroleum-electric hybrid drivetrains from full hybrid to mild hybrid which offer varying advantages and disadvantages28 henri pieper in 1899 developed the worlds first petro-electric hybrid automobile in 1900 ferdinand porsche developed a series-hybrid using two motor-in-wheel-hub arrangements with an

until the battery is discharged some of battery-electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the london underground are capable of this mode of operation power is picked up from the electtrified rails where possible switching to battery power where the electricity supply is disconnected this provides the advantage in principle of virtually unrestricted highway range as long as you stay where you have bev infrastructure access since many destinations are within 100km of a major highway this may reduce the need for expensive battery systems unfortunately private use of the

energy sources or input types fuels using the same engine to be hybrids although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms these are perhaps more correctly described as dual mode vehicles some electric trolleybuses can switch between an on-board diesel engine and overhead electrical power depending on conditions see dual mode bus in principle this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid trolleybus although as of 2006update no such design seems to have been announced flexible-fuel vehicles can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank typically gasoline and ethanol or methanol or biobutanol bi-fuel vehicle liquified petroleum gas and natural gas are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks so it would be impossible to build an lpg or ng flexible fuel system instead vehicles are built with two parallel fuel systems feeding one engine for example chevys silverado 2500 hd which is now on the road can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas and offers a range of over 650 miles 1,000km.30 while the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications the increased range decreased cost of fuel and flexibility where lpg or ng infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase while the us natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete it is increasing at a fast pace and already has 2600 cng stations in place31 with a growing fueling station infrastructure a large scale adoption of these bi-fuel vehicles could be seen in the near future rising gas prices may also push consumers to purchase these vehicles when gas prices trade around 4.00 the price per mmbtu of gasoline is 28.00 compared to natural gass 4.00 per mmbtu32 on a per unit of energy comparative basis this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline all of these factors are making cng-gasoline bi-fuel vehicles very attractive some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available such as cars modified to run on autogas lpg and diesels modified to run on waste vegetable oil that has not been processed into biodiesel

and very large construction vehicles high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars in the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic

american sedan car the test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined epa cityhighway driving cycles acceleration was 0-60mph in 8 seconds using a 1.9 liter diesel engine no lightweight materials were used the epa estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only 700 to the base cost of the vehicle21 the petro-hydraulic hybrid system has faster and more efficient chargedischarge cycling than petro-electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build the accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine in hp and physical size research is underway in large corporations and small companies focus has now switched to smaller vehicles the system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars a drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load a british company artemis intelligent power made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motorpump the digital displacement motorpump the pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids38 the company converted a bmw car as a test bed to prove viability the bmw 530i gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car this test was using the standard 3,000cc engine with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive the design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage not peak power usage peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator a smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator39 current vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing enginetransmission setups it is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups one research projects goal is to create a blank paper design new car to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle all bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car one design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car the small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy the hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes mechanical transmissions drive shafts and u joints reducing costs and weight hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles40 the aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator a small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator the accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged the

electric drive train there are two motors an electric motor and an internal combustion engine the power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power splitter which is a simple planetary gear set the ratio can be from 100 for the combustion engine to 100 for the electric motor or anything in between such as 40 for the electric motor and 60 for the combustion engine the combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries modern versions such as the toyota hybrid synergy drive have a second electric motorgenerator on the output shaft connected to the wheels in cooperation with the primary motorgenerator and the mechanical power-split this provides a continuously variable transmission on the open road the primary power source is the internal combustion engine when maximum power is required for example to overtake the electric motor is used to assist this increases the available power for a short period giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed in most applications the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary reducing curbside emissions passenger car installations include toyota

series- or serial-hybrid vehicle is driven by an electric motor functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient there is no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels and the purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery unless there has been a rework of the drivetrain since its first release there is a mechanical linkage in the chevrolet volt52 series-hybrids have also been referred to as extended range electric vehicle range-extended electric vehicle or electric vehicle-extended range erevreevever the bmw i3 with range extender is a production series-hybrid it operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low and then activates the generator to maintain power and is also available without the range extender the fisker karma was the first series hybrid production vehicle when describing cars the battery of a series hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in - but technically a series-hybrid allows for a battery to only act as a buffer and for regeneration purposes and for the electric motors power to be supplied constantly by the supporting engine series arrangements have been common in diesel-electric locomotives and ships ferdinand porsche effectively invented this arrangement in racing cars in the early 20th century such as the lohner-porsche mixte hybrid with porsche naming the arrangement system mixt - a wheel hub motor arrangement with a motor in each of the two front wheels was used setting speed records this arrangement was sometimes referred to as an electric transmission as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission the vehicle could not move unless

hybrid vehicles is the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle phev the plug-in hybrid is usually a general fuel-electric parallel or serial hybrid with increased energy storage capacity usually through a lithium-ion battery which allows the vehicle to drive on all-electric mode a distance that depends on the battery size and its mechanical layout series or parallel it may be connected to mains electricity supply at the end of the journey to avoid charging using the on-board internal combustion engine5657 this concept is attractive to those seeking to minimize on-road emissions by avoiding or at least minimizing the use of ice during daily driving as with pure electric vehicles the total emissions saving for example in co2 terms is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company for some users this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petroldiesel that they would have otherwise used current tax systems in many european countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source this is generally not the case for electricity which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer however that person uses it some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off-peak night users which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug-in option for commuters and urban motorists road safety for cyclists pedestriansedit the 2011 nissan leaf was the first plug-in electric car equipped with nissans vehicle sound for pedestrians main article electric vehicle warning sounds a 2009 national highway traffic safety administration report examined hybrid electric vehicle accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving internal combustion engine vehicles icev the findings showed that in certain road situations hevs are more dangerous for those on foot or bicycle for accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping backing up entering or leaving a parking space when the sound difference between hevs and icevs is most pronounced hevs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than icevs for crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians there was a higher incident rate for hevs than icevs when a vehicle was turning a corner but there was no statistically significant difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight58 several automakers developed electric vehicle warning sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicle plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles evs travelling at low speeds their purpose is to make pedestrians cyclists the blind and others aware of the vehicles presence while

v and the toyota prius plug-in hybrid environmental issuesedit fuel consumption and emissions reductionsedit the hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles icevs resulting in fewer emissions being generated these savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage a smaller engine can have less internal losses and lower weight having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy especially in stop-and-go traffic typical of the city driving cycle recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat this regenerative braking reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity depending upon the power rating of the motorgenerator other techniques that are not necessarily hybrid features but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include using atkinson cycle engines instead of otto cycle engines for improved fuel economy shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods improving aerodynamics part of the reason that suvs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car a box shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve vehicle handling at the same time using low rolling resistance tires tires were often made to give a quiet smooth ride high grip etc but efficiency was a lower priority tires cause mechanical drag once again making the engine work harder consuming more fuel hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of carcass structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source powering the ac power steering and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts these features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops coasting and idling periods in addition noise emissions are reduced particularly at idling and low operating speeds in comparison to conventional engine vehicles for continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions hybrid vehicle emissionsedit hybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the epa environmental protection agency the recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide the three most popular hybrid vehicles honda civic honda insight and toyota prius set the standards even higher by producing 4.1 3.5 and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog-forming pollutants by up to 90 and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half63 more fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this64 environmental impact of hybrid car batteryedit main article electric

today most hybrid car batteries are one of two types 1 nickel metal hydride or 2 lithium ion both are regarded as more environmentally friendly than lead-based batteries which constitute the bulk of petrol car starter batteries today there are many types of batteries some are far more toxic than others lithium ion is the least toxic of the two mentioned above65 the toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteriesthe type currently used in hybridsare much lower than batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium according to one source66 another source claims nickel metal hydride batteries are much more toxic than lead batteries also that recycling them and disposing of them safely is difficult67 in general various soluble and insoluble nickel compounds such as nickel chloride and nickel oxide have known carcinogenic effects in chick embryos and rats686970 the main nickel compound in nimh batteries is nickel oxyhydroxide niooh which is used as the positive electrode the lithium-ion battery has attracted attention due to its potential for use in hybrid electric vehicles hitachi is a leader in its development in addition to its smaller size and lighter weight lithium-ion batteries deliver performance that helps to protect the environment with features such as improved charge efficiency without memory effect the lithium-ion batteries are appealing because they have the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage more than three times that of nickelmetal hydride battery cell while simultaneously storing large quantities of electricity as well the batteries also produce higher output boosting vehicle power higher efficiency avoiding wasteful use of electricity and provides excellent durability compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle additionally use of lithium-ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of 30 better than petro-powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in co2 emissions helping to prevent global warming 71 chargingedit the optimum charging window for lithium ion batteries is 3-4.2 v recharging with a 120 volt household outlet takes several hours a 240 volt charger takes 14 hours and a quick charge takes approximately 30 minutes to achieve 80 charge 3

electricity the electricity then gets discharged most effectively when the car accelerates or climbs up an incline in 2014 hybrid electric car batteries can run on solely electricity for 70130 miles 110210 km on a single charge hybrid battery capacity currently ranges from 4.4 kwh to 85 kwh on a fully electric car on a hybrid car the battery packs currently range from 0.6 kwh to 2.4 kwh representing a large difference in use of electricity in hybrid cars73 raw materials increasing costsedit this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information february 2014 there is an impending increase in the costs of many rare materials used in the manufacture of hybrid cars74 for example the rare earth element dysprosium is required to fabricate many of the advanced electric motors and battery systems in hybrid propulsion systems7475 neodymium is another rare earth metal which is a crucial ingredient in high-strength magnets that are found in permanent magnet electric motors76 nearly all the rare earth elements in the world come from china77 and many analysts believe that an overall increase in chinese electronics manufacturing will consume this entire supply by 2012.74 in addition export quotas on chinese rare earth elements have resulted in an unknown amount of supply7578 a few non-chinese sources such as the advanced hoidas lake project in northern canada as well as mount weld in australia are currently under development78 however the barriers to entry are high79 and require years to go online how hybrid-electric vehicles workedit hybrids-electric vehicles hevs combine the advantage of gasoline engines and electric motors the key areas for efficiency or performance gains are regenerative braking dual power sources and less idling80 regenerate braking the drivetrain can be used to convert kinetic energy from the moving car into stored electrical energy batteries the same electric motor that powers the drivetrain is used to resist the motion of the drivetrain this applied resistance from the electric motor causes the wheel to slow down and simultaneously recharge the batteries dual power power can come from either the engine motor or both depending on driving circumstances additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor or more commonly a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low-speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds automatic startshutoff it automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down this automation is much simpler with an electric motor also see dual power above alternative green vehiclesedit main article green vehicle types other types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than fossil fuel another option is to use alternative fuel composition ie biofuels in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles making them go partly on renewable energy sources other approaches include personal rapid transit a public transportation concept that offers automated on-demand non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways peugeotcitron hybrid vehicleedit peugeot and citron have announced that they too are building a car that uses compressed air as an energy source however the car they are designing uses a hybrid system which also uses a gasoline engine which is used for propelling the car over 70kmh or when the compressed air tank has been depleted81 marketingedit automakers spend around us8 million in marketing hybrid vehicles each year with combined effort from many car companies the hybrid industry has sold millions of hybridscitation needed hybrid car companies like toyota honda ford and bmw have pulled together to create a movement of hybrid vehicle sales pushed by washington lobbyist to lower the worlds emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumptioncitation needed in 2005 sales went beyond 200,000 hybrids but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by 200,000 gallons per day a tiny fraction of the 360 million gallons used per daycitation needed according to bradley berman author of driving changeone hybrid at a time cold economics shows that in real dollars except for a brief spike in the 1970s gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap fuel continues to represent a small part of the overall cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle82 other marketing tactics include greenwashing which is the unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue83 temma ehrenfeld explained in an article by newsweek hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate hybrid car companies have a long time to go if they expect to really go green according to harvard business professor theodore levitt states managing products and meeting customers needs you must adapt to consumer expectations and anticipation of future desires84 this means people buy what they want if they want a fuel efficient car they buy a hybrid without thinking about the actual efficiency of the product this green myopia as ottman calls it fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups secondly people find it rewarding to own the better newer flashier and so called greener car in the beginning of the hybrid movement car companies reached out to the young people by using top celebrities astronauts and popular tv shows to market hybrids this made the new technology of hybrids a status to obtain for many people and a must to be cool or even the practical choice for the time with the many benefits and status of owning a hybrid it is easy to think its the right thing to do but in fact may not be as green as it appearscitation needed adoption rateedit this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedias quality standards no cleanup reason has been specified please help improve this section if you can september 2010 learn how and when to remove this template message while the adoption rate for hybrids in the us is small today 2.2 of new car sales in 2011,85 this compares with a 17.1 share of new car sales in japan in 2011,86 and it has the potential to be very large over time as more models are offered and incremental costs decline due to learning and scale benefits however forecasts vary widely for instance bob lutz a long-time skeptic of hybrids indicated he expects hybrids will never comprise more than 10 of the us auto market87 other sources also expect hybrid penetration rates in the us will remain under 10 for many years888990 more optimistic views include predictions that hybrids would dominate new car sales in the us and elsewhere over the next 10 to 20 years91 another approach taken by saurin shah examines the penetration rates or s-curves of four analogs historical and current to hybrid and electrical vehicles in an attempt to gauge how quickly the vehicle stock could be hybridized andor electrified in the united states the analogs are 1 the electric motors in us factories in the early 20th century 2 diesel electric locomotives on us railways in the 19201945 period 3 a range of new automotive featurestechnologies introduced in the us over the past fifty years and 4 e-bike purchases in china over the past few years these analogs collectively suggest it would take at least 30 years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture 80 of the us passenger vehicle stock 92 european union 2020 regulation standardsedit the european parliament council and european commission has reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average co2 passenger car emissions to 95 gkm by 2020 according to a european commission press release according to the release the key details of the agreement are as follows emissions target the agreement will reduce average co2 emissions from new cars to 95 gkm from 2020 as proposed by the commission this is a 40 reduction from the mandatory 2015 target of 130 gkm the target is an average for each manufacturers new car fleet it allows oems to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more 2025 target the commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by end-2015 to take effect in 2025 this target will be in line with the eus long-term climate goals supercredits for low-emission vehicles the regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with co2 emissions of 50 gkm or less which will be electric or plug-in hybrid cars each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in 2020 1.67 in 2021 1.33 in 2022 and then as one vehicle from 2023 onwards these supercredits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet however to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation there will be a 2.5 gkm cap per manufacturer on the contribution that supercredits can make to their target in any year93 see alsoedit energy portal ecology portal sustainable development portal alternative propulsion bivalent engine diesel-electric efficient energy use
