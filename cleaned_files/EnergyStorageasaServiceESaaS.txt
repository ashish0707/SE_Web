energy storage as a service esaas pronounced iss allows a facility to benefit from the advantages of an energy storage system by entering into a service agreement without having to purchasing the system energy storage systems provide a range of services to generate revenue create savings and improve electricity resiliency the operation of the esaas system is a unique combination of an advanced battery storage system an energy management system and a service contract which can deliver value to a business by providing reliable power more economically contents 1 history 2 components 3 services 4 markets served 5 benefits 5.1 system benefactor does not require installation capital 5.2 system operated by a third-party system operator26 5.3 environmental 6 pricing 7 references historyedit the term esaas was developed and trademarked by constant power inc1 a toronto-based company in 2016 the service has been designed to work in the north american open electricity markets componentsedit esaas is the combination of an energy storage system a control and monitoring system and a service contract the most common energy storage systems used for esaas are lithium-ion2 or flow3 batteries due to their compact size non-invasive installation high efficiencies and fast reaction times but other storage mediums may be used such as compressed air4 flywheels5 or pumped hydro67 the batteries are sized based on the facilitys needs and is paired with a power inverter to convert the dc power to ac power in order to connect directly to the facilitys electricity supply esaas systems are remotely monitored and controlled by the esaas operator using a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system8 the scada communicates with the facilitys energy management system ems9 power conversion system pcs10 and battery management system bms11 the esaas operator is responsible for ensuring the esaas system is monitoring and responding to the facilitys needs as well as overriding commands to participate in regional incentive programs such as coincident peak management and demand response programs in real time the facility benefiting from the esaas system is linked to the esaas system operator through a service contract the contract specifies the length of the service term payment structure and list of services the facility wishes to participate in servicesedit esaas is used to perform a variety of services including coincident peak management12 during times of high regional demand independent service operators isosregional transmission organizations rtos offer incentives for facilities to reduce or curtail their load esaas allows a facility to isolate or offset their load during these high regional demand periods to decrease demand from the electricity grid to benefit from the incentives the system is designed to work in conjunction or independent of facility curtailment demand response13 isosrtos offer facilities payment for curtailing their energy demand when dispatched by the grid operator esaas allows facilities to participate in these programs by off-setting all or a portion of a facility load during a demand response occurrence a facility can benefit from the incentive without interrupting their facility operation power factor correction14 during charging and discharging active and reactive power may be balanced prior to supplying a facility by balancing the amount of active and reactive power to a facility the power factor and resulting facility electrical efficiency may be improved this improvement may reduce a facilitys monthly peak demand charge power quality15 esaas actively monitors electricity supply to a facility in times of intermittent power supply esaas acts as an uninterruptible power supply ups to ensure uninterrupted reliable power supply to eliminate unexpected fluctuations fluctuating and intermittent power affects equipment operation which may cause costly delays and defects in production back-up power16 if the electricity grid experiences a power outage esaas offers a back-up power service to continue powering all or a portion of a facilitys electricity demand depending on the size of the esaas installation esaas may maintain facility operation for the duration of a grid failure peak shaving17 esaas actively monitors a facilitys energy profile to normalize the electricity draw from the electricity grid the esaas system stores energy when the facility demand is lower than average and discharges the stored energy when the facility demand is higher than average the result is a steady draw of electricity from the electricity grid and a lower monthly peak demand charge energy arbitrage18 esaas actively monitors local electricity spot prices to store energy when the price is low to be utilized when electricity prices are high this is commonly referred to as arbitrage the net different in price results in cost savings market ancillary services19 esaas enables facilities to participate in the local isorto markets to provide services such as frequency regulation operating reserve and dispatchable generation by participating in the local market facilities can generate revenue through the esaas contract transmission support20 esaas may provide services to ease congestion and constraint on electricity transmission networks by storing energy during heavy transmission periods to be released during less congested periods the use of this service can prolong the life of infrastructure and defers system upgrades markets servededit esaas primarily benefits large energy consumers with an average demand of over 500kw,21 although the service may benefit smaller facilities depending on regional incentives22 current early adopters of esaas are manufacturers chemical electrical lighting metal petrochemical plastics commercial retail large offices medium offices multi-residential supermarkets public facilities colleges universities hotels hospitality schools and resources oil extraction pulp paper metals ore food processing greenhouses benefitsedit system benefactor does not require installation capitaledit to participate in an esaas service the installation system benefactor does not require any capital outlay23 upon installing an esaas service the facility sees immediate savings andor revenue generation initial capital is often a hurdle for facilities to adopt an energy storage system since in most cases the payback period24 of an energy storage system is 510 years25 system operated by a third-party system operator26edit esaas is a contracted service27 that is automatically controlled by a third party this eliminates responsibility for the facility28 to allocate resources to manage their energy profile allowing a facility to operate their core business the system operators have knowledge of local electricity sectors that continually monitor and update29 system protocols as regional markets change the information is used to optimize the value realized by the esaas system while still meeting facility requirements environmentaledit for most esaas services energy is stored during night time off-peak hours when energy production is created from non-carbon emitting sources30 the energy is then used to offset the required carbon emitting31 production during peak-times the load shifting capability provided by esaas displaces heavy emitting generation requirements pricingedit esaas contracts have a fixed monthly price over a contracted term32 the fixed price is based on potential economic benefit and applicable programs in the region of deployment the esaas contract price is always less than the economic value provided by the service to ensure the client retains a net positive value through the service referencesedit
