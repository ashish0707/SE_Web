see also timeline of hydrogen technologies this article is incomplete please help to improve it or discuss the issue on the talk page february 2009 hydrogen technologies are technologies that relate to the production and use of hydrogen hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses some hydrogen technologies are carbon neutral and could have a role in preventing climate change and a possible future hydrogen economy hydrogen is a widely used chemical used in various applications including ammonia production oil refining and energy1 hydrogen is not a primary energy source because it is not naturally occurring as a fuel it is however widely regarded as an ideal energy storage medium due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through electrolysis and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell there are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells2 the potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel contents 1 fuel cells 2 hydrogen infrastructure 2.1 hydrogen storage 3 hydrogen vehicles 3.1 historic hydrogen filled airships 3.2 hydrogen powered cars 3.3 hydrogen powered planes 3.4 hydrogen powered rockets 4 related technologies 4.1 environmental 4.2 nuclear 4.3 organic chemistry 5 miscellaneous 6 see also 7 references fuel cellsedit main article fuel cell further information glossary of fuel cell terms alkaline fuel cell afc direct borohydride fuel cell dbfc direct carbon fuel cell dcfc direct-ethanol fuel cell defc direct methanol fuel cell dmfc electro-galvanic fuel cell egfc flow battery rfc formic acid fuel cell fafc metal hydride fuel cell mhfc microbial fuel cell mfc molten-carbonate fuel cell mcfc phosphoric-acid fuel cell pafc photoelectrochemical cell pec proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc protonic ceramic fuel cell pcfc regenerative fuel cell rfc solid-oxide fuel cell sofc v t e fuel cells by electrolyte alkaline fuel cell molten carbonate fuel cell phosphoric acid fuel cell proton exchange membrane fuel cell solid oxide fuel cell by fuel direct-ethanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell formic acid fuel cell reformed methanol fuel cell zinc-air battery biofuel cells enzymatic biofuel cell microbial fuel cell others blue energy direct borohydride fuel cell direct carbon fuel cell electro-galvanic fuel cell flow battery membraneless fuel cells metal hydride fuel cell photoelectrochemical cell protonic ceramic fuel cell regenerative fuel cell solid oxide electrolyser cell unitized regenerative fuel cell hydrogen economy storage station vehicle glossary hydrogen infrastructureedit main article hydrogen infrastructure hydrogen pipeline transport hydrogen pressure letdown station compressed hydrogen tube trailer liquid hydrogen tank truck hydrogen piping hydrogen station hcng homefueler home energy station hydrogen highway zero regio hydrogen compressor electrochemical hydrogen compressor guided rotor compressor hydride compressor ionic liquid piston compressor linear compressor hydrogen turboexpander-generator hydrogen leak testing hydrogen sensor hydrogen purifier hydrogen analyzer hydrogen valve hydrogen storageedit main article hydrogen storage compressed hydrogen cryo-adsorption liquid hydrogen slush hydrogen underground hydrogen storage hydrogen tank power to gas hydrogen vehiclesedit main article hydrogen vehicles further information list of fuel cell vehicles historic hydrogen filled airshipsedit hindenburg airship zeppelin hydrogen powered carsedit hydrogen fueling nozzle audi 2004 -
