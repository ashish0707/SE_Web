csiro division of mathematics the australian national research organisation on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids1 he became a principal research scientist and leader of the applied mathematics group in csiro2 he left csiro in 1985 after the organisation had terminated all research on renewable energy from 1996 to 2001 he was professor of environmental science and

development3 based on his belief that science technology and economics should serve the community at large dr diesendorf has been at various times the secretary of the society for social responsibility in science australian capital territory president of the australia new zealand society for ecological economics co-founder and vice-president of the sustainable energy industries council of australia and co-founder and president of the original australasian wind energy association3 much of his recent and current research is on climate mitigation especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100 renewable energy to this end he is involved with colleagues in the centre for energy environmental markets at unsw in scenario development computer simulation modelling and energy policy previously dr diesendorf was one of the leading proponents calling for the ethical scientific debate over public water fluoridation4 on this issue diesendorf has authored several papers including a major 1986 article entitled the mystery of declining tooth decay in the journal nature examining the need for a scientific re-evaluation of fluoridation and has highlighted some of the contrary evidence15 books and recent peer-reviewed publicationsedit books diesendorf m 2014 sustainable energy solutions for climate change routledge-earthscan and unsw press isbn
