sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker switchboard transformer wiring by region or country hong kong north america united kingdom v t e a residual-current device rcd or residual-current circuit breaker rccb is a device that instantly breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock injury may still occur in some cases for example if a human falls after receiving a shock in the united states and canada the device is more commonly known as a ground fault circuit interrupter gfci ground fault interrupter gfi or an appliance leakage current interrupter alci in the united kingdom these are better known by their initials rcd and a combined rcdmcb is known as a rcbo residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection in australia they are sometimes known as safety switches or a rcd an earth leakage circuit breaker elcb may be a residual-current device although an older type of voltage-operated earth leakage circuit breaker also exists in german-speaking countries the device is sometimes known as fi where the f stands for fault fehler and i for the symbol that represents electric current these electrical wiring devices disconnect a circuit when it detects that the electric current is not balanced between the energized line conductors and the return neutral conductor under normal circumstances these two wires are expected to carry matching currents and any difference usually indicates that a short circuit or other electrical anomaly is present even a small leakage current can mean a risk of harm or death due to electric shock if the leaking electric current passes through a human a current of around 30ma 0.030amperes is potentially sufficient to cause cardiac arrest or serious harm if it persists for more than a small fraction of a second rcdsrccbs are designed to disconnect the conducting wires quickly enough to prevent serious injury from such shocks this is commonly described as the rcdrccb being tripped an rcd does not provide protection against unexpected or dangerously high current when current is flowing in the usual wires in the circuit therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent overload or short circuits if the fault does not lead to current leakage therefore rcds are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker such as a fuse or miniature circuit breaker mcb which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit rcbo rcd w overcurrent protection rcds also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time since the flow of current through an expected device an unexpected route or a human are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor rcds are usually testable and resettable devices commonly they include a button that when pressed safely creates a small leakage condition and a switch that reconnects the conductors when a fault condition has been cleared depending upon their design some rcds disconnect both the energized and return conductors upon a fault while others only disconnect the energized conductor and rely upon the return conductor being at ground earth potential the former are commonly known as double-pole designs the latter as single-pole designs if the fault has left the return wire floating or not at its expected ground potential for any reason then a single-pole rcd will leave this conductor still connected to the circuit when it detects the fault a two-pole or double-pole residual-current device the test button and connectdisconnect switch are colored blue a fault will trigger the switch to its down off position which in this device would

south africa 7.12 turkey 7.13 united kingdom 8 see also 9 references 10 external links purpose and operationedit rcds are designed to disconnect the circuit if there is a leakage current by detecting small leakage currents typically 530 ma and disconnecting quickly enough 300 ms they may prevent electrocution they are an essential part of the automatic disconnection of supply ads ie to switch off when a fault develops rather than rely on human intervention one of the essential tenets of modern electrical practice there are also rcds with intentionally slower responses and lower sensitivities designed to protect equipment or avoid starting electrical fires but not disconnect unnecessarily the equipment with greater leakage currents in normal operation to prevent electrocution rcds should operate within 2540 milliseconds with any leakage currents through a person of greater than 30 ma before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation the most common cause of death through electric shock by contrast conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive which may be thousands of times the leakage current an rcd responds to a small leakage current such as through a person can be a very serious fault but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit and certainly not do so fast enough to save a life rcds operate by measuring the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer this measures the difference between current flowing through the live conductor and that returning through the neutral conductor if these do not sum to zero there is a leakage of current to somewhere else to earthground or to another circuit and the device will open its contacts operation does not require a fault current to return through the earth wire in the installation the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing contact with the ground or any other current path automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete residual-current detection is complementary to over-current detection residual-current detection cannot provide protection for overload or short-circuit currents except for the special case of a short circuit from live to ground not live to neutral for a rcd used with three-phase power all three live conductors and the neutral if fitted must pass through the current transformer typical designedit internal mechanism of rcd opened 3-phase residual-current device the diagram depicts the internal mechanism of a residual-current device rcd the device is designed to be wired in-line in an appliance power cord it is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 a and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 ma this is an active rcd that is it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation some early rcds were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the current transformer as these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant the incoming supply and the neutral conductors are connected to the terminals at 1 and the outgoing load conductors are connected to the terminals at 2 the earth conductor not shown is connected through from supply to load uninterrupted when the reset button 3 is pressed the contacts 4 and another hidden behind 5 close allowing current to pass the solenoid 5 keeps the contacts closed when the reset button is released the sense coil 6 is a differential current transformer which surrounds but is not electrically connected to the live and neutral conductors in normal operation all the current down the live conductor returns up the neutral conductor the currents in the two conductors are therefore equal and opposite and cancel each other out any fault to earth for example caused by a person touching a live component in the attached appliance causes some of the current to take a different return path which means that there is an imbalance difference in the current in the two conductors single-phase case or more generally a nonzero sum of currents from among various conductors for example three phase conductors and one neutral conductor this difference causes a current in the sense coil 6 which is picked up by the sense circuitry 7 the sense circuitry then removes power from the solenoid 5 and the contacts 4 are forced apart by a spring cutting off the electricity supply to the appliance the device is designed so that the current is interrupted in milliseconds greatly reducing the chances of a dangerous electric shock being received the test button 8 allows the correct operation of the device to be verified by passing a small current through the orange test wire 9 this simulates a fault by creating an imbalance in the sense coil if the rcd does not trip when this button is pressed then the device must be replaced rcd with additional overcurrent protection circuitry rcbo or gfci breakeredit residual-current and overcurrent protection may be combined in one device for installation into the service panel this device is known as a gfci ground fault circuit interrupter breaker in the usa and canada and as an rcbo residual-current circuit breaker with overload protection in europe in the us gfci breakers are more expensive than gfci outletscitation needed as well as requiring both line and neutral inputs and outputs or full 3-phase many gfcircbo devices require a functional earth fe connection this serves to provide both emc immunity and to reliably operate the device if the input-side neutral connection is lost but live and earth remain for reasons of space many devices especially in din rail format use flying leads rather than screw terminals especially for the neutral input and fe connections additionally because of the small form factor the output cables of some models eatonmem are used to form the primary winding of the rcd part and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the current transformer part around it this can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals rather than from the final circuit wiring having one rcd feeding another is generally unnecessary provided they have been wired properly one exception is the case of a tt earthing system where the earth loop impedance may be high meaning that a ground fault might not cause sufficient current to trip an ordinary circuit breaker or fuse in this case a special 100 ma or greater trip current time-delayed rcd is installed covering the whole installation and then more sensitive rcds should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk chints rcbo schneider electric shihlin electric abb typical us afcigfci rcd with additional arc fault protection circuitryedit in addition to ground fault circuit interrupters gfcis arc-fault circuit interrupter devices afci are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring as well as extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets by detecting hazardous arc-faults and responding by interrupting power afcis helps reduce the likelihood of the homes electrical system being an ignition source of a fire dual function afcigfci devices offer both electrical fire prevention and shock prevention in one device making them a solution for many rooms in the home especially when replacing an existing standard receptacle or existing ungrounded receptacle common features and variationsedit differences in disconnection actionsedit major differences exist regarding the manner in which an rcd will act to disconnect the power to a circuit or appliance two differing nomenclatures are in use to identify what is essentially the main feature viz either active or passive and latched or non-latching all rcds have a latching feature the latch becomes set when the device is armed - typically by moving a switch to the on position or depressing a reset button once armed the device permits power to flow until some electrical event occurs that causes the latch to become un-set that trigger is normally intended to be the detection of a serious electrical irregularity but un-latching can also occur by the disconnection of the power such power-disconnection is not regarded as an irregular event and includes such events as a user disconnecting the power intentionally or unintentionally or a temporary power failure attributed to the electricity service provider active rcds operate to un-latch themselves when any irregular power event occurs and that includes any simple power-disconnection caused by any means whatsoever no automatic re-connection operation follows the cessation of whatever caused the rcd to be triggered the power to the circuit or appliance will remain disconnected until the rcd has been manually reset by the user passive rcds operate to un-latch themselves solely when the power irregularity appears to be a serious electrical fault however except where the power has been disconnected by the rcd un-latching itself or by the user manually triggering the device the rcd will remain latched throughout any period when the power is not connected and remain latched and ready to continue usage in its armed mode as soon as the power supply is restored rcds installed as fixed devices within a consumer power distribution unit are almost always of the passive variety so that household appliances such as refrigerators and freezers will return to their regular mode of operation as soon as the power supply resumes normal operation rcds of a portable type are mostly of the active variety and all trigger events will cause them to un-latch the settings - specifically to avoid power resumption when the power supply previously disconnected by the rcd itself is restored this type of action is particularly desirable with appliances such as power tools and garden machinery that could become dangerous if they were re-activated without personal supervision such portable rcd types are generally active types of either a plug-top design intended to be hard-wired to an individual appliance or as plug-in units to fit between an appliance plug and a wall-socket or built-in to extension cables however it is possible to obtain a few types of passive latched devices for permanent attachment directly to an appliance power cord or for incorporation into the power line of selected appliances - sometimes embodied within a manually-wired plug top form such as the british rectangular blade variety there is a presumption that a passive rcd will have been fitted both solely and directly to appropriate equipment a further variety of fitting for an rcd is by incorporation within a wall-socket where a choice of either active or passive fittings are available - on the presumption that the user will be aware of the nature of the appliances to be so connected and will restrict the usage of such wall sockets accordingly passive rcds tend to be made in the 30 milliamp 40 millisecond rating and higher within a cpdu for special purposes the active varieties are often available in lower trip ratings as low as 10 ma and more choice of those lower ratings may be available their trip timing is often 30 milliseconds all currents expressed here are at 250 volts lower ratings in rcds are more prone to cause nuisance tripping for no necessarily obvious reason number of poles and pole terminologyedit the number of poles represents the number of conductors that are interrupted when a fault condition occurs rcds used on single-phase ac supplies two current paths such as domestic power are usually one- or two-pole designs also known as single- and double-pole a single-pole rcd interrupts only the energized conductor while a double-pole rcd interrupts both the energized and return conductors in a single-pole rcd the return conductor is usually anticipated to be at ground potential at all times and therefore safe on its own however see limitations below rcds with three or more poles can be used on three-phase ac supplies three current paths or to disconnect an earth conductor as well with four-pole rcds used to interrupt three-phase neutral supplies specially designed rcds can also be used with both ac and dc power distribution systems the following terms are sometimes used to describe the manner in which conductors are connected and disconnected by an rcd single-pole sp one-pole - the rcd will disconnect the energized wire only double-pole dp two-pole - the rcd will disconnect both the energized and return wires 1n and 1pn non-standard terms used in the context of rcbos at times used differently by different manufacturers typically these terms may signify that the return neutral conductor is an isolating pole only without a protective element an unprotected but switched neutral or that the rcbo provides a conducting path and connectors for the return neutral conductor but this path remains uninterrupted when a fault occurs sometimes known as solid neutral2 or that both conductors are disconnected for some faults such as rcd detected leakage but only one conductor is disconnected for other faults such as overload3 sensitivityedit rcd sensitivity is expressed as the rated residual operating current noted in preferred values have been defined by the iec thus making it possible to divide rcds into three groups according to their in value high sensitivity hs 6 10 30 ma for direct-contact life injury protection medium sensitivity ms 100 300 500 1000 ma for fire protection low sensitivity ls 3 10 30 a typically for protection of machine note that the nominal value of residual current indicated above is not an absolute value more information is presented below break time response speededit there are two groups of devices g general use for instantaneous rcds ie without a time delay minimal break time immediate must never trip at 0.5 in maximal break time 200 ms for 1 in 150 ms for 2 in and 40 ms for 5 in s selective or t time-delayed for rcds with a short time delay typically used at the origin of an installation for fire protection to discriminate withgdevices at the loads and in circuits containing surge suppressors must never trip at 0.5 in minimal break time 130 ms for 1 in 60 ms for 2 in and 50 ms for 5 in maximal break time 500 ms for 1 in 200 ms for 2 in and 150 ms for 5 in programmable earth fault relays are available to allow tiered installations to minimise outage eg 300ma 300msec at origin feeding several 100ma s type at each sub-board and 30ma g type for each final circuit type or mode types of current leakage issue detectededit standard iec 60755 general requirements for residual current operated protective devices defines three types of rcd depending on the characteristics of the fault current type ac rcd for which tripping is ensured for residual sinusoidal alternating currents type a rcd for which tripping is ensured as for type ac for residual pulsating direct currents for residual pulsating direct currents superimposed by a smooth direct current of 6ma with or without phase-angle control independent of the polarity type b rcd for which tripping is ensured as for type a for residual sinusoidal currents up to 1khz for residual sinusoidal currents superposed by a pure direct current for pulsating direct currents superposed by a pure direct current for residual currents that may result from rectifying circuits three-pulse star connection or six-pulse bridge connection two-pulse bridge connection line-to-line with or without phase-angle monitoring independently of the polarity surge current resistanceedit the surge current refers to the peak current an rcd is designed to withstand using a test impulse of specified characteristics an 820 sclarify impulse named after the time constants of the rise and fall of current the iec 61008 and iec 61009 standards impose the use of a 0.5 s of 100khz damped oscillator wave ring wave to test the ability of residual-current protection devices to withstand operational discharges with a peak current equal to 200 a with regard to atmospheric discharges iec 61008 and 61009 standards establish the 820 sclarify surge current test with 3 ka peak current but limit the requirement to rcds classified as selective a ground fault circuit interrupter circuit breaker gfci breaker in usa and canada and residual-current breaker with overload rcbo in europe are devices that combine the functions of a residual-current device with a circuit breaker they detect both supply imbalance and overload current in europe rcds can fit on the same din rail as the mcbs however the busbar arrangements in consumer units and distribution boards can make it awkward to use them in this way if it is desired to protect an individual circuit an rcbo residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection can be used this incorporates an rcd and a miniature circuit breaker in one device electrical plugs with incorporated rcd are sometimes installed on appliances that might be considered to pose a particular safety hazard for example long extension leads which might be used outdoors or garden equipment or hair dryers which may be used near a bath or sink occasionally an in-line rcd may be used to serve a similar function to one in a plug by putting the rcd in the extension lead protection is provided at whatever outlet is used even if the building has old wiring such as knob and tube or wiring that does not contain a grounding conductor in north america gfi receptacles can be used in cases where there is no grounding conductor but they must be labeled as ungrounded an ungrounded gfi receptacle will trip using the built-in test button but will not trip using a gfi test plug because the plug tests by shorting a small current from line to the non-existent ground electrical sockets with included rcds are becoming common testing of correct operationedit rcds can be tested with built-in test button to confirm functionality on a regular basis rcds may not operate correctly if wired improperly so they are generally tested by the installer to verify correct operation use of a solenoid voltmeter from live to earth provides an external path and can test the wiring to the rcd such a test may be performed on installation of the device and at any downstream outlet limitationsedit a residual-current circuit breaker cannot remove all risk of electric shock or fire in particular an rcd alone will not detect overload conditions phase-to-neutral short circuits or phase-to-phase short circuits see three-phase electric power over-current protection fuses or circuit breakers must be provided circuit breakers that combine the functions of an rcd with overcurrent protection respond to both types of fault these are known as rcbos and are available in 2- 3- and 4-pole configurations rcbos will typically have separate circuits for detecting current imbalance and for overload current but use a common interrupting mechanism an rcd helps to protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from a phase live line hot to earth it cannot protect against electric shock when current flows through a person from phase to neutral or from phase to phase for example where a finger touches both live and neutral contacts in a light fitting a device cannot differentiate between current flow through an intended load from flow through a person though the rcd may still trip if the person is in contact with the ground earth as some current may still pass through the persons finger and body to earth whole installations on a single rcd common in older installations in the uk are prone to nuisance trips that can cause secondary safety problems with loss of lighting and defrosting of food frequently the trips are caused by deteriorating insulation on heater elements such as water heaters and cooker elements or rings although regarded as a nuisance the fault is with the deteriorated element and not the rcd replacement of the offending element will resolve the problem but replacing the rcd will not in the case of rcds that need a power supply a dangerous condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off on the supply side of the rcd while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted the tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails connected equipment will not work without a neutral but the rcd cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire for this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire two-pole breakers or four-pole for 3-phase must be used to provide some protection with an interrupted neutral some rcds and rcbos are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board this either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply causing the device to trip or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry enabling it to continue to function normally in the absence of the supply neutral related to this a single-pole rcdrcbo interrupts the energized conductor only while a double-pole device interrupts both the energized and return conductors usually this is a standard and safe practice since the return conductor is held at ground potential anyway however because of its design a single-pole rcd will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations for example where the return conductor is not being held as expected at ground potential or where current leakage occurs between the return and earth conductors in these cases a double-pole rcd will offer protection since the return conductor would also be disconnected history and nomenclatureedit the worlds first high-sensitivity earth leakage protection system ie a system capable of protecting people from the hazards of direct contact between a live conductor and earth was a second-harmonic magnetic amplifier core-balance system known as the magamp developed in south africa by henri rubin electrical hazards were of great concern in south african gold mines and rubin an engineer at the company fwj electrical industries initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525 v and had a tripping sensitivity of 250 ma prior to this core balance earth leakage protection systems operated at sensitivities of about 10 a the cold cathode system was installed in a number of gold mines and worked reliably however rubin began working on a completely novel system with greatly improved sensitivity and by early 1956 he had produced a prototype second-harmonic magnetic amplifier-type core balance system south african patent no 226856 and australian patent no 218360 the prototype magamp was rated at 220 v 60 a and had an internally adjustable tripping sensitivity of 12.517.5 ma very rapid tripping times were achieved through a novel design and this combined with the high sensitivity was well within the safe current-time envelope for ventricular fibrillation determined by charles dalziel of the university of california berkeley usa who had estimated electrical shock hazards in humans this system with its associated circuit breaker included overcurrent and short-circuit protection in addition the original prototype was able to trip at a lower sensitivity in the presence of an interrupted neutral thus protecting against an important cause of electrical fire following the accidental electrocution of a woman in a domestic accident at the stilfontein gold mining village near johannesburg a few hundred fwj 20 ma magamp earth leakage protection units were installed in the homes of the mining village during 1957 and 1958 fwj electrical industries which later changed its name to fw electrical industries continued to manufacture 20 ma single phase and three phase magamp units at the time that he worked on the magamp rubin also considered using transistors in this application but concluded that the early transistors then available were too unreliable however with the advent of improved transistors the company that he worked for and other companies later produced transistorized versions of earth leakage protection in 1961 dalziel working with rucker manufacturing co developed a transistorized device for earth leakage protection which became known as a ground fault circuit interrupter gfci sometimes colloquially shortened to ground fault interrupter gfi this name for high-sensitivity earth leakage protection is still in common use in the usa45678 in the early 1970s most north american gfci devices were of the circuit breaker type gfcis built into the outlet receptacle became commonplace beginning in the 1980s the circuit breaker type installed into a distribution panel suffered from accidental trips mainly caused by poor or inconsistent insulation on the wiring false trips were frequent when insulation problems were compounded by long circuit lengths so much current leaked along the length of the conductors insulation that the breaker might trip with the slightest increase of current imbalance the migration to outlet receptacle based protection in north american installations reduced the accidental trips and provided obvious verification that wet areas were under electrical code-required protection european installations continue to use primarily rcds installed at the distribution board which provides protection in case of damage to fixed wiring in europe socket-based rcds are primarily used for retro-fitting regulation and adoptionedit this section needs additional citations for verification

2004 this rule was introduced in rg-16062004-25494 17 united kingdomedit the previous 16th edition of the iee electrical wiring regulations required use of rcds for socket outlets that were liable to be used by outdoor appliances normal practice in domestic installationscitation needed was to use a single rcd to cover all the circuits requiring rcd protection typically sockets and showers but to have some circuits typically lighting not rcd protected this was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the rcd trip protection arrangements for other circuits varied to implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an rcd in what is known as a split load configuration where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch or time delay rcd in the case of a tt earth and a second group of circuits is supplied via the rcd this arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative earth leakage currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the rcd and that tripping of the rcd would disconnect power from all the protected circuits the current edition 17th of the regulations requires that all socket outlets in most domestic installations have rcd protection though there are exemptions cables buried in walls must also be rcd protected again with some specific exemptions refer to 17th edition amendment 1 effective from january 2012 provision of rcd protection for circuits present in bathrooms and shower rooms reduces the requirement for supplementary bonding in those locations two rcds may be used to cover the installation with upstairs and downstairs lighting and power circuits spread across both rcds when one rcd trips power is maintained to at least one lighting and power circuit other arrangements such as the use of rcbos may be employed to meet the regulations the new requirements for rcds do not affect most existing installations unless they are rewired the distribution board is changed a new circuit is installed or alterations are made such as additional socket outlets or new cables buried in walls rcds used for shock protection must be of the immediate operation type not time-delayed and must have a residual current sensitivity of no greater than 30 ma if it can be shown that spurious tripping would cause a greater problem than the risk of the electrical accident the rcd is supposed to prevent examples might be a supply to a critical factory process or to life support equipment rcds may be omitted providing affected circuits are clearly labelled and the balance of risks considered this may include the provision of alternative safety measures see alsoedit energy portal insulation monitoring device domestic ac
