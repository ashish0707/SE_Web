officially the italian republic italian repubblica italiana78910 is a unitary parliamentary republic in europenote 1 located in the heart of the mediterranean sea italy shares open land borders with france switzerland austria slovenia san marino and vatican city italy covers an area of 301,338km2 116,347sqmi and has a largely temperate seasonal climate or mediterranean climate due to its shape it is often referred to in italy as lo stivale the boot1112 with 61 million inhabitants it is the third most populous eu member state since classical times ancient phoenicians and greeks etruscans and celts have inhabited the south centre and north of the italian peninsula respectively with various italic peoples dispersed throughout italy alongside other ancient italian tribes and greek carthaginian and phoenician colonies the italic tribe known as the latins formed the roman kingdom which eventually spread throughout italy assimilating and conquering other nearby civilisations and forming the roman republic rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural political and religious centre of western civilisation the legacy of the roman empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law republican governments christianity and the latin script during the middle ages italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping commerce and banking and even laid the groundwork for capitalism13 these independent city-states and regional republics acting as europes main port of entry for asian and near eastern imported goods often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout europe at the time though much of central italy remained under the control of the theocratic papal states while southern italy remained largely feudal partially as a result of a succession of byzantine arab norman spanish and bourbon conquests of the region14 the renaissance began in italy and spread to the rest of europe bringing a renewed interest in humanism science exploration and art with the start of the modern era italian culture flourished at this time producing famous scholars artists and polymaths such as leonardo da vinci galileo michelangelo and machiavelli explorers from italy such as marco polo christopher columbus amerigo vespucci and giovanni da verrazzano discovered new routes to the far east and the new world helping to usher in the european age of discovery nevertheless italys importance as a hub of commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the new world as new world imports and trade routes became more influential in europe and bypassed the east asian and mediterranean trade routes that the italian city-states had dominated141516 furthermore the italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the italian wars of the 15th and 16th centuries a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighbouring european powers italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to conquest occupation and general foreign domination by european powers such as france spain and austria subsequently entering a long period of decline by the mid-19th century a rising movement in support of italian nationalism and italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the risorgimento which sought to bring about a rebirth of italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the italian peninsula and insular italy into an independent and unified nation-state after various unsuccessful attempts the italian wars of independence the expedition of the thousand and the capture of rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division17 from the late 19th century to the early 20th century the new kingdom of italy rapidly industrialised especially in the so-called industrial triangle of milan turin and genoa in the north and soon acquired a small colonial empire1819 however the southern areas of the country remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation fuelling a large and influential diaspora despite being one of the main victors in world war i italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil leading the way to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922 the subsequent participation in world war ii on the axis side ended in military defeat economic destruction and a civil war following the rise of the italian resistance movement in the years that followed italy

etymology main article name of italy the assumptions on the etymology of the name italia are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide28 according to one of the more common explanations the term italia from latin italia29 was borrowed through greek from the oscan vteli meaning land of young cattle cf lat vitulus calf umb vitlo calf30 the bull was a symbol of the southern italic tribes and was often depicted goring the roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free italy during the social war greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that italy was named after italus31 mentioned also by aristotle32 and thucydides33 the name italia originally applied only to a part of what is now southern italy according to antiochus of syracuse the southern portion of the bruttium peninsula modern calabria province of reggio and part of the provinces of catanzaro and vibo valentia but by his time oenotria and italy had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of lucania as well the greeks gradually came to apply the name italia to a larger region but it was during the reign of emperor augustus end of the 1st century bc that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the alps34 history main article history of italy prehistory and antiquity main articles prehistoric

in the 8th and 7th centuries bc greek colonies were established all along the coast of sicily and the southern part of the italian peninsula became known as magna graecia also the phoenicians established colonies on the coasts of sardinia and sicily rome a settlement around a ford on the river tiber conventionally founded in 753 bc grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from britain to the borders of persia and engulfing the whole mediterranean basin in which greek and roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation the roman legacy has

the fall of the western roman empire italy was seized by the ostrogoths42 followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under byzantine emperor justinian the invasion of another germanic tribe the lombards late in the same century reduced the byzantine presence to a rump realm the exarchate of ravenna and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years the lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the frankish empire by charlemagne in the late 8th century the franks also helped the formation of the papal states in central italy until the 13th century italian politics was dominated by the relations between the holy roman emperors and the papacy with most of the italian city-states siding for the former ghibellines or for the latter guelphs from momentary convenience43 painting of marco polo the venetian explorer of the 13th century it was during this chaotic era that italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution the medieval commune given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the empire and the holy see local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order44 in 1176 a league of city-states the lombard league defeated the german emperor frederick barbarossa at the battle of legnano thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central italian cities in coastal and southern areas the maritime republics the most notable being venice genoa pisa and amalfi heavily involved in the crusades grew to eventually dominate the mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the orient45 in the south sicily had become an islamic emirate in the 9th century thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine principalities of southern italy46 through a complex series of events southern italy developed as a unified kingdom first under the house of hohenstaufen then under the capetian house of anjou and from the 15th century the house of aragon in sardinia the former byzantine provinces became independent states known as giudicati although some parts of the island were under genoese or pisan control until the aragonese conquered it in the 15th century the black death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on italy by killing perhaps one third of the population4748 however the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities trade and economy which allowed the bloom of humanism and renaissance that later spread in europe early modern leonardo da vinci the quintessential renaissance man self portrait c 1512 explorer christopher columbus discovering americas and paving the way to trade roads and the conquistadors conquests in the 14th and 15th centuries northern-central italy was divided into a number of warring city-states the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger papal states and the kingdom of sicily referred to here as naples though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers as in the case of the duchy of milan which was officially a constituent state of the mainly germanic holy roman empire the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized italian lands following the collapse of the western roman empire the strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the signorie regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties war between the city-states was endemic and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri bands of soldiers drawn from around europe especially germany and switzerland led largely by italian captains49 decades of fighting eventually saw florence milan and venice emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the peace of lodi in 1454 which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries this peace would hold for the next forty years the renaissance a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture originated in italy thanks to a number of factors as the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities the patronage of its dominant families like the medici of florence5051 and the migration of greek scholars and texts to italy following the conquest of constantinople at the hands of the ottoman turks525354 the italian renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the italian wars the ideas and ideals of the renaissance soon spread into northern europe france england and much of europe in the meantime the discovery of the americas the new routes to asia discovered by the portuguese and the rise of the ottoman empire all factors which eroded the traditional italian dominance in trade with the east caused a long economic decline in the peninsula following the italian wars 1494 to 1559 ignited by the rivalry between france and spain the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination first under spain 1559 to 1713 and then austria 1713 to 1796 in 16291631 a new outburst of plague claimed about 14 of italys population55 in addition as the spanish empire started to decline in the 17th century so did its possessions in naples sicily sardinia and milan in particular southern italy was impoverished and cut off from the mainstream of events in europe56 in the 18th century as a result of the war of spanish succession austria replaced spain as the dominant foreign power while the house of savoy emerged as a regional power expanding to piedmont and sardinia in the same century the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling lites57 during the napoleonic wars northern-central italy was invaded and reorganised as a new kingdom of italy a client state of the french empire58 while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by joachim murat napoleons brother-in-law who was crowned as king of naples the 1814 congress of vienna restored the situation of the late 18th century but the ideals of

party attempted a coup the march on rome which failed but at the last minute king victor emmanuel iii refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed mussolini prime minister over the next few years mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties thus forming a dictatorship these actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as nazi germany and francoist spain in 1935 mussolini invaded ethiopia resulting in an international alienation and leading to italys withdrawal from the league of nations italy allied with nazi germany and the empire of japan and strongly supported francisco franco in the spanish civil war in 1939 italy annexed albania a de facto protectorate for decades italy entered world war ii on 10 june
