food security is a condition related to the supply of food and individuals access to it concerns over food security have existed throughout history there is evidence of granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago with central authorities in civilizations including ancient china and ancient egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine at the 1974 world food conference the term food security was defined with an emphasis on supply food security they said is the availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices1 later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition the final report of the 1996 world food summit states that food security exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life23 household food security exists when all members at all times have access to enough food for an active healthy life4 individuals who are food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation5 food insecurity on the other hand is a situation of limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways according to the united states department of agriculture usda6 food security incorporates a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factors including droughts shipping disruptions fuel shortages economic instability and wars7 in the years 2011-2013 an estimated 842 million people were suffering from chronic hunger8 the food and agriculture organization of the united nations or fao identified the four pillars of food security as availability access utilization and stability9 the united nations un recognized the right to food in the declaration of human rights in 1948,5 and has since noted that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights10 the 1996 world summit on food security declared that food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure3 according to the international centre for trade and sustainable development failed agriculture market regulation and the lack of

availability1112 in general the objective of food security indicators and measures is to capture some or all of the main components of food security in terms of food availability access and utilization or adequacy while availability production and supply and utilizationadequacy nutritional statusanthropometric measures seemed much easier to estimate thus more popular access ability to acquire sufficient quantity and quality remain largely elusive13 the factors influencing household food access are often context specific thus the financial and technical demands of collecting and analyzing data on all aspects of households experience of food access and the development of valid and clear measures remain a huge challenge14 nevertheless several measures have been developed that aim to capture the access component of food security with some notable examples developed by the usaid-funded food and nutrition technical assistance fanta project collaborating with cornell and tufts university and africare and world vision14151617 these include household food insecurity access scale hfias - continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity access in the household in the previous month household dietary diversity scale hdds - measures the number of different food groups consumed over a specific reference period 24hrs48hrs7days household hunger scale hhs- measures the experience of household food deprivation based on a set of predictable reactions captured through a survey and summarized in a scale coping strategies index csi - assesses household behaviours and rates them based on a set of varied established behaviours on how households cope with food shortages the methodology for this research is base on collecting data on a single question what do you do when you do not have enough food and do not have enough money to buy food181920 food insecurity is measured in the united states by questions in the census bureaus current population survey the questions asked are about anxiety that the household budget is inadequate to buy enough food inadequacy in the quantity or quality of food eaten by adults and children in the household and instances of reduced food intake or consequences of reduced food intake for adults and for children21 a national academy of sciences study commissioned by the usda criticized this measurement and the relationship of food security to hunger adding it is not clear whether hunger is appropriately identified as the extreme end of the food security scale22 the fao world food programme wfp and international fund for agricultural development ifad collaborate to produce the state of food insecurity in the world the 2012 edition described improvements made by the fao to the prevalence of undernourishment pou indicator that is used to measure rates of food insecurity new features include revised minimum dietary energy requirements for individual countries updates to the world population data and estimates of food losses in retail distribution for each country measurements that factor into the indicator include dietary energy supply food production food prices food expenditures and volatility of the food system23 the stages of food insecurity range from food secure situations to full-scale famine24 a new peer-reviewed journal of food security the science sociology and economics of food production and access to food began publishing in 2009.25 ratesedit number of people affected by undernourishment 201012 by region in millions data source fao26 with its prevalence of undernourishment pou indicator the fao reported that almost 870 million people were chronically undernourished in the years 2010-2012 this represents 12.5 of the global population or 1 in 8 people higher rates occur in developing countries where 852 million people about 15 of the population are chronically undernourished the report noted that asia and latin america have achieved reductions in rates of undernourishment that put these regions on track for achieving the millennium development goal of halving the prevalence of undernourishment by 2015.23 the un noted that about 2 billion people do not consume a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals27 in india the second-most populous country in the world 30 million people have been added to the ranks of the hungry since

states department of agriculture defines food insecurity as limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways42 national food security surveys are the main survey tool used by the usda to measure food security in the united states based on respondents answers to survey questions the household can be placed on a continuum of food security defined by the usda this continuum has four categories high food security marginal food security low food security and very low food security42 economic research service report number 155 ers-155 estimates that 14.5 percent 17.6 million of us households were food insecure at some point in 2012 the prevalence of food insecurity has been relatively in the united states since the economic recession 2008 in 2012 49.0 million people lived in food-insecure households 12.4 million adults lived in households with very low food security 8.3 million children lived in food-insecure households in which children along with adults were food insecure 977,000 children lived in households in which one or more child experienced very low food security43 feed the futureedit the government of the united states has taken up an initiative along with other local government agencies as well as global partners the g8 countries and donors to reduce global hunger and to improve food security conditions in the world exploiting the g8 summit of 2009 held in laquila italy president barack obama encouraged global leaders to revert the three-decade old trend of reduced agricultural investments and instead choose to increase cash flow in their respective agricultural sectors in a drive to bolster global food security this led to the birth of the feed the future program44 initially the us had been successful in collecting over 18 billion in funds for the program from the g8 countries as well as other donors the feed the future initiative is presently led by the us agency for international development and has the support of other government-funded bodies like the state department peace corps millennium challenge corporation the treasury department us trade representative overseas private investment corporation the us african development foundation and the us department of agriculture the target group of this initiative is the small holder farmers especially women feed the future has plans to help partner countries to develop their agricultural sector with an aim to improve their agricultural output a spurt in economic growth would ultimately lead to higher income and help to eradicate hunger and poverty as well as under nutrition from the society this initiative is expected to work on the basis of country-led priorities that call for consistent support by the governments donor organizations the private sector and the civil society to accomplish its long-term goals44 world summit on food securityedit the world summit on food security held in rome in 1996 aimed to renew a global commitment to the fight against hunger the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao called the summit in response to widespread under-nutrition and growing concern about the capacity of agriculture to meet future food needs the conference produced two key documents the rome declaration on world food security and the world food summit plan of action345 the rome declaration calls for the members of the united nations to work to halve the number of chronically undernourished people on the earth by the year 2015 the plan of action sets a number of targets for government and non-governmental organizations for achieving food security at the individual household national regional and global levels another world summit on food security took place in rome between november 16 and 18 2009 the decision to convene the summit was taken by the council of fao in june 2009 at the proposal of fao director-general dr jacques diouf heads of state and government attended the summit which took place at the faos headquarters pillars of food securityedit the who states that there are three pillars that determine food security food availability food access and food use46 the fao adds a fourth pillar the stability of the first three dimensions of food security over time5 in 2009 the world summit on food security stated that the four pillars of food security are availability access utilization and stability9 availabilityedit growth in food production has been greater than population growth food per person increased since 1961 data source food and agriculture organization food availability relates to the supply of food through production distribution and exchange47 food production is determined by a variety of factors including land ownership and use soil management crop selection breeding and management livestock breeding and management and harvesting48 crop production can be affected by changes in rainfall and temperatures47 the use of land water and energy to grow food often competes with other uses which can affect food production49 land used for agriculture can be used for urbanization or lost to desertification salinization and soil erosion due to unsustainable agricultural practices49 crop production is not required for a country to achieve food security nations dont have to have the natural resources required to produce crops in order to achieve food security as seen in the examples of japan50 and singapore51 because food consumers outnumber producers in every country51 food must be distributed to different regions or nations food distribution involves the storage processing transport packaging and marketing of food48 food-chain infrastructure and storage technologies on farms can also affect the amount of food wasted in the distribution process49 poor transport infrastructure can increase the price of supplying water and fertilizer as well as the price of moving food to national and global markets49 around the world few individuals or households are continuously self-reliant for food this creates the need for a bartering exchange or cash economy to acquire food47 the exchange of food requires efficient trading systems and market institutions which can affect food security52 per capita world food supplies are more than adequate to provide food security to all and thus food accessibility is a greater barrier to achieving food security51 accessedit goats are an important part of the solution to global food security because they are fairly low-maintenance and easy to raise and farm food access refers to the affordability and allocation of food as well as the preferences of individuals and households47 the un committee on economic social and cultural rights noted that the causes of hunger and malnutrition are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food usually due to poverty10 poverty can limit access to food and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes52 access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at prevailing prices or has sufficient land and other resources to grow its own food53 households with enough resources can overcome unstable harvests and local food shortages and maintain their access to food51 there are two distinct types of access to food direct access in which a household produces food using human and material resources and economic access in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere48 location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on53 the assets of a household including income land products of labor inheritances and gifts can determine a households access to food48 however the ability to access to sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services52 demographics and education levels of members of the household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household which influences the type of food that are purchased53 a households access to enough and nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake of all household members as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household52 the usda adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways without for example resorting to emergency food supplies scavenging stealing or other coping strategies4 utilizationedit the next pillar of food security is food utilization which refers to the metabolism of food by individuals51 once food is obtained by a household a variety of factors affect the quantity and quality of food that reaches members of the household in order to achieve food security the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual52 food safety affects food utilization47 and can be affected by the preparation processing and cooking of food in the community and household48 nutritional values47 of the household determine food choice48 and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social well-being54 access to healthcare is another determinant of food utilization since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized48 for example intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food utilization51 sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food utilization48 education about nutrition and food preparation can affect food utilization and improve this pillar of food security51 education bring accountability among peoplecreate awarenesswhich foster them for food security stabilityedit food stability refers to the ability to obtain food over time food insecurity can be transitory seasonal or chronic48 in transitory food insecurity food may be unavailable during certain periods of time52 at the food production level natural disasters52 and drought48 result in crop failure and decreased food availability civil conflicts can also decrease access to food52 instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity which can be caused by illness seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production48 chronic or permanent food insecurity is defined as the long-term persistent lack of adequate food52 in this case households are constantly at risk of being unable to acquire food to meet the needs of all members chronic and transitory food insecurity are linked since the reoccurrence of transitory food security can make households more vulnerable to chronic food insecurity48 effects of food insecurityedit famine and hunger are both rooted in food insecurity chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to famine and hunger ensuring food security presupposes elimination of that vulnerability24 stunting and chronic nutritional deficienciesedit see also malnutrition children with symptoms of low calorie and protein intake and a nurse attendant at a nigerian orphanage in the late 1960s many countries experience ongoing food shortages and distribution problems these result in chronic and often widespread hunger amongst significant numbers of people human populations can respond to chronic hunger and malnutrition by decreasing body size known in medical terms as stunting or stunted growth this process starts in utero if the mother is malnourished and continues through approximately the third year of life it leads to higher infant and child mortality but at rates far lower than during famines once stunting has occurred improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage stunting itself can be viewed as a coping mechanism bringing body size into alignment with the calories available during adulthood in the location where the child is born limiting body size as a way of adapting to low levels of energy calories adversely affects health in three ways premature failure of vital organs during adulthood for example a 50-year-old individual might die of heart failure because hisher heart suffered structural defects during early development stunted individuals suffer a higher rate of disease and illness than those who have not undergone stunting severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development55 it therefore creates disparity among children who did not experience severe malnutrition and those who did challenges to achieving food securityedit global water crisisedit see also water resource policy irrigation canals have opened dry desert areas of egypt to agriculture water deficits which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries56 may soon do the same in larger countries such as china or india57 the water tables are falling in scores of countries including northern china the us and india due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps other countries affected include pakistan afghanistan and iran this will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest even with the overpumping of its aquifers china is developing a grain deficit58 when this happens it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward most of the 3 billion people projected to be born worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages after china and india there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits afghanistan algeria egypt iran mexico and pakistan four of these already import a large share of their grain only pakistan remains self-sufficient but with a population expanding by 4 million a year it will likely soon turn to the world market for grain5960 regionally sub-saharan africa has the largest number of water-stressed countries of any other place on the globe and as of an estimated 800 million people who live in africa 300 million live in a water-stressed environment61 it is estimated that by 2030 75 million to 250 million people in africa will be living in areas of high water stress which will likely displace anywhere between 24 million and 700 million people as conditions become increasingly unlivable61 because the majority of africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and 80 to 90 percent of all families in rural africa rely upon producing their own food62 water scarcity translates to a loss of food security multimillion-dollar investments beginning in the 1990s by the world bank have reclaimed desert and turned the ica valley in peru one of the driest places on earth into the largest supplier of asparagus in the world however the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table in some places as much as eight meters per year one of the fastest rates of aquifer depletion in the world the wells of small farmers and local people are beginning to run dry and the water supply for the main city in the valley is under threat as a cash crop asparagus has provided jobs for local people but most of the money goes to the buyers mainly the british a 2010 report concluded that the industry is not sustainable and accuses investors including the world bank of failing to take proper responsibility for the effect of their decisions on the water resources of poorer countries63 diverting water from the headwaters of the ica river to asparagus fields has also led to a water shortage in the mountain region of huancavelica where indigenous communities make a marginal living herding64 land degradationedit see also land degradation and desertification intensive farming often leads to a vicious cycle of exhaustion of soil fertility and decline of agricultural yields65 approximately 40 percent of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded66 in africa if current trends of soil degradation continue the continent might be able to feed just 25 percent of its population by 2025 according to unus ghana-based institute for natural resources in africa67 climate changeedit see also climate change and agriculture extreme events such as droughts and floods are forecast to increase as climate change and global warming takes hold68 ranging from overnight floods to gradually worsening droughts these will have a range of effects on the agricultural sector by 2040 almost the entire nile region which once included large areas of irrigated agricultural land is expected to become hot desert where cultivation is impossible due to water limitation69 according to the climate development knowledge network report managing climate extremes and disasters in the agriculture sectors lessons from the ipcc srex report the effects will include changing productivity and livelihood patterns economic losses and effects on infrastructure markets and food security food security in future will be linked to our ability to adapt agricultural systems to extreme events for example the garifuna women in honduras are helping to ensure food security locally by reviving and improving production of traditional root crops building up traditional methods of soil conservation carrying out training in organic composting and pesticide use and creating the first garifuna farmers market sixteen towns have worked together to establish tool and seed banks efforts to plant wild fruit trees along the coast are helping to prevent soil erosion the aim is to reduce the communities vulnerability to the hazards of shifting weather patterns70 approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the himalayan rivers71 india china pakistan afghanistan bangladesh nepal and myanmar could experience floods followed by severe droughts in coming decades72 in india alone the ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people7374 the west coast of north america which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the rocky mountains and sierra nevada also would be affected75 glaciers arent the only worry that the developing nations have sea level is reported to rise as climate change progresses reducing the amount of land available for agriculture7677 in other parts of the world a big effect will be low yields of grain according to the world food trade model specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located from this the price of grain will rise along with the developing nations trying to grow the grain due to this every 22.5 price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1citation needed low crop yields are just one of the problem facing farmers in the low latitudes and tropical regions the timing and length of the growing seasons when farmers plant their crops are going to be changing dramatically per the usda due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions78 another way of thinking about food security and climate change comes from evan fraser a geographer working at the university of guelph in ontario canada his approach is to explore the vulnerability of food systems to climate change and he defines vulnerability to climate change as situations that occur when relatively minor environmental problems cause major effects on food security examples of this include the irish potato famine79dubious discuss which was caused by a rainy year that created ideal conditions for the fungal blight to spread in potato fields or the ethiopian famine in the early 1980s.80 three factors stand out as common in such cases and these three factors act as a diagnostic tool kit through which to identify cases where food security may be vulnerable to climate change these factors are 1 specialized agro-ecosystems 2 households with very few livelihood options other than farming 3 situations where formal institutions do not provide adequate safety nets to protect people80 the international food policy research institute ifpri estimates that an additional us 7.1-7.3 billion per year are needed in agricultural investments to offset the negative effect of climate change on nutrition for children by 2050 table 6.81 agricultural diseasesedit stripe rust on a wheat stem diseases affecting livestock or crops can have devastating effects on food availability especially if there are no contingency plans in place for example ug99 a lineage of wheat stem rust which can cause up to 100 crop losses is present in wheat fields in several countries in africa and the middle east and is predicted to spread rapidly through these regions and possibly further afield potentially causing a wheat production disaster that would affect food security worldwide8283 the genetic diversity of the crop wild relatives of wheat can be used to improve modern varieties to be more resistant to rust in their centers of origin wild wheat plants are screened for resistance to rust then their genetic information is studied and finally wild plants and modern varieties are crossed through means of modern plant breeding in order to transfer the resistance genes from the wild plants to the modern varieties8485 dictatorship and kleptocracyedit see also political corruption nobel prize winning economist amartya sen has observed that there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem while drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger famine conditions it is government action or inaction that determines its severity and often even whether or not a famine will occur the 20th century is full of examples of governmentswhich undermining the food security of their own nations sometimes intentionallycitation needed when governments come to power by force or rigged elections and not by way of fair and open elections their base of support is often narrow and built upon cronyism and patronage under such conditions the distribution of food within a country is a political issue governments in most countries give priority to urban areas since that is where the most influential and powerful families and enterprises are usually located the government often neglects subsistence farmers and rural areas in general the more remote and underdeveloped the area the less likely the government will be to effectively meet its needs many agrarian policies especially the pricing of agricultural commodities discriminate against rural areas governments often keep prices of basic grains at such artificially low levels that subsistence producers cannot accumulate enough capital to make investments to improve their production thus they are effectively prevented from getting out of their precarious situation86 further dictators and warlordswho have used food as a political weapon rewarding their supporters while denying food supplies to areas that oppose their rule under such conditions food becomes a currency with which to buy support and famine becomes an effective weapon to be used against the oppositionoriginal research governmentswhich with strong tendencies towards kleptocracy can undermine food security even when harvests are good when government monopolizes trade farmers may find that they are free to grow cash crops for export but under penalty of law only able to sell their crops to government buyers at prices far below the world market priceoriginal research the government then is free to sell their crop on the world market at full price pocketing the difference this creates an artificial poverty trap from which even the most hard working and motivated farmers may not escapeoriginal research when the rule of law is absent or private property is non-existent farmers have little incentive to improve their productivityaccording to whom if a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land farmers may be content with the perceived safety of mediocritycitation needed as pointed out by william bernstein in his book the birth of plenty individuals without property are susceptible to starvation and it is much easier to bend the fearful and hungry to the will of the state if a farmers property can be arbitrarily threatened by the state that power will inevitably be employed to intimidate those with divergent political and religious opinions food sovereigntyedit the approach known as food sovereignty views the business practices of multinational corporations as a form of neocolonialism it contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations particularly in the tropics they also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands64 under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations likewise food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right with several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries technologies that include improved seeds chemical fertilizers and pesticides crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agencycitation needed risks to food securityedit further information 20072008 world food price crisis and food prices population growthedit further information world population current un projections show a continued increase in population in the near future but a steady decline in the population growth rate with the global population expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050 un population division estimates for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion mathematical modeling supports the lower estimate some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth highlighting the growing pressures on the environment global food supplies and energy resources solutions for feeding the nine billion in the future are being studied and documented87 one out of every seven people on our planet go to sleep hungry people are suffering due to overpopulation 25,000 people die of malnutrition and hunger related diseases everyday fossil fuel dependenceedit further information agriculture and petroleum and peak oils effects on agriculture while agricultural output increased as a result of the green revolution the energy input into the process that is the energy that must be expended to produce a crop has also increased at a greater rate so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time green revolution techniques also heavily rely on chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides some of which must be developed from fossil fuels making agriculture increasingly reliant on petroleum products between 1950 and 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe world grain production increased by 250 the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers natural gas pesticides oil and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation88 david pimentel professor of ecology and agriculture at cornell university and mario giampietro senior researcher at the national research institute on food and nutrition inran place in their study food land population and the us economy the maximum us population for a sustainable economy at 200 million to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the united states must reduce its population by at least one-third and world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds says the studycitation needed the authors of this study believe that the mentioned agricultural crisis will only begin to affect us after 2020 and will not become critical until 2050 the oncoming peaking of global oil production and subsequent decline of production along with the peak of north american natural gas production will very likely precipitate this agricultural crisis much sooner than expected36 geologist dale allen pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before89 homogeneity in the global food supplyedit a small number of major crops eg soybean have formed an increasing share of the food energy protein fat and food weight eaten by the worlds population over the past 50 years90 since 1961 human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops and thus have become more homogeneous globally90 the differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68 between 1961 and 2009 the modern global standard90 diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy calories protein fat and food weight that they provide to the worlds human population including wheat rice sugar maize soybean by 28491 palm oil by 17391 and sunflower by 24691 whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important crops wheat has become a staple in over 97 of countries with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide other crops have declined sharply over the same period including rye yam sweet potato by -4591 cassava by -3891 coconut sorghum by -5291 and millets by -4591909192 such crop diversity change in the human diet is associated with mixed effects on food security improving under-nutrition in some regions but contributing to the diet-related diseases caused by over-consumption of macronutrients90 price settingedit on april 30 2008 thailand one of the worlds biggest rice exporters announces the project of the creation of the organisation of rice exporting countries with the potential to develop into a price-fixing cartel for rice it is a project to organize 21 rice exporting countries to create a homonymous organisation to control the price of rice the group is mainly made up of thailand vietnam cambodia laos and myanmar the organization attempts to serve the purpose of making a contribution to ensuring food stability not just in an individual country but also to address food shortages in the region and the world however it is still questionable whether this organization will serve its role as an effective rice price fixing cartel that is similar to opecs mechanism for managing petroleum economic analysts and traders said the proposal would go nowhere because of the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control farmers output moreover countries that are involved expressed their concern that this could only worsen the food security93949596 land use changeedit china needs not less than 120 million hectares of arable land for its food security china has recently reported a surplus of 15 million hectares on the other side of the coin some 4 million hectares of conversion to urban use and 3 million hectares of contaminated land have been reported as well97 furthermore a survey found that 2.5 of chinas arable land is too contaminated to grow food without harm98 in europe the conversion of agricultural soil implied a net loss of potential but the rapid loss in the area of arable soils appears to be economically meaningless because eu is perceived to be dependent on internal food supply anymore during the period 2000-2006 the european union lost 0.27 of its cropland and 0.26 of its crop productive potential the loss of agricultural land during the same time was the highest in the netherlands which lost 1.57 of its crop production potential within six years the figures are quite alarming for cyprus 0.84 ireland 0.77 and spain 0.49 as well99 in italy in the emilia-romagna plain erp the conversion of 15,000 ha of agricultural soil period 2003-2008 implied a net loss of 109,000 mg per year of wheat which accounts for the calories needed by 14 of erp population 425,000 people such a loss in wheat production is just 0.02 of gross domestic product gdp of the emilia-romagna region which is actually a minor effect in financial terms additionally the income from the new land use is often much higher than the one guaranteed by agriculture as in the case of urbanisation or extraction of raw materials100 global catastrophic risksedit further information global catastrophic risk as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions reduce the stability of the global climate101 abrupt climate change could become more intense102 the impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally103 causing impact winter particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out but particles in the stratosphere especially sulfate could remain there for years103 similarly a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis causing volcanic winter the toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans103 see toba catastrophe theory again primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years104 the high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict105 children and food securityedit bengali famine 1943 the japanese conquest of burma cut off indias main supply of rice imports106 on april 29 2008 a unicef uk report found that the worlds poorest and most vulnerable children are being hit the hardest by climate change the report our climate our children our responsibility the implications of climate change for the worlds children says that access to clean water and food supplies will become more difficult particularly in africa and asia107 by way of comparison in one of the largest food producing countries in the world the united states approximately one out of six people are food insecure including 17 million children according to the us department of agriculture108 a 2012 study in the journal of applied research on children found that rates of food security varied significantly by race class and education in both kindergarten and third grade 8 of the children were classified as food insecure but only 5 of white children were food insecure while 12 and 15 of black and hispanic children were food insecure respectively in third grade 13 of black and 11 of hispanic children are food insecure compared to 5 of white children109110 gender and food securityedit main article gender and food security a kenyan woman farmer at work in the mount kenya region gender inequality both leads to and is a result of food insecurity according to estimates women and girls make up 60 of the worlds chronically hungry and little progress has been made in ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women111112 women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household where their bargaining power is lower on the other hand gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger113 women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their childrens needs114 women also play an important role in food production processing distribution and marketing they often work as unpaid family workers are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43 of the agricultural labor force in developing countries varying from 20 in latin america to 50 in eastern and southeastern asia and sub-saharan africa however women face discrimination in access to land credit technologies finance and other services empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men women could boost their yields by 2030 raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4 while those are rough estimates the significant benefit of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied115 the gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security availability access utilization and stability as defined by the food and agriculture organization116 the number of people affected by hunger is extremely high with enormous effects on women and girls117 making this trend disappear must be a top priority for governments and international institutions117 actions governments take must take into consideration that food insecurity is an issue regarding equality rights and social justice117 food and nutrition insecurity is a political and economic phenomenon fuelled by inequitable global and national processes117 factors like capitalism exploration of indigenous lands all contribute to food insecurity for minorities and the people who are the most oppressed in various countries women being one of these oppressed groups to emphasis food and nutrition insecurity is a gender justice issue117 the facts that women and girls are the most oppressed by the inequitable global economic processes that govern food systems and by global trends such as climate change shows how institutions continue to place women in positions of disadvantage and impoverishment to make money and thrive on capitalizing the food system117 when the government withholds food by raising its prices to amounts only privileged people can afford they both benefit and are able to control the lower-class marginalized people via the food market an interesting fact is that despite rapid economic growth in india thousands of women and girls still lack food and nutrition security as a direct result of their lower status compared with men and boys117 such inequalities are compounded by women and girls often limited access to productive resources education and decision-making by the normalised burden of unpaid work including care work and by the endemic problems of gender-based violence gbv hiv and aids117 use of genetically modified gm cropsedit one of the most up-and-coming techniques to ensuring global food security is the use of genetically modified gm crops the genome of these crops can be altered to address one or more aspects of the plant that may be preventing it from being grown in various regions under certain conditions many of these alterations can address the challenges that were previously mentioned above including the water crisis land degradation and the ever-changing climate in agriculture and animal husbandry the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield by creating high-yielding varieties often the handful of hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the rest of the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases the area sown to genetically engineered crops in developing countries is rapidly catching up with the area sown in industrial nations according to the international service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications isaaa gm crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005 up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004 however the isaaa is funded by organisations including prominent agricultural biotechnology corporations such as monsanto and bayercitation needed and there have been several challenges made to the accuracy of isaaas global figurescitation needed opposition to gm cropsedit respected scientists question the safety of biotechnology as a panacea agroecologists miguel altieri and peter rosset have enumerated ten reasons118 why biotechnology will not ensure food security protect the environment or reduce poverty reasons include there is no relationship between the prevalence of hunger in a given country and its population most innovations in agricultural biotechnology have been profit-driven rather than need-driven ecological theory predicts that the large-scale landscape homogenization with transgenic crops will exacerbate the ecological problems already associated with monoculture agriculture and that much of the needed food can be produced by small farmers located throughout the world using existing agroecological technologies based on evidence from previous attempts there is a likely lack of transferability of one type of gm crop from one region to another for example modified crops that have proven successful in asia from the green revolution have failed when tried in regions of africa119 more research must be done regarding the specific requirements of growing a specific crop in a specific region there is also a drastic lack of education given to governments farmers and the community about the science behind gm crops as well as suitable growing practices in most relief programs farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little attention is paid to the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing gm crops and are then left to make judgments on their own because they have so little information regarding these crops they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their unnatural origins this has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices120 a study published in june 2016 evaluated the status of the implementation of golden rice which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of vitamin a than its non-gmo counterparts this strain of rice was designed so that malnourished women and children in third world countries who were more susceptible to deficiencies could easily improve their vitamin a intake levels and prevent blindness which is a common result golden rice production was centralized to the philippines yet there have been many hurdles to jump in order to get production moving the study showed that the project is far behind schedule and is not living up to its expectations although research on golden rice still continues the country has moved forward with other non-gmo initiatives to address the vitamin a deficiency problem which is so prevasive in that region121122 many anti-gmo activists argue that the use of gm crops decreases biodiversity amongst plants livestock biodiversity is also threatened by the modernization of agriculture and the focus on more productive major breeds therefore efforts have been made by governments and non-governmental organizations to conserve livestock biodiversity through strategies such as cryoconservation of animal genetic resources123124 support of gm cropsedit many gm crop success stories exist primarily in developed nations like the usa china and various countries in europe common gm crops include cotton maize and soybeans all of which are grown throughout north and south america as well as regions of asia125 modified cotton crops for example have been altered such that they are resistant to pests can grown in more extreme heat cold or drought and produce longer stronger fibers to be used in textile production126 one of the biggest threats to rice which is a staple food crop especially in india and other countries within asia is blast disease which is a fungal infection that causes lesions to form on all parts of the plant127 a genetically engineered strain of rice has been developed so that it is resistant to blast greatly improving the crop yield of farmers and allowing rice to be more accessible to everyone128 some other crops have been modified such that they produce higher yields per plant or that they require less land for growing the latter can be helpful in extreme climates with little arable land and also decreases deforestation as fewer trees need to be cut down in order to make room for crop fields129 others yet have been altered such that they do not require the use of insecticides or fungicides this addresses various health concerns associated with such pesticides and can also work to improve biodiversity within the area in which these crops are grown130 in a review of borlaugs 2000 publication entitled ending world hunger the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry131 the authors argued that borlaugs warnings were still true in 2010,132 gm crops are as natural and safe as todays bread wheat opined dr borlaug who also reminded agricultural scientists of their moral obligation to stand up to the antiscience crowd and warn policy makers that global food insecurity will not disappear without this new technology and ignoring this reality global food insecurity would make future solutions all the more difficult to achieve rozwadowski and kagale research conducted by the gmo risk assessment and communication of evidence grace program through the eu between 2007 and 2013 focused on many uses of gm crops and evaluated many facets of their effects on human animal and environmental health approachesedit a liquid manure spreader equipment that is used to increase agricultural productivity by the united nationsedit the un millennium development goals are one of the initiatives aimed at achieving food security in the world the first millennium development goal states that the un is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty by 2015.133 olivier de schutter the un special rapporteur on the right to food advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges this approach emphasizes the physical availability of food the socialeconomic and physical access people have to food and the nutrition safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food134 by the food and agriculture organizationedit the food and agriculture organization of the united nations stated in the state of food insecurity in the world 2003 that countries that have reduced hunger often had rapid economic growth specifically in their agricultural sectors these countries were also characterized as having slower population growth lower hiv rates and higher rankings in the human development index135 at that time the fao considered addressing agriculture and population growth vital to achieving food security in the state of food insecurity in the world 2012 the fao restated its focus on economic growth and agricultural growth to achieve food security and added a focus on the poor and on nutrition-sensitive growth for example economic growth should be used by governments to provide public services to benefit poor and hungry populations the fao also cited smallholders including women as groups that should be involved in agricultural growth to generate employment for the poor for economic and agricultural growth to be nutrition-sensitive resources should be utilized to improve access to diverse diets for the poor as well as access to a safe water supply and to healthcare23 the fao has proposed a twin track approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure5 in general the fao proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor to obtain short-term food security vouchers for seeds fertilizer or access to services could promote agricultural production the use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers was another approach the fao noted conditional transfers could include school feeding programs while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution emergency food aid or cash transfers a third approach is the use of subsidies as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households the fao stated that approaches should be human rights-based target the poor promote gender equality enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty23 the fao noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the millennium development goal hunger target the fao credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security irrigation systems were established through infrastructure development programs two programs harvestplus and the golden rice project provided biofortified crops in order to decrease micronutrient deficiencess8 world food day was established on october 16 in honor of the date that the fao was founded in 1945 on this day the fao hosts a variety of event at the headquarters in rome and around the world as well as seminars with un officials27 by the world food programmeedit fight hunger walk the world campaign is a united nations world food programme initiative the world food programme wfp is an agency of the united nations that uses food aid to promote food security and eradicate hunger and poverty in particular the wfp provides food aid to refugees and to others experiencing food emergencies it also seeks to improve nutrition and quality of life to the most vulnerable populations and promote self-reliance136 an example of a wfp program is the food for assets program in which participants work on new infrastructure or learn new skills that will increase food security in exchange for food137 the wfp and the government of kenya have partnered in the food for assets program in hopes of increasing the resilience of communities to shocks138 global partnerships to achieve food security and end hungeredit in april 2012 the food assistance convention was signed the worlds first legally binding international agreement on food aid the may 2012 copenhagen consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending they put this ahead of other priorities like the fight against malaria and aids139 the main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved sustainable development goals in particular goal 2 zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.140 a number of organizations have formed initiatives with the more ambitious goal to achieve this outcome in only 10 years by 2025 in 2013 caritas international started a caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025 the one human family food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising improving the effect of caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food141 the partnership compact2025 led by ifpri with the involvement of un organisations ngos and private foundations142 develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years by 2025.143 it bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by shenggen fan and paul polman that analyzed the experiences from china vietnam brazil and thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and undernutrition was possible by 2025.144 in june 2015 the european union and the bill melinda gates foundation have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children the program will initiatilly be implemented in bangladesh burundi ethiopia kenya laos and niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies145 the food and agriculture organization of the un has created a partnership that will act through the african unions caadp framework aiming to end hunger in africa by 2025 it includes different interventions including support for improved food production a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation146 by the united states agency for international developmentedit the united states agency for international development usaid proposes several key steps to increasing agricultural productivity which is in turn key to increasing rural income and reducing food insecurity147 they include boosting agricultural science and technology current agricultural yields are insufficient to feed the growing populations eventually the rising agricultural productivity drives economic growth securing property rights and access to finance enhancing human capital through education and improved health conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms and democracy and governance based on principles of accountability and transparency in public institutions and the rule of law are basic to reducing vulnerable members of society since the 1960s the us has been implementing a food stamp program now called the supplemental nutrition assistance program to directly target consumers who lack the income to purchase food according to tim josling a senior fellow at the freeman spogli institute for international studies stanford university food stamps or other methods of distribution of purchasing power directly to consumers might fit into the range of international programs under consideration to tackle food insecurity148 improving agricultural productivity to benefit the rural pooredit a farmer on the outskirts of lilongwe malawi prepares a field for planting there are strong direct relationships between agricultural productivity hunger poverty and sustainability three-quarters of the worlds poor live in rural areas and make their living from agriculture hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas moreover the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets the higher the incidence of malnutrition therefore improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years as the global population approaches nine billion growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on rainfed agriculture improving soil fertility management expanding cropped areas investing in irrigation conducting agricultural trade between countries and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses according to the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture a major study led by the international water management institute iwmi managing rainwater and soil moisture more effectively and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people it has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff149 increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food which translates into better diets and under market conditions that offer a level playing field into higher farm incomes with more money farmers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole133 researchers suggest forming an alliance between the emergency food program and community-supported agriculture as some countries food stamps cannot be used at farmers markets and places where food is less processed and grown locally150 the gathering of wild food plants appears to be an efficient alternative method of subsistence in tropical countries which may play a role in poverty alleviation151 producing food without agricultureedit david denkenberger and joshua pearce have proposed in feeding everyone no matter what a variety of alternate foods which convert fossil fuels or biomass into food without sunlight to address sunlight-blocking food security scenarios152 the solution using fossil fuel energy source is natural gas digesting bacteria153 one example of a biomass alternate food is that mushrooms can grow directly on wood without sunlight154 another example is that cellulosic biofuel production typically already creates sugar as an intermediate product155 large-scale food stockpilingedit the minimum annual global wheat storage is approximately 2 months156 to counteract the severe food security issues caused by global catastrophic risks years of food storage has been proposed157 though this could ameliorate smaller scale problems like regional conflict and drought it would exacerbate current food insecurity by raising food prices agricultural insurancesedit insurance is a financial instrument which allows exposed individuals to pool resources to spread their risk they do so by contributing premium to an insurance fund which will indemnify those who suffer insured loss this procedure reduces the risk for an individual by spreading hisher risk among the multiple fund contributors insurance can be designed to protect many types of individuals and assets against single or multiple perils and buffer insured parties against sudden and dramatic income or asset loss crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters two type of insurances are available158 1 claim-based insurances and 2 index-based insurances in particular in poor countries facing food security problems index-based insurances offer some interesting advantages 1 indices can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured 2 these indices can be delivered at low cost and 3 the insurance products open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurancesrelevant discuss an advantage of index-based insurance is that it can potentially be delivered at lower cost a significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders negotiating and administering contracts verifying losses and determining payouts index insurance eliminates the loss verification step thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost a second advantage of index-based insurance is that because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses it eliminates much of the fraud moral hazard and adverse selection which are common in classical claim-based insurance a further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment the indemnity payment could be automated further reducing transaction costsrelevant discuss basis risk is a major disadvantage of index-based insurance it is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa basis risk is a direct result of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual the weaker this relation the higher the basis risk it is obvious that high basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance it thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis riskrelevant discuss food security quality through bees bees and other pollinating insects are currently improving the food production of 2 billion small farmers worldwide helping to ensure food security for the worlds population research shows that if pollination is managed well on small diverse farms with all other factors being equal crop yields can increase by a significant median of 24 percent159 criticismedit as of 2015update the concept of food security has mostly focused on food calories rather than the quality and nutrition of food the concept of nutrition security evolved over time in 1995 it has been defined as adequate nutritional status in terms of protein energy vitamins and minerals for all household members at all times16016 how animal pollinators positively affect fruit
