of an oily fleshy outer layer the pericarp with a single seed the palm kernel also rich in oil speciesedit the two species e guineensis and e oleifera can produce fertile hybrids the genome of e guineensis has been sequenced which has important implications for breeding improved strains of the crop plants4 commercial palm oil cultivationedit main article palm oil since palm oil contains more saturated fats than oils made from canola corn linseed soybeans safflower and sunflowers it can withstand extreme deep-frying heat and resists oxidation5 it contains no trans fat and its use in food has increased as food-labelling laws have changed to specify trans fat content oil from elaeis guineensis is also used as biofuel human use of oil palms may date back about 5,000 years in coastal west africa palm oil was also discovered in the late 19th century by archaeologists in a tomb at abydos dating back to 3000 bce6 it is thought that arab traders brought the oil palm to egypt7 elaeis guineensis is now extensively cultivated in tropical countries outside africa particularly malaysia and indonesia which together produce most of the world supply palm oil plantations are under increasing scrutiny for social and environmental harm particularly because rainforests with high biodiversity are destroyed greenhouse gas output is increased and because people are displaced by unscrupulous palm-oil enterprises especially in indonesia there is also growing pressure for palm oil producers to prove that they are not harming rare animals in the cultivation process8 see alsoedit
