of several food crops including teosinte an ancestor of maize3 most historians believe maize was domesticated in the tehuacan valley of mexico4 recent research modified this view somewhat scholars now indicate the adjacent balsas river valley of south-central mexico as the center of domestication5 the olmec and mayans cultivated maize in numerous varieties throughout mesoamerica cooked ground or processed through nixtamalization beginning about 2500 bc the crop spread through much of the americas6 the region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops nevertheless recent data indicates that the spread of maize took place even earlier according to piperno a large corpus of data indicates that it maize was dispersed into lower central america by 7600 bp 5600 bc and had moved into the inter-andean valleys of colombia between 7000 and 6000 bp 5000-4000 bc5 since then even earlier dates have been published7 after european contact with the americas in the late 15th and early 16th centuries explorers and traders carried maize back to europe and introduced it to other countries maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels while field corn varieties are used for animal feed various corn-based human food uses including grinding into cornmeal or masa pressing into corn oil and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey and as chemical feedstocks an influential 2002 study by matsuoka et al has demonstrated that rather than the multiple independent domestications model all maize arose from a single domestication in southern mexico about 9,000 years ago the study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the mexican highlands later maize spread from this region over the americas along two major paths this is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of mexico before spreading to the lowlands89 before they were domesticated maize plants only grew small 25 millimetres 1in long corn cobs and only one per plant many centuries of artificial selection by the indigenous people of the americas resulted in the development of maize plants capable of growing several cobs per plant that were usually several centimetresinches long each10 maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the americas11 with 332 million metric tons grown annually in the united states alone approximately 40 of the crop130 million tonsis used for corn ethanol12 genetically modified maize made up 85 of the maize planted in the united states in 2009.13 names many small male flowers make up the male inflorescence called the tassel the word maize derives from the spanish form of the indigenous tano word for the plant mahiz14 it is known by other names around the world the word corn outside north america australia and new zealand refers to any cereal crop its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local staple1516 in the united states15 canada17 australia and new zealandcitation needed corn primarily means maize this usage started as a shortening of indian corn15 indian corn primarily means maize the staple grain of indigenous americans but can refer more specifically to multicolored flint corn used for decoration18 in places outside north america australia and new zealand corn often refers to maize in culinary contexts the narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word as in sweet corn sweetcorn corn on the cob baby corn the puffed confection known as popcorn and the breakfast cereal known as corn flakes in southern africa maize is commonly called mielie afrikaans or mealie english19 words derived from the portuguese word for maize milho20 maize is preferred in formal scientific and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain unlike corn which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region16 maize is used by agricultural bodies and research institutes such as the fao and csiro national agricultural and industry associations often include the word maize in their name even in english-speaking countries where the local informal word is something other than maize for example the maize association of australia the indian maize development association the kenya maize consortium and maize breeders network the national maize association of nigeria the zimbabwe seed maize association however in commodities trading corn consistently refers to maize and not other grainscitation needed structure and physiology the maize plant is often 3m 10ft in height21 though some natural strains can grow 12m 39ft.22 the stem is commonly composed of 20 internodes 23 of 18cm 7.1in length21 a leaf which grows from each node is generally 9cm 4in in width and 120cm 4ft in length ears develop above a few of the leaves in the midsection of the plant between the stem and leaf sheath elongating by 3mmday to a length of 18cm 7in 21 with 60cm 24in being the maximum alleged in the subspecies24 they are female inflorescences tightly enveloped by several layers of ear leaves commonly called husks certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears these are the source of the baby corn used as a vegetable in asian cuisine the apex of the stem ends in the tassel an inflorescence of male flowers when the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry anthers on the tassel dehisce and release pollen maize pollen is anemophilous dispersed by wind and because of its large settling velocity most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel elongated stigmas called silks emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear they are often pale yellow and 18cm 7in in length like tufts of hair in appearance at the end of each is a carpel which may develop into a kernel if fertilized by a pollen grain the pericarp of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as caryopsis typical of the grasses and the entire kernel is often referred to as the seed the cob is close to a multiple fruit in structure except that the individual fruits the kernels never fuse into a single mass the grains are about the size of peas and adhere in regular rows around a white pithy substance which forms the ear the maximum size of kernels is reputedly 2.5cm 1in.25 an ear commonly holds 600 kernels they are of various colors blackish bluish-gray purple green red white and yellow when ground into flour maize yields more flour with much less bran than wheat does it lacks the protein gluten of wheat and therefore makes baked goods with poor rising capability a genetic variant that accumulates more sugar and less starch in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called sweet corn young ears can be consumed raw with the cob and silk but as the plant matures usually during the summer months the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility by the end of the growing season the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water female inflorescence with young silk mature silk stalks ears and silk male flowers full-grown maize plants mature maize ear on a stalk planting density affects multiple aspects of maize modern farming techniques in developed countries usually rely on dense planting which produces one ear per stalk26 stands of silage maize are yet denser27 and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter maize is a facultative short-day plant 28 and flowers in a certain number of growing degree days 10c 50f in the environment to which it is adapted29 the magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize flowers is genetically prescribed30 and regulated by the phytochrome system31 photoperiodicity can be eccentric in tropical cultivars such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost these attributes however may prove useful in using tropical maize for biofuels32 immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one dimboa dimboa is a member of a group of hydroxamic acids also known as benzoxazinoids that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests including insects pathogenic fungi and bacteria dimboa is also found in related grasses particularly wheat a maize mutant bx lacking dimboa is highly susceptible to attack by aphids and fungi dimboa is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the european corn borer family crambidae as maize matures dimboa levels and resistance to the corn borer decline because of its shallow roots maize is susceptible to droughts intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils and prone to be uprooted by severe winds33 maize kernels maize plant diagram ear of maize with irregular rows of

lutein and zeaxanthin in red-colored maizes the kernel coloration is due to anthocyanins and phlobaphenes these latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway34 from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols35 by the expression of maize pericarp color1 p1 gene36 which encodes an r2r3 myb-like transcriptional activator37 of the a1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols38 while another gene suppressor of pericarp pigmentation 1 or spp1 acts as a suppressor39 the p1 gene encodes an myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments while the p1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs and unstable factor for orange1 ufo1 modifies p1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp as well as vegetative tissues which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments36 the maize p gene encodes a myb homolog that recognizes the sequence cctaacc in sharp contrast with the ctaacgg bound by vertebrate myb proteins40 abnormal flowers sometimes in maize inflorescences are found containing both male and female flowers or hermaphrodite flowers41 genetics exotic varieties of maize are collected to add genetic diversity when selectively breeding new domestic strains many forms of maize are used for food

traits for a robust initial classification then genetic cytological protein and dna evidence was added now the categories are forms little used races racial complexes and recently branches maize is a diploid with 20 chromosomes n10 the combined length of the chromosomes is 1500 cm some of the maize chromosomes have what are known as chromosomal knobs highly repetitive heterochromatic domains that stain darkly individual knobs are polymorphic among strains of both maize and teosinte barbara mcclintock used these knob markers to validate her transposon theory of jumping genes for which she won the 1983 nobel prize in physiology or medicine maize is still an important model organism for genetics and developmental biology today42 the maize genetics cooperation stock center funded by the usda agricultural research service and located in the department of crop sciences at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign is a stock center of maize mutants the total collection has nearly 80,000 samples the bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants there are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations eg translocations and inversions and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers eg tetraploids genetic data describing the maize mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about maize genetics can be accessed at maizegdb the maize genetics and genomics database43 in 2005 the us national science foundation nsf department of agriculture usda and the department of energy doe formed a consortium to sequence the b73 maize genome the resulting dna sequence data was deposited immediately into genbank a public repository for genome-sequence data sequences and genome annotations have also been made available throughout the projects lifetime at the projects official site44 primary sequencing of the maize genome was completed in 2008.45 on november 20 2009 the consortium published results of its sequencing effort in science46 the genome 85 of which is composed of transposons was found to contain 32,540 genes by comparison the human genome contains about 2.9 billion bases and 26,000 genes much of the maize genome has been duplicated and reshuffled by helitronsgroup of rolling circle transposons47 according to a genetic study by embrapa corn cultivation was introduced in south america from mexico in two great waves the first 5000 years ago spread through the andes the second about 2000 years ago through the lowlands of south america48 breeding field of maize in liechtenstein maize reproduces sexually each year this randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation meaning that desirable traits found in the crop like high yield or good nutrition can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers james l reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing reids yellow dent in the 1860s these early efforts were based on mass selection later breeding efforts included ear to row selection c g hopkins ca 1896 hybrids made from selected inbred lines g h shull 1909 and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 inbred lines d f jones ca 1918 1922 university supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids ref jugenheimer hybrid maize breeding and seed production pub 1958 by the 1930s companies such as pioneer devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development internationally important seed banks such as international maize and wheat improvement center cimmyt and the us bank at maize genetics cooperation stock center university of illinois at urbana-champaign maintain germplasm important for future crop development since the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits such as yield nutrition drought pest and disease tolerance both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland pesticides water and fertilizer49 global maize program panorama of cornfields in nan province thailand cimmyt operates a conventional breeding program to provide optimized strains the program began in the 1980s hybrid seeds are distributed in africa by

genetically modified corn which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption and was subsequently withdrawn from the market54 origin see also origin of maize and interaction with teosintes a tripsacum grass big and a teosinte small maize is the domesticated variant of teosinte55 the two plants have dissimilar appearance maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short bushy plant the difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes55 several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in mesoamerica5657 it is a direct domestication of a mexican annual teosinte zea mays ssp parviglumis native to the balsas river valley in south-eastern mexico with up to 12 of its genetic material obtained from zea mays ssp mexicana through introgression this theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of matsuoka et al8 it has been derived from hybridization between a small domesticated maize a slightly changed form of a wild maize and a teosinte of section luxuriantes either z luxurians or z diploperennis it has undergone two or more domestications either of a wild maize or of a teosinte the term teosinte describes all species and subspecies in the genus zea excluding zea mays ssp mays it has evolved from a hybridization of z diploperennis by tripsacum dactyloides in the late 1930s paul mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of tripsacum a related genus this theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern genetic testing which refutes mangelsdorfs model and the fourth listed above5640 the teosinte origin theory was proposed by the russian botanist nikolai ivanovich vavilov in 1931 and the later american nobel prize-winner george beadle in 1932.5610 it is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants genomes teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring a number of questions remain concerning the species among them how the immense diversity of the species of sect zea originated how the tiny archaeological specimens of 35002700 bc could have been selected from a teosinte and how domestication could have proceeded without leaving remains of teosinte or maize with teosintoid traits earlier than the earliest known until recently dating from ca 1100 bc the domestication of maize is of particular interest to researchersarchaeologists geneticists ethnobotanists geographers etc the process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of oaxaca and jalisco because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there connection with parviglumis subspecies teosinte top maize-teosinte hybrid middle maize bottom genetic studies led by john doebley identified zea mays ssp parviglumis native to the balsas river valley in mexicos southwestern highlands and also known as balsas teosinte as being the crop wild relative teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize58 this has been confirmed by further more recent studies which refined this hypothesis somewhat archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the balsas river valley as the more likely location of early domestication this river is not very long so these locations are not very distant stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from iguala guerrero596061 also doebley was part of the team that is credited with first finding back in 2002 that maize had been domesticated only once about 9000 years ago and then spread throughout the americas862 a primitive corn was being grown in southern mexico central america and northern south america 7,000 years ago archaeological remains of early maize ears found at guila naquitz cave in the oaxaca valley date back roughly 6,250 years the oldest ears from caves near tehuacan puebla date ca 3,450 bc6 maize pollen dated to 7300 cal bp from san andres tabasco on the caribbean coast has also been recovered60 as maize was introduced to new cultures new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations maize was the staple food or a major staple along with squash andean region potato quinoa beans and amaranth of most pre-columbian north american mesoamerican south american and caribbean cultures the mesoamerican civilization in particular was deeply interrelated with maize its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation from the planting to the food preparation maize formed the mesoamerican peoples identity centeotl the aztec deity of maize it is unknown what precipitated its domestication because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell it is possible that early on teosinte may have been gathered as preferred feed for domestic animals also back in 1939 george beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily popped for human consumption like modern popcorn63 some have argued it would have taken too many generations of selective breeding to produce large compressed ears for efficient cultivation however studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded spreading to the north around 2500 bc maize began to spread to the north it was first cultivated in what is now the united states at several sites in new mexico and arizona about 2100 bc64 during the first millennium ad maize cultivation spread more widely in the areas north in particular the large-scale adoption of maize agriculture and consumption in eastern north america took place about ad 900 native americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop65 in 2005 research by the usda forest service suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern united states corresponded with a decline of freshwater mussels which are very sensitive to environmental changes66 production methods seedlings three weeks after sowing young stalks because it is cold-intolerant in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring its root system is generally shallow so the plant is dependent on soil moisture as a c4 plant a plant that uses c4 carbon fixation maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than c3 plants plants that use c3 carbon fixation like the small grains alfalfa and soybeans maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence when the flowers are ready for pollination in the united states a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize were knee-high by the fourth of july although modern hybrids generally exceed this growth rate maize used for silage is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature sweet corn is harvested in the milk stage after pollination but before starch has formed between late summer and early to mid-autumn field maize is left in the field very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain and may in fact sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring the importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of africa where periodic drought regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent famine although it is grown mainly in wet hot climates it has been said to thrive in cold hot dry or wet conditions meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop67 mature plants showing ears maize was planted by the native americans in hills in a complex system known to some as the three sisters maize provided support for beans and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other legumes and squashes provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil68 this method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill 60120cm 2.03.9ft apart was planted with three or four seeds a method still used by home gardeners a later technique was checked maize where hills were placed 40in 1.0m apart in each direction allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions in more arid lands this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of 1012cm 3.94.7in deep furrows to collect water modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some native american reservations when maize is planted in rows it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space69 in north america fields are often planted in a two-crop rotation with a nitrogen-fixing crop often alfalfa in cooler climates and soybeans in regions with longer summers sometimes a third crop winter wheat is added to the rotation many of the maize varieties grown in the united states and canada are hybrids often the varieties have been genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate or to provide protection against natural pests glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance this genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature in midwestern united states low-till or no-till farming techniques are usually used in low-till fields are covered once maybe twice with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest the fields are planted and fertilized weeds are controlled through the use of herbicides and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season this technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil and thus provides more moisture for the crop the technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients making them undesirable mature field maize ears before world war ii most maize in north america was harvested by hand this involves a large numbers of workers and associated social events husking or shucking bees some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use but the maize combine was not adopted until after the war by hand or mechanical picker the entire ear is harvested which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use few modern farms store maize in this manner most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins the combine with a corn head with points and snap rolls instead of a reel does not cut the stalk it simply pulls the stalk down the stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground the ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery the combine separates out the husk and the cob keeping only the kernels for storing grain in bins the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling if the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high grain dryers are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain this can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases propane or natural gas and electricity to power the blowers70 quantity worldwide maize production harvesting maize

support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades this suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle lodging resistance tolerance of high plant density diseasepest tolerance and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant73 top ten maize producers in 201374 country production tonnes united

starch from maize can also be made into plastics fabrics adhesives and many other chemical products the corn steep liquor a plentiful watery byproduct of maize wet milling process is widely used in the biochemical industry and research as a culture medium to grow many kinds of microorganisms83 chrysanthemin is found in purple corn and is used as a food coloring bio-fuel see also corn ethanol and corn stover feed maize is being used increasingly for heatingcitation needed specialized corn stoves similar to wood stoves are available and use either feed maize or wood pellets to generate heat maize cobs are also used as a biomass fuel source maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel they feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels or wood pellets or cherry pits into the fire maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of ethanol fuelcitation needed ethanol is mixed with gasoline to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles high fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize this led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers because of the relationship between fuel and maize prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oilcitation needed the price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production the cost of transportation production and marketing are a large portion 80 of the price of food in the united states higher energy costs affect these costs especially transportation the increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost the effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand and therefore price of maize this in turn results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production this reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices8485 farm-based maize silage digester located near neumnster in germany 2007 green inflatable biogas holder is shown on top of the digester maize is widely used in germany as a feedstock for biogas plants here the maize is harvested shredded then placed in silage clamps from which it is fed into the biogas plants this process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as in the production of fuel ethanol a biomass gasification power plant in strem near gssing burgenland austria began in 2005 research is being done to make diesel out of the biogas by the fischer tropsch method increasingly ethanol is being used at low concentrations 10 or less as an additive in gasoline gasohol for motor fuels to increase the octane rating lower pollutants and reduce petroleum use what is nowadays also known as biofuels and has been generating an intense debate regarding the human beings necessity of new sources of energy on the one hand and the need to maintain in regions such as latin america the food habits and culture which has been the essence of civilizations such as the one originated in mesoamerica the entry january 2008 of maize among the commercial agreements of nafta has increased this debate considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields and mainly the fact that nafta opened the doors to the import of maize from the united states where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports  according to oxfam uk after nafta went into effect the price of maize in mexico fell 70 between 1994 and 2001 the number of farm jobs dropped as well from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002 many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers86 however introduction in the northern latitudes of the us of tropical maize for biofuels and not for human or animal consumption may potentially alleviate this as a result of the us federal government announcing its production target of 35billion us gallons 130,000,000m3 of biofuels by 2017 ethanol production will grow to 7billion us gallons 26,000,000m3 by 2010 up from 4.5 billion in 2006 boosting ethanols share of maize demand in the us from 22.6 percent to 36.1 percent87 ornamental and other uses main article corn construction some forms of the plant are occasionally grown for ornamental use in the garden for this purpose variegated and colored leaf forms as well as those with colorful ears are used corncobs can be hollowed out and treated to make inexpensive smoking pipes first manufactured in the united states in 1869 children playing in a maize kernel box an unusual use for maize is to create a corn maze or maize maze as a tourist attraction the idea of a maize maze was introduced by the american maze company who created a maze in pennsylvania in 1993.88 traditional mazes are most commonly grown using yew hedges but these take several years to mature the rapid growth of a field of maize allows a maze to be laid out using gps at the start of a growing season and for the maize to grow tall enough to obstruct a visitors line of sight by the start of the summer in canada and the us these are popular in many farming communities maize kernels can be used in place of sand in a sandboxlike enclosure for childrens play89 stigmas from female maize flowers popularly called corn silk are sold as herbal supplementscitation needed maize is used as a fish bait called dough balls it is particularly popular in europe for coarse fishing additionally feed corn is sometimes used by hunters to bait animals such as deer or wild hogs fodder maize produces a greater quantity of biomass than other cereal plants which is used for fodder digestibility and palatability are higher when ensiled and fermented rather than dried commodity maize is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity using corn futures contracts these futures are traded on the chicago board of trade cbot under ticker symbol c they are

feedstock use for ethanol production has somewhat exceeded direct use for livestock feed maize use for fuel ethanol was 5,130 million bushels 130 million tonnes in the 20132014 marketing year92 a fraction of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as ddgs dried distillers grains with solubles in the 20102011 marketing year about 29.1 million tonnes of ddgs were fed to us livestock and poultry93 because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue the feed value per kg of ddgs with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein exceeds that of the grain feed value for monogastric animals such as swine and poultry is somewhat lower than for ruminants93 comparison

was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-american peoples it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity however a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a staple food this was a mystery since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous americans for whom maize was the principal staple food99 it was eventually discovered that the indigenous americans had learned to soak maize in alkali-watermade with ashes and lime calcium oxide since at least 12001500 bc by mesoamericans and north americanswhich liberates the b-vitamin niacin the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as pellagra100 maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the americas in the late 19th century pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern us as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin the deficiency theory which was eventually shown to be true said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies a third theory promoted by the eugenicist charles davenport held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain constitutional inheritable traits of the affected individual101 once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied pellagra disappeared in the developed world the development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize102 allergy maize contains lipid transfer protein an indigestible protein that survives cooking this protein has been linked to a rare and understudied allergy to maize in humans103 the allergic reaction can cause skin rash swelling or itching of mucous membranes diarrhea vomiting asthma and in severe cases anaphylaxis it is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population art gold maize moche culture 300 ad larco museum lima peru water tower in rochester minnesota being painted as an ear of maize maize has been an essential crop in the andes since the pre-columbian era the moche culture from northern peru made ceramics from earth water and fire this pottery was a sacred substance formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes maize represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally104 in the united states maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the united states capitol building maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season local agricultural productivity and culture bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses a well-known example of architectural use is the corn palace in mitchell south dakota which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually a maize stalk with two ripe ears is depicted on the reverse of the croatian 1 lipa coin minted
