for the rock band see natural gas band the global natural gas trade in 2013 numbers are in billion cubic meters per year1 natural gas extraction by countries in cubic meters per year natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide nitrogen hydrogen sulfide or helium2 it is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the earth over millions of years the energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas3 natural gas is a fossil fuel used as a source of energy for heating cooking and electricity generation it is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals it is a non-renewable resource3 natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found in close proximity to and with natural gas most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms biogenic and thermogenic biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes bogs landfills and shallow sediments deeper in the earth at greater temperature and pressure thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material45 when gas is associated with petroleum production it may be considered a byproduct and be burnt as flare gas the world bank estimates that over 150 cubic kilometers of natural gas are flared or vented annually6 before natural gas can be used as a fuel it must be processed to remove impurities including water to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas the by-products of this processing include ethane propane butanes pentanes and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons hydrogen sulfide which may be converted into pure sulfur carbon dioxide water vapor and sometimes helium and nitrogen natural gas is often informally referred to simply as gas especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal however it is not to be confused with gasoline especially in north america where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas natural gas was used by the chinese in about 500 bce possibly even 1000 bce7 they discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to extract the salt8 in the ziliujing district of sichuan the worlds first industrial extraction of natural gas started at fredonia new york united states in 1825.9 by 2009 66 000 km or 8 had been used out of the total 850 000 km of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas10 based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400 km of gas per year the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates an annual increase in usage of 23 could result in currently recoverable

by-product of producing oil since the small light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields if there was not a market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user in the 19th century and early 20th century unwanted gas was usually burned off at oil fields today unwanted gas or stranded gas without a market associated with oil extraction often is returned to the reservoir with injection wells while awaiting a possible future market or to repressurize the formation which can enhance extraction rates from other wells in regions with a high natural gas demand such as the us pipelines are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an end consumer in addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas lng or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids gtl technologies gtl technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline diesel or jet fuel a variety of gtl technologies have been developed including fischertropsch ft methanol to gasoline mtg and stg ft produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products while mtg can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas stg can produce drop-in gasoline diesel jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process11 in 2011 royal dutch shells 140,000 barrel 16 dam per day ft plant went into operation in qatar natural gas can be associated found in oil fields or non-associated isolated in natural gas fields and is also found in coal beds as coalbed methane12 it sometimes contains a significant amount of ethane propane butane and pentaneheavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the methane being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock non-hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide nitrogen helium rarely and hydrogen sulfide must also be removed before the natural gas can be transported13 natural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet or associated gas the natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging resource types sour gas tight gas shale gas and coalbed methane there is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves sources that consider that russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the us cia 47 600 km14 the us energy information administration 47 800 km15 and opec 48 700 km16 however bp credits russia with only 32 900 km17 which would place it in second place slightly behind iran 33 100 to 33 800 km

qatar 25 100 2013 turkmenistan 17 500 2013 and the united states 8500 2013 it is estimated that there are about 900 000 km of unconventional gas such as shale gas of which 180 000 km may be recoverable18 in turn many studies from mit black veatch and the doe predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future19 the worlds largest gas field is the offshore south pars north dome gas-condensate field shared between iran and qatar it is estimated to have 51 000 cubic kilometers of natural gas and 50 billion barrels 6 km of natural gas condensates because natural gas is not a pure product as the reservoir pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical pressuretemperature conditions the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizingan effect called retrograde condensation the liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted one method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates more frequently the liquid condenses at the surface and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate the resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid ngl and has commercial value

shale gas shale gas is natural gas produced from shale because shale has matrix permeability too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by hydraulic fracturing since 2000 shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the united states and canada20 following the success in the united states shale gas exploration is beginning in countries such as poland china and south africa212223 because of this increase in shale production the united states is now the number one natural gas producer in the world24 town gasedit main article history of manufactured gas town gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of coal it contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen carbon monoxide methane and other volatile hydrocarbons together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen and is used in a similar way to natural gas this is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today still it remains the best option in some specific cases and it may be so into the future most town gashouses located in the eastern us in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers the gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century the coal tar or asphalt that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets biogasedit main article biogas methanogenic archaea are responsible for all biological sources of methane some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms including termites ruminants and cultivated crops other sources of methane the principal component of natural gas include landfill gas biogas and methane hydrate when methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter biomass these are referred to as biogas or natural biogas sources of biogas include swamps marshes and landfills see landfill gas as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure25 by way of anaerobic digesters in addition to enteric fermentation particularly in cattle landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites excluding water vapor about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes if the gas is not removed the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface causing damage to the landfill structure unpleasant odor vegetation die-off and an explosion hazard the gas can be vented to the atmosphere flared or burned to produce electricity or heat biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills this method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts like landfill gas biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen however with the exception of pesticides there are usually lower levels of contaminants landfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3 per cent co2 and a few parts per million h 2s because co2 and h 2s corrode the pipelines26 the presence of co2 will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipelineclarification needed siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system consequently it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline water vapor is often removed even if the gas is burned on site if low temperatures condense water out of the gas siloxanes can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor other non-methane components may also be removed to meet emission standards to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion which lowers emissions biogas and especially landfill gas are already used in some areas but their use could be greatly expanded experimental systems were being proposedwhen for use in parts of hertfordshire uk and lyon in francecitation needed using materials that would otherwise generate no income or even cost money to get rid of improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production gas generated in sewage treatment plants is commonly used to generate electricity for example the hyperion sewage plant in los angeles burns 8million cubic feet 230,000m3 of gas per day to generate power27 new york city utilizes gas to run equipment in the sewage plants to generate electricity and in boilers28 using sewage gas to make electricity is not limited to large cities the city of bakersfield california uses cogeneration at its sewer plants29 california has 242 sewage wastewater treatment plants 74 of which have installed anaerobic digesters the total biopower generation from the 74 plants is about 66 mw30 the mcmahon natural gas processing plant in taylor british columbia canada31 crystallized natural gas hydratesedit huge quantities of natural gas primarily methane exist in the form of hydrates under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience permafrost such as those in siberia hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form in 2010 the cost of extracting natural gas from crystallized natural gas was estimated to be as much as twice the cost of extracting natural gas from conventional sources and even higher from offshore deposits32 in 2013 japan oil gas and metals national corporation jogmec announced that they had recovered commercially relevant quantities of natural gas from methane hydrate33 natural gas processingedit main

peak in 1973 and went over a second lower peak in 2001 but recently has peaked again and is continuing to rise39 40 usesedit natural gas is primarily used in the northern hemisphere north america and europe are major consumers mid-stream natural gasedit natural gas flowing in the distribution lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines these engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission these compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels the natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a british thermal unit btu value between 950 and 1050btus the processed natural gas may then be used for residential commercial and industrial uses often mid-stream and well head gases require removal of many of the various hydrocarbon species contained within the natural gas some of these gases include heptane pentane propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above methane ch4 to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission typically natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050btu per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications several methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use at the natural gas engine a few technologies are as follows joulethomson skid cryogenic or chiller system chemical enzymology system41 power generationedit natural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of cogeneration gas turbines and steam turbines natural gas is also well suited for a combined use in association with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar42 and for alimenting peak-load power stations functioning in tandem with hydroelectric plants most grid peaking power plants and some off-grid engine-generators use natural gas particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode natural gas burns more cleanly than other hydrocarbon fuels such as oil and coal and produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released for transportation burning natural gas produces about 30 percent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum for an equivalent amount of heat burning natural gas produces about 45 percent less carbon dioxide than burning coal for power43 the us energy information administration reports the following emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide in the world for 201244 natural gas 6,799 petroleum 11,695 coal 13,787 coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant per megawatt hour generated45 because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation as the fuel mix in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.46 combined cycle power generation using natural gas is currently the cleanest available source of power using hydrocarbon fuels and this technology is widely and increasingly used as natural gas can be obtained at increasingly reasonable costs fuel cell technology may eventually provide cleaner options for converting natural gas into electricity but as yet it is not price-competitive locally produced electricity and heat using natural gas powered combined heat and power plant chp or cogeneration plant is considered energy efficient and a rapid way to cut carbon emissions47 natural gas power plants are increasing in popularity and generate 22 of the worlds total electricity approximately half as much as generated with coal48 domestic useedit natural gas dispensed in a residential setting can generate temperatures in excess of 1100c 2000f making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel49 in much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens gas-heated clothes dryers heatingcooling and central heating heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers furnaces and water heaters both north america and europe are major consumers of natural gas boilers use low pressure usually 6 to 7 inches of water 6 to 7 wc which is about 0.25 psig the pressures in the supply lines under the streets vary either utilization pressure up the aforementioned 6 to 7 wc or elevated pressure ep which may be anywhere from 1 psig to 120 psig systems using ep have a regulator at the service entrance to step down the pressure to up in the us compressed natural gas cng is used in rural homes without connections to piped-in public utility services or with portable grillscitation needed natural gas is also supplied by independent natural gas suppliers through natural gas choice programs throughout the united states however as cng costs more than lpg lpg propane is the dominant source of rural gas a washington dc metrobus which runs on natural gas transportationedit cng is a cleaner and also cheaper alternative to other automobile fuels such as gasoline petrol and diesel by the end of 2012 there were 17.25 million natural gas vehicles worldwide led by iran 3.3 million pakistan 3.1 million argentina 2.18 million brazil 1.73 million india 1.5 million and china 1.5 million50 the energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines but lower compared with modern diesel engines gasolinepetrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas 1015 cng-specific engines however use a higher compression ratio due to this fuels higher octane number of 120130.51 52 besides use in road vehicles it is also used in aerial vehicles compressed natural gas has been used in some aircraft like the aviat aircraft husky 200 cng535455 and the chromarat vx-1 kittyhawk56 lng is also being used in aircraft russian aircraft manufacturer tupolev for instance is running a development program to produce lng- and hydrogen-powered aircraft57 the program has been running since the mid-1970s and seeks to develop lng and hydrogen variants of the tu-204 and tu-334 passenger aircraft and also the tu-330 cargo aircraft it claims that at current market prices an lng-powered aircraft would cost 5,000 roubles us218 112 less to operate per ton roughly equivalent to 60 per cent with considerable reductions to carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions the advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency in effect replacing an intercooler alternatively it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust fertilizersedit natural gas is a major feedstock

in a trench because of its low density it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up many existing pipelines in america are close to reaching their capacity prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages the large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated causing significant price differences across countries in western europe the gas pipeline network is already dense58 new pipelines are planned or under construction in eastern europe and between gas fields in russia near east and northern africa and western europe see also list of natural gas pipelines lng carriers transport liquefied natural gas lng across oceans while tank trucks can carry liquefied or compressed natural gas cng over shorter distances sea transport using cng carrier ships that are now under development may be competitive with lng transport in specific conditions gas is turned into liquid at a liquefaction plant and is returned to gas form at regasification plant at the terminal shipborne regasification equipment is also used lng is the preferred form for long distance high volume transportation of natural gas whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to 4,000km 2,485mi over land and approximately half that distance offshore cng is transported at high pressure typically above 200 bars compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefactionregasification plants natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end-users or to distribution points such as pipelines peoples gas manlove field natural gas storage area in newcomb township champaign county illinois in the foreground left is one of the numerous wells for the underground storage area with an lng plant and above ground storage tanks are in the background right in the past the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring flaring is now illegal in many countries59 additionally higher demand in the last 2030 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable as a further option the gas is now sometimes re-injected into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding conservation re-injection or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets pipelines and regulatory restrictions natural gas can be indirectly exported through the absorption in other physical output a recent study suggests that the expansion of shale gas production in the us has caused prices to drop relative to other countries this has caused a boom in energy intensive manufacturing sector exports whereby the average dollar unit of us manufacturing exports has almost tripled its energy content between 1996 and 2012.60 a master gas system was invented in saudi arabia in the late 1970s ending any necessity for flaring satellite observation however shows that flaring61 and venting62 are still practiced in some gas-extracting countries natural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for desalination similarly some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity natural gas is often stored underground inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells salt domes or in tanks as liquefied natural gas the gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands but such storage may not always be practicable with 15 countries accounting for 84 per cent of the worldwide extraction access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics and countries vie for control of pipelines63 in the first decade of the 21st century gazprom the state-owned energy company in russia engaged in disputes with ukraine and belarus over the price of natural gas which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of europe could be cut off for political reasons64 the united states is preparing to export natural gas65 floating liquefied natural gas flng is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped because due to environmental or economic factors it is nonviable to develop them via a land-based lng operation flng technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages environmental because all processing is done at the gas field there is no requirement for long pipelines to shore compression units to pump the gas to shore dredging and jetty construction and onshore construction of an lng processing plant which significantly reduces the environmental footprint66 avoiding construction also helps preserve marine and coastal environments in addition environmental disturbance will be minimised during decommissioning because the facility can easily be disconnected and removed before being refurbished and re-deployed elsewhere economic where pumping gas to shore can be prohibitively expensive flng makes development economically viable as a result it will open up new business opportunities for countries to develop offshore gas fields that would otherwise remain stranded such as those offshore east africa67 many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of floating liquefied natural gas flng there are currently projects underway to construct five flng facilities petronas is close to completion on their flng-168 at daewoo shipbuilding and marine engineering and are underway69 on their flng-2 project at samsung heavy industries shell prelude is due to start production 2017 and the browse lng project has completed feed with final investment decisions expected in mid-201670 environmental effectsedit see also environmental impact of the energy industry effect of natural gas releaseedit see also atmospheric methane natural gas is mainly composed of methane after release to the atmosphere it is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals oh formed in the troposphere or stratosphere giving the overall chemical reaction ch4 2o2 co2 2h2o.7172 while the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide73 with a half-life of about 7 years74 it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere so that a given quantity of methane has 84 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 28 times over a 100-year period natural gas is thus a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide due to the greater global-warming potential of methane75 but because when it is burned it produces more water than carbon dioxide by mole in contrast to coal which produces mainly carbon dioxide it produces only about half the carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour that coal does current estimates by the epa place global emissions of methane at 85billion cubic metres 3.01012cuft annually73 or 3.2 per cent of global production76 direct emissions of methane represented 14.3 per cent by volume of all global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2004.77 during extraction storage transportation and distribution natural gas is known to leak into the atmosphere particularly during the extraction process a cornell university study in 2011 demonstrated that the leak rate of methane may be high enough to jeopardize its global warming advantage over coal78 this study was criticized later for its over-estimation of methane leakage values79 preliminary results of some air sampling from airplanes done by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration indicated higher-than-estimated methane releases by gas wells in some areas80 but the overall results showed methane emissions in line with previous epa estimates81 natural gas extraction also releases an isotope of radon ranging in activity from 5 to 200,000 becquerels per cubic meter of gas82 co2 emissionsedit natural gas is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel it produces about 29 and 44 less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than oil and coal respectively43 and potentially fewer pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels83 however in absolute terms it comprises a substantial percentage of human carbon emissions and this contribution is projected to grow according to the ipcc fourth assessment report in 2004 natural gas produced about 5.3 billion tons a year of co2 emissions while coal and oil produced 10.6 and 10.2 billion tons respectively according to an updated version of the special report on emissions scenario by 2030 natural gas would be the source of 11 billion tons a year with coal and oil now 8.4 and 17.2 billion respectively because demand is increasing 1.9 percent a year other pollutantsedit natural gas produces far lower amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides than other fossil fuels84 the other pollutants due to natural gas combustion are listed

sour gas containing hydrogen sulfide h2s this untreated gas is toxic amine gas treating an industrial scale process which removes acidic gaseous components is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas86 extraction of natural gas or oil leads to decrease in pressure in the reservoir such decrease in pressure in turn may result in subsidence sinking of the ground above subsidence may affect ecosystems waterways sewer and water supply systems foundations and so oncitation needed frackingedit main article environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing releasing natural gas from subsurface porous rock formations may be accomplished by a process called hydraulic fracturing or fracking its estimated that hydraulic fracturing will eventually account for nearly 70 of natural gas development in north america87 since the first commercial hydraulic fracturing operation in 1949 approximately one million wells have been hydraulically fractured in the united states88 the production of natural gas from hydraulically fractured wells has utilized the technological developments of directional and horizontal drilling which improved access to natural gas in tight rock formations89 strong growth in the production of unconventional gas from hydraulically fractured wells occurred between 2000-2012.90 in hydraulic fracturing well operators force water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock the high pressure water breaks up or fracks the rock which releases gas from the rock formation sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion after the frack oil or gas is extracted and nearly 30 percent to 70 percent of the frack fluid ie the mixture of water chemicals sand etc flows back to the surface many gas-bearing formations also contain water which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells this produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation91 the volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique in the united states the average volume of water used per hydraulic fracture has been reported as nearly 7,375 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells prior to 1953 nearly 197,000 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells between 2000-2010 and nearly 3 million gallons for horizontal gas wells between 2000-2010.92 determining which fracking technique is appropriate for well productivity depends largely on the properties of the reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas if the rock is characterized by low-permeability which refers to its ability to let substances ie gas pass through it then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas93 fracking for shale gas which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally94 in contrast conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required9596 the decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health979899100101 the us epa has acknowledged that toxic carcinogenic chemicals ie benzene and ethylbenzene have been used as gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing hvhf102 following the hydraulic fracture in hvhf the water chemicals and frack fluid that return to the wells surface called flowback or produced water may contain radioactive materials heavy metals natural salts and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations103 fracking chemicals radioactive materials heavy metals and salts that are removed from the hvhf well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water theyre mixed with and would so heavily pollute the water cycle that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells eliminating the water that hvhf required from the hydrologic cycle104 added odoredit in order to assist in detecting leaks a minute amount of odorant is added to the otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas used by consumers the odor has been compared to the smell of rotten eggs due to the added tert-butylthiol t-butyl mercaptan sometimes a related compound thiophane may be used in the mixture situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell have occurred in the natural gas industry this is caused by odor masking when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another as of 2011 the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking105 risk of explosionedit gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in kiev ukraine explosions caused by natural gas leaks occur a few times each year individual homes small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure frequently the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing in these cases the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries occasionally the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion disintegrating one or more buildings in the process the gas usually dissipates readily outdoors but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough however considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel the individual risk of using natural gas is very low risk of carbon monoxide inhalationedit natural gas heating systems may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if unvented or poorly vented in 2011 natural gas furnaces space heaters water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the us another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced co poisoning concerns detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide andor explosive gas methane propane etc106 energy content statistics and pricingedit main article natural gas prices see also billion cubic metres of natural gas natural gas prices at the henry hub in us dollars per million btus mmbtu comparison of natural gas prices in japan united kingdom and united states 20072011 quantities of natural gas are measured in normal cubic meters corresponding to 0c at 101.325 kpa or in standard cubic feet corresponding to 60f 16c and 14.73 psia the gross heat of combustion of 1m3 of commercial quality natural gas is around 39mj 10.8kwh but this can vary by several percent this comes to about 49mj 13.5kwh for 1kg of natural gas assuming a density of 0.8kg m3 an approximate valuecitation needed the price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer in 2007 a price of 7 per 1000 cubic feet about 25 cents per m3 was typical in the united states the typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000 british thermal units btu per cubic foot depending on gas composition this corresponds to around 7 per million btu or around 7 per gigajoule in april 2008 the wholesale price was 10 per 1,000 cubic feet 28m3 10mmbtu.107 the residential price varies from 50 to 300 more than the wholesale price at the end of 2007 this was 1216 per 1000 cubic feet about 50 cents per m3108 natural gas in the united states is traded as a futures contract on the new york mercantile exchange each contract is for 10,000mmbtu 10,550 gigajoules or 10 billion btu thus if the price of gas is 10 per million btus on the nymex the contract is worth 100,000 european unionedit gas prices for end users vary greatly across the eu109 a single european energy market one of the key objectives of the eu should level the prices of gas in all eu member states moreover it would help to resolve supply and global warming issues110 as well as strengthen relations with other mediterranean countries and foster investments in the region111 united statesedit us natural gas marketed production 1900 to 2012 source us eia in us units one standard cubic foot 1 cubic foot 28l of natural gas produces around 1,028 british thermal units 1,085kj the actual heating value when the water formed does not condense is the net heat of combustion and can be as much as 10 less112 in the united states retail sales are often in units of therms th 1 therm 100,000btu gas meters measure the volume of gas used and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period which varies slightly over time wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms dth or in thousand decatherms mdth or in million decatherms mmdth a million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas gas sales to domestic consumers may be in units of 100 standard cubic feet scf the typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one rce canadaedit canada uses metric measure for internal trade of petrochemical products consequently natural gas is sold by the gigajoule cubic metre m3 or thousand cubic metres e3m3 distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume cubic foot or cubic meter some jurisdictions such as saskatchewan sell gas by volume only other jurisdictions such as alberta gas is sold by the energy content gj in these areas almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume m3 or ft3 and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply a gigajoule gj is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel 250lbs of oil or 1 million btus or 1000cu ft of gas or 28m3 of gas the energy content of gas supply in canada can vary from 37 to 43 mj per m3 depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer elsewhereedit in the rest of the world natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units lng liquefied natural gas and lpg liquefied petroleum gas are traded in metric tons or mmbtu as spot deliveries long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic metres and lng contracts are in metric tonnes 1,000kg the lng and lpg is transported by specialized transport ships as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures the specification of each lnglpg cargo will usually contain the energy content but this information is in general not available to the public in the russian federation gazprom sold approximately 250 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2008 in 2013 the group produced 487.4 billion cubic meters of natural and associated gas gazprom supplied europe with 161.5 billion cubic meters of gas in 2013 in august 2015 possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an italian gas company eni the energy company indicated that it has unearthed a supergiant gas field in the mediterranean sea covering about 40 square miles it was also reported that the gas field could hold a potential 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas eni said that it is about the energy equivalent of 5.5 billion barrels of oil the field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of egypt and eni claims that it will be the largest ever in the mediterranean and even the world113 natural gas as an asset class for institutional investorsedit research conducted by the world pensions council wpcwhen suggests that large us and canadian pension funds and asian and mena area swf investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure a trend started in 2005 by the formation of scotia gas networks in the uk by omers and ontario teachers pension plancitation needed adsorbed natural gas angedit another way to store natural gas is adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents the best condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the used pressure can be up to 4 mpa about 40 times atmospheric pressure for having more storage capacity the most common sorbent used for ang is activated carbon ac three main types of activated carbons for ang are activated carbon fiber acf powdered activated carbon pac activated carbon monolith114 see alsoedit
