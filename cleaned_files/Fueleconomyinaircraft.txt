a boeing 747 in cruise flight aircraft like this burn jet fuel aircraft must consume fuel to supply the energy needed to move the vehicles and their passengers fuel economy is a measure of how much fuel an aircraft needs to operate and can be expressed in several ways for example by the liters of fuel consumed per passenger per kilometer aerodynamic drag which exerts a force on the aircraft in the opposite direction from the velocity is a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft because they operate at such high speeds contents 1 factors in aircraft fuel economy 1.1 changes in commercial aircraft fuel economy since the 1950s 1.2 jet aircraft efficiency 1.2.1 weight effect 1.2.2 aerodynamics 1.3 fuel consumption factors 1.3.1 propellers versus jets 1.4 range 2 airline fuel efficiency 3 example values 3.1 turboprop 3.2 regional 3.3 short haul 3.4 medium haul 3.5 long haul 4 see also 5 references factors in aircraft fuel economyedit each model of aircraft has a maximum range speed for a given total load fuel plus payload which is the speed at which it is most fuel efficient1 flying slower or faster than this optimum speed increases fuel consumption per mile flown there is an optimum speed for efficiency because the component of drag resulting from airframe skin friction against the air increases at a square function of air speed but the drag resulting from generating lift decreases with air speed these are technically called parasitic drag and induced drag respectively1 the desirability of a low maximum range speed to reduce environmental and climate impacts is at odds in aircraft design with the benefit from the revenue generated by making the design speed higher thereby increasing the passenger miles flown per day2 aircraft weight is also a factor in fuel economy because more lift-generating drag induced drag results as weight increases if the airframe weight is reduced engines that are smaller and lighter can be used and for a given range the fuel capacity can be reduced thus some weight savings can be compounded for an increase in fuel efficiency a rule-of-thumb being that a 1 weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75 reduction in fuel consumption3 flight altitude affects engine efficiency jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause the temperature minimum of the atmosphere at lower temperatures the engine efficiency is higher1 jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds but above about mach 0.85 the aerodynamic drag on the airframe overwhelms this effect above that speed shockwaves begin to form that greatly increase drag for supersonic flight mach 1.0 or higher fuel consumption is increased tremendously changes in commercial aircraft fuel economy since the 1950sedit although modern jet aircraft have twice the fuel efficiency of the earliest jet airliners 4 they are only slightly more fuel efficient than the latest piston engine airliners of the late 1950s such as the lockheed l-1649 starliner and douglas dc-72 nonetheless jets have about twice the cruise speed the early jet airliners were designed at a time when air crew labor costs were higher relative to fuel costs than today despite the high fuel consumption because fuel was inexpensive in that era the higher speed resulted in favorable economical returns since crew costs and amortization of capital investment in the aircraft could be spread over more seat miles flown per day5 todays turboprop airliners have better fuel efficiency than current jet airliners in part because of their lower cruising speed and propellers that are more efficient than those of the 1950s-era piston-powered airlines6 among major airlines those with turboprop equipped regional carrier subsidiaries typically rank high in overall fleet fuel efficiency for example although alaska airlines scored at the top of a 2011-2012 fuel efficiency ranking if its regional carrierturbo-prop equipped horizon airwere dropped from the consideration the airlines ranking would be lower6 jet aircraft efficiencyedit jet aircraft efficiency is improving between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55 overall fuel efficiency gain if one were to consider the boeing 707 as the base case2 most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4 concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon which is 16.7 l100km per passenger similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus states a fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l100km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon7 however this is for an unspecified number and configuration of seats the maximum configuration is 850 economy passengers but with a typical 525-seat multi-class configuration the fuel consumption is comparable to that of a b747-400 er and even about 15 worse than a b777-300er on a passenger-mile basis8 weight effectedit as over 80 of the fully laden take-off weight of a modern aircraft such as the airbus a380 is craft and fuelcitation needed there remains considerable room for future improvements in fuel efficiency the weight of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduce the amount of fuel an aircraft must carry this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore provides further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials the boeing 787 dreamliner was the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage composite wings and use composites in most other airframe components9 very long non-stop flights suffer from the weight penalty of the large quantity of fuel required limiting the number of available seats to compensate for such flights the critical fiscal factor is the quantity of fuel burnt per seat-nautical mile10 for these reasons the worlds longest commercial flights were cancelled circa 2013 an example is singapore airs former new york to singapore flight which could carry only 100 passengers all business class on the 10,300 mile flight according to an industry analyst it was pretty much a fuel tanker in the air11 aerodynamicsedit main article lift-to-drag ratio airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption1213 there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption14 winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing can be retrofitted to any airplane and smooths out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircrafts wing drag14 nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb 230kg blended wing aircraft this design provides greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings15 the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over todays more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs1617 nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect18 aircraft is a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint fuel consumption

propellers versus jetsedit propfans are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph 700kmh.20 this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current needs update high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engineairframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans21 nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds for private aircraft in general aviation the current record is 37kmkg fuel or 3.7 l100km in a monnett sonerai22 related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate rangeedit for very long haul flights the airplane is heavier to transport additional fuel leading to a higher fuel consumption above a certain distance it becomes more fuel efficient to make a halfway stop to refuel even if it leads to an additional less efficient descent and climb for example for a boeing 777-300 the tipping point is at 3,000 nautical miles 5,600km it is more fuel efficient to make a non-stop flight below this distance and to make a stop above23 boeing 777-224 fuel burn per distance against range airline fuel efficiencyedit fuel economy in air transport comes from aircraft fuel efficiency combined with
