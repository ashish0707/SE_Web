correct depth take full advantage deep sound channel sofar bomb sink fast reaches required depth reasonable amount time 5 minutes2 determine position sofar bomb detonated naval stations combine reports received signal benefits deep sound channeledit detonating sofar bomb deep sound channel huge benefits channel helps sound waves contained depth rays sound upward downward velocity pushed back deep sound channel refraction sound waves spread vertically horizontal sound rays maintain strength makes easier stations shore pick analyze signal blasts frequencies 30 150hz helps stop signal weakening side effect slightly higher frequencies sound waves emitted move bit faster lower frequencies making signal naval stations hear longer duration historyedit dr maurice ewing pioneer
