lowestoft uk formed a joint venture scira offshore energy to develop a c 315mw wind farm development work for econventures was to be carried out by evelop bv both subsidiaries of econcern bv2 in 2005 hydro took a 50 stake in scira acquiring 25 shareholdings from both slp energy and ecocentures3 in 2006 scira submitted a planning application to the department of trade and industry for a 108 turbine 315 mw wind farm4 the planned wind farm was approximately 18 kilometres 11mi off the coast of norfolk at sheringham just within the 12nm uk territorial water boundary and 5 kilometres 3.1mi north of the sand bank known as sheringham shoal the wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 metres 52 to 72ft and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities lack of any dredging dumping oilgas or mod practice areas and of cables or pipelines as well as low visual impact from the coast and outside any nature conservation areas5 the seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand overlying chalk6 the electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near muckleburgh collection via landfall near weybourne hope7 two routes were considered for the export cable one avoiding the sand bank atsheringham shoal8 the connection to the national grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near salle norfolk via a 132kv 21.3 kilometres 13.2mi underground cable9 planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 august 2008.10 in 2009 statkraft acquired 50 of the shareholding in scira becoming joint 5050 owners of the development11 in 2014 the green investment bank took a 240 million 20 stake in the wind farm12 the lease on the sea bed given by the crown estate has a duration of 50 years and the initial wind farm has an estimated lifespan of 20 years the 2004 energy act requires the developer to decommission the wind farm once out of use - the decommissioning plan submitted by the developer included removal of wind turbines cutting of foundations at seabed level or lower whilst interarray cables would be left on the sea bed13 constructionedit turbine installation vessel gms endeavour 30 september 2011 in april 2008 nexans was awarded a 24m contract for the supply and construction of the 145kv export cables14 and was awarded a 12m 15.8m contract in april 2009 to supply 81km of 36kv inter-array cables15 areva obtained a 50 million contract to supply offshore and onshore substations in late 2008,1617 design and project management of the offshore substations was sub-contracted to wood group18 design work on the turbine and substation foundations was contracted to ramboll19 the two foundations for the

wind turbines to the wind farm23 onshore work began in 2009,24 and construction of the offshore part began march 2010.2526 turbine foundations installation begain in june 201027 mt hjgaard installed the substation piles and 17 of the turbine foundations using the vessel svanen halting installation due to a previously scheduled contract for the installation vessel20 the foundations installed by mt hjgaard used a special method the support of the foundation on the delivery barge had its motion steadied by a 135t sliding support with hydraulic motors compensating for wave oscillations2829 delays of several months of the arrival of foundation transport vessels coupled with wave conditions limiting the operational window of use of the transport vessels meant that the vessel svanen was not able to install all the foundations the delay had an estimated additional cost of 600million nokcitation needed export cable installation began late 2010 under contract to visser smith marine contracting work was carried out by the ships atlantic guardian route clearance team oman laying and vos sympathy trenching30 the offshore substations were installed in may 2011 by heerema31 the remaining pile
