a meps minimum energy performance standard is a specification containing a number of performance requirements for an energy-using device that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task a meps is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body it may include requirements not directly related to energy this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency a meps generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured in north america when addressing energy efficiency a meps is sometimes referred to simply as a standard as in co-operation on labeling and standards programs in latin america when addressing energy efficiency meps are sometimes referred to as normas translated as norms contents 1 examples 2 california 3 australia 4 brazil 5 new zealand 6 see also 7 references 8 external

while using at most a specified amount of electricity the energy use allowed varies according to volume number of doors the function of the various compartments and other parameters this graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in us refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first california then us meps starting in the mid-1970s price volume and efficiency of refrigerators an electric fan is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power a storage water heater providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy in this example the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency an electric induction motor is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency a compact fluorescent lamp is required to start and run up to near full brightness in a given time to have a minimum life of several thousand hours to maintain its output within specified limits to withstand a certain number of switchings to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy light output per electrical input californiaedit in the us the state of california was a pioneer 1 in the introduction of meps in order to reduce the growth in electricity use the california energy commission cec was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state it started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978 and has updated the standards regularly over time and expanded the list of covered appliances in 1988 californias standards became national standards for the us through the enactment of the national appliance energy conservation act naeca the federal standards preempted state standards unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state and since then the us department of energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards california has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated and therefore not preempted in recent yearswhen the cecs attention has been focused on consumer electronics for which energy use has been growing dramatically australiaedit meps programs are made mandatory in australia by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant australian standards it is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into australia to meet the meps levels specified by the relevant australian standards calendar of implementation of meps in australia2 appliance date refrigerators and

motors and compact fluorescent lamps new zealandedit on 5 february 2002 new zealand introduced minimum energy performance standards meps with energy efficiency regulations meps and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of ourwho products and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy products covered by meps must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers meps have been updated over the years 2002 2003 2004 2008 2011 to cover a wide range of products and increasing levels of stringency new zealand works with australia to harmonise meps levels almost all of its standards are joint standards with australia new zealand has mandatory energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers fridges washing machines and room air conditioners meps apply to the following4 refrigerators and freezers washing machines air conditioners computer room air conditioners chillers electric water storage heaters gas
