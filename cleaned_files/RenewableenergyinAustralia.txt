renewable electricity generation by energy source 2010 renewable energy in australia deals with efforts being made in australia to quantify and expand renewable energy which includes electricity transport fuels and thermal energy total renewable energy consumption in australia in 2015 was 346pj representing 5.9 of australias total energy consumption1 this is an increase of 1.6 from 201112 levels 265pj representing 4.3 of australias total energy consumption2 of all renewable energy consumption in 2015 in order of contribution biomass wood woodwaste and bagasse represents 53 hydroelectricity 19.2 wind 10.7 solar pv 5.1 biogas 4.7 solar hot water 3.8 and biofuels 3.6.3 bioenergy the sum of all energy derived from plant matter represented 61.3 211.9pj of australias total renewable energy consumption in 2015.3 renewable electricity has undergone substantial growth in australia in the 21st century it is estimated that australia produced 35,007 gigawatt hours gwh of renewable electricity or equivalent over the year ending december 2015 representing 14.6 of the total production in australia4 by way of comparison in 2006 approximately 9,500gwh of electricity came from renewable sources representing less than 4 of nationally generated electricity5citation needed of all renewable electrical sources in 2012 hydroelectricity represented 57.8 wind 26 bioenergy 8.1 solar pv 8 large-scale solar 0.147 geothermal 0.002 and marine 0.001 additionally solar hot water heating was estimated to replace a further 2,422gwh of electrical generation6 similar to many other countries development of renewable electricity in australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change energy independence and economic stimulus7 a key policy that has been in place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations this was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the abbott government with the agreement of the labor opposition8 alongside this there is the small-scale renewable energy scheme an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water9 and several state schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics in 2012 these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects10 although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the federal government11 it has been suggested that with sufficient public and private sector investment and government policy certainty australia could switch entirely to renewable energy within a decade by building additional large-scale solar and wind power developments upgrading to transmission infrastructure and introduction of appropriate energy efficiency measures712 contents 1 renewable energy

therefore the transition to a renewable energy system is gaining momentum in the peer-reviewed scientific literature among them several studies have examined the feasibility of a transition to a 100 renewable electricity systems which was found both practicable as well as economically and environmentally beneficial to combat global warming141516 hydro poweredit the snowy mountains scheme constructed between 1949 and 1974 consists of sixteen major dams and seven major power stations and has a total generating capacity of 3,800mw the scheme generates on average 4,500 gwh electricity per year17 hydro tasmania operates thirty power stations and fifty dams and has a total generating capacity of 2,600mw each year an average of 9,000 gwh of hydro-electricity is generated by the company18 in 200708 hydro-electricity represented 15 of renewable energy production in australia19 in 2015 this had risen to 40 of renewable energy production4 wind poweredit main article wind power in australia windy hill wind farm atherton tablelands queensland as of october 2010 around 22.9 of australias renewable electricity and 2 of australias total electricity was sourced from wind power20 enough electricity to power more than 700,000 homes21 this came from 52 operating wind farms containing a total of 1,052turbines producing approximately 5,000gwh of electricity per year this figure represented approximately a 30 increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade or a total increase of more than 1,000 over that time the total installed capacity as of october 2010 was 1,880mw including only projects over 100kw with a further 1,043mw under construction21 wind power in south australia is a fast-growing industry as south australia is well suited for wind farms consequently more wind power is generated in south australia than any other australian state or territory as of october 2010 south australia had an installed capacity of 907mw from 435turbines accounting for close to 20 of that states electricity needs considerably ahead of victoria with 428mw from 267turbines and western australia with 202mw from 142turbines.21 by the end of 2011 wind power in south australia had risen to 26 of the states electricity generation edging out coal fired power for the first time with only 7.2 of australias population south australia had 54 of the nations installed wind power capacity22 adelaides a22billion desalination plant capable of providing 50 of the citys water needs is totally powered by renewable energy the waubra wind farm near ballarat victoria completed in 2009 was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere19 consisting of 128turbines spread over 173km221 and rated at 192mw however in terms of generating capacity lake bonney wind farm near millicent south australia was the largest with 239.5mw despite only having 99turbines these figures have since been surpassed by the macarthur wind farm at macarthur victoria which opened in 2013 with a capacity of 420mw.2123 solaredit main article solar power in australia see also feed-in tariffs in australia solar photovoltaicsedit solar photovoltaic pv technology generates electricity from sunlight and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications they first become mass-produced in 2000 when german environmentalists and eurosolar succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program24 the issue for the australian photovoltaics industry today is that there is enormous market potential built up through a natural competitiveness in australian research and development industry investment and government policy support however despite this the industry is not yet self-sustaining and advantages gained to date could be lost25 a 2004 market report suggested that a partnership between government and industry is necessary the pv industry cannot continue to actively invest in strategic industry development unless the australian government is also committed to the journey the industry  requires policy and program support to assist it in bridging the gap to mainstream commercial competitiveness25 two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the solar power station planned for north-western victoria and the development of new solar cells queensland solar and lighting is a major importer of chinese and european solar products for the brisbane region in queensland australia26 mildura solar concentrator power stationedit many projects have demonstrated the feasibility of solar power in australia and a large new solar power station in victoria is planned solar systems is to build the worlds most advanced27 photovoltaic pv heliostat solar concentrator power station in north-western victoria the 154mw a420million project will generate 270,000mwh per year enough for more than 45,000 homes it will aid in reducing salinity and create jobs during manufacture construction and operation it will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 400,000tonnes per year28 full commissioning is expected in 2013 with the first stage to be completed in 2010.29 the essential components of the power plant developed by solar systems over the past 16years are an ultra powerful solar module for use in concentrated sunlight a cooling system to keep solar cells operating at 60c to optimise the operation of the pv modules in a concentrated solar beam that can melt steel low cost high performance mirror concentrator systems a control system to manage the power station to deliver maximum reliability and output29 the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia with support from the australian greenhouse office30 technology developmentedit sliver cell tm photovoltaic technology uses just one tenth of the costly and limited supply of silicon used in conventional solar panels while matching power performance and efficiency31 professor andrew blakers director of the australian national university centre for sustainable energy systems invented the technology with colleague dr klaus weber and developed it with funding from energy supplier origin energy and the australian research council blakers and weber won the australian institute of physics walsh medal for their work32 origin energy is presently developing sliver modules for commercialisation at its a20m pilot plant in regency park south australia33 solar thermal energyedit main article solar thermal energy in australia australia has developed world leading solar thermal technologies but with only very low levels of actual use domestic solar water heating is the most common solar thermal technology34 solar water heatingedit main article solar hot water in australia during the 1950s australias commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro carried out world leading research into flat plate solar water heaters a solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies despite an excellent solar resource the penetration of solar water heaters in the australian domestic market was only about 5 in 2006 with new dwellings accounting for most sales35 by 2014 around 14 of australian households had solar hot water installed 36 it is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system it could reduce a familys co2 emissions up to 3tonnes per year while saving up to 80 of the energy costs for water heating37 while solar water heating saves a significant amount of energy they are generally omitted from measures of renewable energy production as they do not actually produce electricity based on the installed base in australia as of october 2010 it was calculated that solar hot water units would account for about 7.4 of clean energy production if they were included in the overall figures38 solar thermal poweredit white cliffs solar power station australias first solar power station operated between 1981 and 2004 csiros national solar energy centre in newcastle nsw houses a 500kw thermal and a 1.5 mw thermal solar central receiver system which are used as research and development facilities3940 the australian national university anu has worked on dish concentrator systems since the early 1970s and early work lead to the construction of the white cliffs solar thermal station in 1994 the first big dish 400m2 solar concentrator was completed on the anu campus in 2005 wizard power pty ltd was established to commercialise the big dish technology to deployment41 wizard power has built and demonstrated the 500m2 commercial big dish design in canberra and the whyalla solaroasis42 will be the first commercial implementation of the technology using 300 wizard power big dish solar thermal concentrators to deliver a 40mwe solar thermal power plant43 construction is expected to commence in mid-late 2013

project which should be running by early 2010.4445 in august 2008 worley parsons an australian engineering firm announced plans to build worlds biggest solar plant in australia within three years backed by nine australian companies including miners bhp billiton and rio tinto they have launched a study into finding possible sites to host the 1billion plant46 solar citiesedit solar cities in australia is a 75million program which is designed to demonstrate how solar power smart meters energy conservation and new approaches to electricity pricing can combine to provide a sustainable energy future in urban locations throughout australia it is a partnership approach that involves all levels of government the private sector and the local community adelaide townsville blacktown and alice springs are the first four solar cities announced in australia47 consumers will be able to purchase solar photovoltaic panels using discounted loans the project also plans to help low-income and rental households in the community share in the benefits of the project through other cost-saving initiatives48 geothermal energyedit main article geothermal energy in australia in australia geothermal energy is a natural resource which is not utilised as a form of energy however there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country in which geothermal activity is detectable exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal activity and such high levels were detected as a result projects will eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected at potential locations south australia has been described as australias hot rock haven and this emissions free and renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6.8 of australias base load power needs by 2030.49 according to an estimate by the centre for international economics australia has enough geothermal energy to contribute electricity for 450years.50 there are currently 19 companies australia-wide spending a654million in exploration programmes in 141 areas in south australia which is expected to dominate the sectors growth 12 companies have already applied for 116 areas and can be expected to invest a524million us435 m in their projects by the next six years ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows by 2010 with at least three power generation demonstration projects coming on stream by 2012.49 a geothermal power plant is generating 80kw of electricity at birdsville in southwest queensland51 wave poweredit main article wave power in australia several projects for harvesting the power of the ocean are under development ocean power technologies australasia pty ltd is developing a 19mw wave power station connected to the grid near portland victoria the project has received an au6646million grant from the federal government of australia oceanlinx is trialling a wave energy system at port kembla carnegie corp of western australia is refining a method of using energy captured from passing waves ceto to generate high-pressure sea water this is piped onshore to drive a turbine and to create desalinated water a series of large buoys is tethered to piston pumps anchored in waters 15 to 50 metres 49 to 164ft deep the rise and fall of passing waves drives the pumps generating water pressures of up to 1,000pounds per square inch psi the company is looking to have a 50 mw demonstration project finished within the next four years biopower systems is developing its biowave system anchored to the seabed that would generate electricity through the movement of buoyant blades as waves pass in a swaying motion similar to the way sea plants such as kelp move it expects to complete pilot wave and tidal projects off northern tasmania this year52 biofuelsedit main article biofuel in australia biofuels produced from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008 leading to increased concerns about food vs fuel ethanol fuel in australia can be produced from sugarcane or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of fuel ethanol in australia all on the east coast legislation imposes a 10 cap on the concentration of fuel ethanol blends blends of 90 unleaded petrol and 10 fuel ethanol are commonly referred to as e1053 which is mainly available through service stations operating under the bp caltex shell and united brands in partnership with the queensland government the canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in march 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry over 100million litres of the new bp unleaded with renewable ethanol has now been sold to queensland motorists53 biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol given the nations heavy reliance on road transport and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars54 australian cities are some of the most car-deponent cities in the world55 and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax56 biomassedit biomass can be used directly for electricity generation for example by burning sugar cane waste bagasse as a fuel for thermal power generation in sugar mills it can also be used to produce steam for industrial uses cooking and heating it can also be converted into a liquid or gaseous biofuel57 in 2015 bagasse accounted for 26.1 90.2pj of australias renewable energy consumption while wood and woodwaste for another 26.9 92.9pj.3 biomass for energy production was the subject of a federal government report in 2004.58 major renewable energy companiesedit bp solaredit bp has been involved in solar power since 1973 and its subsidiary bp solar is now one of the worlds largest solar power companies with production facilities in the united states spain india and australia59 bp solar is involved in the commercialisation

a third wind farm has reached financial close for wind prospect in south australia this is the 95 mw hallett wind farm which is expected to be fully commissioned late in 2008 government policyedit this article needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information april 2009 main articles energy policy of australia and solar credits there are a number of government policies in place in australia that influence the development of renewable energy mandatory renewable energy target mret schemesedit a key policy encouraging the development of renewable energy in australia includes mandatory renewable energy target mret schemes at both commonwealth and state levels in 2001 the howard government introduced an mret of 9,500 gwh of new renewable energy generation by 2010 this target has since been revised with the gillard government introducing in january 2011 an expanded target of 45,000 gwh of additional renewable energy between 2001 and 2020.72 this mret has been split into a small scale renewable energy scheme sres and large scale renewable energy target lret components to ensure that adequate incentive exists for large scale grid connected renewable energy73 a number of states have also implemented their own renewable energy targets independent of the commonwealth for example the victorian renewable energy target scheme vret mandated an additional 5 of victorias load for renewable generation although this has since been replaced by the new australian government lret and sres targets73 south australia achieved its target of 20 of renewable supply by 2014 three years ahead of schedule ie in 2011 and has subsequently established a new target of 33 to be achieved by 2020.74 renewable energy certificates registryedit the renewable energy certificates registry rec-registry is an internet based registry system that is required by the australian renewable energy electricity act 2000 the act75 the rec-registry is dedicated to maintaining various registers as set in the act and facilitating the creation registration transfer and surrender of renewable energy certificates recs carbon pricingedit main article carbon pricing in australia in 2012 the gillard government implemented a carbon price of 23 per tonne to be paid by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in australia the carbon price will increase to 25.40 per tonne by 201415 and then will be set by the market from 1 july 2015 onwards76 it is expected that in addition to encouraging efficient use of electricity pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050.77 analysis of the first 6months of operation of the carbon tax have shown that there has been a drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector it has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power78 the government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working78 the carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the tony abbott-led australian government on 17 july 2014.79 since then carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased80 clean energy finance corporationedit main article clean energy finance corporation the australian government has announced the creation of the new 10billion dollar clean energy finance corporation which will commence business in july 2013 the goal of this intervention is to overcome barriers to the mobilisation of capital by the renewable energy sector it will make available two billion dollars a year for five years for the financing of renewable energy energy efficiency and low emissions technologies projects in the latter stages of development the government has indicated that the fund is expected to be financially self-sufficient producing a positive return on investment comparable to the long term bond rate1081 feed-in tariffsedit main article feed-in tariffs in australia feed-in tariffs have been enacted on a state by state basis in australia to encourage investment in renewable energy by providing above commercial rates for electricity generated from sources such as rooftop photovoltaic panels or wind turbines7 the schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind farms feed-in tariffs schemes in australia started at a premium but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate7 all the schemes now in place in australia are net schemes whereby the householder is only paid for surplus electricity over and above what is actually used in the past new south wales and the australian capital territory enacted gross schemes whereby householders were entitled to be paid for 100 of renewable electricity generated on the premises however these programs have now expired in 2008 the council of australian governments coag agreed to harmonise the various state schemes and developed a set of national principles to apply to new schemes82 leader of the australian greens christine milne has advocated a uniform national gross feed-in tariff scheme however this proposal has not been enacted83 subsidies to fossil fuel industryedit there is dispute about the level of subsidies paid to the fossil fuel industry in australia the australian conservation foundation acf argues that according to the definitions of the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in australia by means of direct payments favourable tax treatment and other actions it is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources84 analysis by the acf indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of a77billion with the most significant component being the fuel tax credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users85 this analysis is disputed by the institute of public affairs ipa who argue that the acfs definition of a subsidy differs from that of the oecd and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view however the ipa acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the acf analysis some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence86 ratification of the kyoto protocoledit australia ratified the kyoto protocol in december 2007 under the then newly elected prime minister kevin rudd evidence suggests australia will meet its targets required under this protocol australia had not ratified the kyoto protocol until then due to concerns over a loss of competitiveness with the us which also rejects the treaty87 public opinion and actionedit demonstration in front of the parliament house melbourne supporting investment in renewable energy survey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in australia in one recent survey 74 of respondents favoured a greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy and 19 favoured an approach that focuses mainly on nuclear power and clean coal technologies88 the australian results from the 1st annual world environment review based on a survey of 1,007 people in 2007 found that89 88 of australians think that the government should do more to increase the use of solar power 78 say the government should do more to boost wind power 58 hydro power 50 tidal power and 38 geothermal power while only 25 think that the government should do more to increase use of nuclear power 84 of australians think that the government should make it easier for people to buy renewable electricity 89 think that all electricity should contain a minimum 25 of power generated from renewable energy sources only 3 disagree 82 think that the government should make it easier for people to buy solar panels 80 think that the government should make it easier for people to buy energy efficient products such as energy-saving light globes water-saving shower heads and insulation etc 85 think that the government should raise national fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks 87 think that the government should do more to increase the number of cars that dont use petrol there is a considerable movement known as the transition decade to transition australias entire energy system to renewable by 2020 voluntary uptake of greenpower a government program initiated in 1997 whereby people can pay extra for electricity that is generated from renewable sources increased from 132,300 customers in 2005 to 904,716 customers in 2009.90 future prospectsedit the percentage of renewable resources that could be achieved by 2020 has evolved from 25 in 2007 to 100 in 2010 2007 several reports have discussed the possibility of australia setting a renewable energy target of 25 by 2020.9192 combined with some basic energy efficiency measures such a target could deliver 15,000mw new renewable power capacity 33billion in new investment 16,600 new jobs and 69million tonnes reduction in electricity sector greenhouse gas emissions92 2008 greenpeace released a report in 2008 called energy revolution a sustainable energy australia outlook detailing how australia could produce 40 of its energy through renewable energy by 2020 and completely phase out coal-fired power by 2030 without any job losses93 david spratt and phillip sutton argue in their book climate code red that australia as part of a concerted global effort needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as quickly as possible so that carbon dioxide can be drawn down from the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to less than 325ppm co2-e which they argue is the upper safe climate level at which we can continue developing infinitely they outline a plan of action which would accomplish this94 2010 australia could entirely transition to renewable energy within the 2010decade by building 12 very large scale solar power plants 3500 mw each which would provide 60 of electricity used and 6500 7.5 mw wind turbines which would supply most of the remaining 40 along with other changes according to the zero carbon australia stationary energy plan95 for a cost of a370billion about 8householdweek over a decade to create an infrastructure that will last a minimum of 30 to 40years biofuel use is proposed to increase from 2 pj used in 2010 to 51 pjyear for modes of transportation not easily electrified along with some hybrid vehicles96 the cost of oil post peak oil is increasing and without converting now to 100 renewable sources the world will pay an additional usd8trillion over the next 25years and then convert to 100 renewable97 recently an uptake of third party ownership models for small to mid-scale solar photovoltaic systems has been seen in australia mirroring developments in the same direction in the us with over 70 of all new pv systems installed under such models in california colorado and arizona98 in australia the solar power purchase agreement approach is pursued under the term solar sponsoring99 2015 the australian federal government ordered100 the 10billion clean energy finance corporation101 to refrain from any new investment in wind power projects with the
