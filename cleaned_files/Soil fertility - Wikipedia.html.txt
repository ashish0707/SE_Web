soil fertility refers ability soil sustain agricultural plant growth provide plant habitat result sustained consistent yields high quality1 fertile soil properties2 ability supply essential plant nutrients soil water adequate amounts proportions plant growth reproduction absence toxic substances inhibit plant growth properties contribute soil fertility situations sufficient soil depth adequate root growth water retention good internal drainage allowing sufficient aeration optimal root growth plants rice tolerate waterlogging topsoil sufficient soil organic matter healthy soil structure soil moisture retention soil ph range 5.5 7.0 suitable plants prefer tolerate acid alkaline conditions adequate concentrations essential plant nutrients plant-available forms presence range microorganisms
