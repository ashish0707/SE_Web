wind farm in neuenkirchen erection of an enercon e70-4 in germany wind power in germany describes wind power in germany as part of energy in germany and renewable energy in germany in 2011 the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 29,075 megawatts mw with wind power producing about 7.7 percent of germanys total electrical power1 according to ewea in a normal wind year installed wind capacity in germany will meet 10.6 at end 2011 and 9.3 at end 2010 of the german electricity needs23 the persistent disparity between ewea estimates for a normal wind year and the actual data tabulated below is due to the ewea relying on an unrealistically high capacity factor for german wind productioncitation needed more than 21,607 wind turbines are located in the german federal area and the country has plans to build more wind turbines45 as of 2011 germanys federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization6 with a particular focus on offshore wind farms7 a major challenge will be the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern

electricity generation development investments capacity employment and the public opinion 9 as of 2010 wind power in germany provides over 96,100 people with jobs and german wind energy systems are also exported410 the fuhrlnder wind turbine laasow built in 2006 near the village of laasow brandenburg was the tallest wind turbine in the world for six years in germany hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of germanys electricity11 wind power has gained very high social acceptance in germany12 in 2016 germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017.13 repoweringedit repowering the replacement of first-generation wind turbines with modern multi-megawatt machines is occurring in germany modern turbines make better use of available wind energy and so more wind power can come from the same area of land modern turbines also offer much better grid integration since they use a connection method similar to conventional power plants1415 offshore wind

offshore wind energy also has great potential in germany16 wind speed at sea is 70 to 100 higher than onshore and much more constant a new generation of 5mw or larger wind turbines which are capable of making full use of the potential of wind power at sea has already been developed and prototypes are available this makes it possible to operate offshore wind farms in a cost-effective way once the usual initial difficulties of new technologies have been overcome17 on 15 july 2009 the first offshore german windturbine completed construction this turbine is the first of a total of 12 wind turbines for the alpha ventus offshore wind farm in the north sea18 following the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents germanys federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization with a particular focus on offshore wind farms19 under the plan large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land and where the enormous turbines wont bother the inhabitants the plan aims to decrease germanys dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants7 the german government wants to see 7.6gw installed by 2020 and as much as 26gw by 2030.20 a major challenge will be the lack of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany8 in 2014 all in all 410 turbines with 1747 megawatts were added to germanys offshore windparks due to not yet finished grid-connections only turbines with combined 528.9 megawatts were added to the grid feed at the end of 2014 despite this the gigawatt offshore windpower barrier has been breached by germany at the end of 2014.21 energy transitionedit main article energy transition in germany the 2010 energiewende policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power germanys share of renewables has increased from around 5 in 1999 to 17 in 2010 reaching close to the oecd average of 18 usage of renewables22 producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years guaranteeing a fixed income energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market nuclear power plants were closed and the existing 9 plants will close earlier than necessary in 2022 the reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has so far had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels and on electricity imports from france however in good wind germany exports to france in january 2015 the average price was 29mwh in germany and 39mwh in france23 one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure sdlink to bring the power to market2224 the transmission constraint sometimes causes germany to pay danish wind power to stop producing in octobernovember 2015 this amounted to 96 gwh costing 1.8 million euros25 different lnder have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers who have had rising electricity bills germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe26 statisticsedit annual wind power in germany 1990-2015 shown in a semi-log plot with installed capacity mw in red and power
