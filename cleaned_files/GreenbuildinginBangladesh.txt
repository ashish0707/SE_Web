in the world its rising population and limited land space have put tremendous strains on the urban ecosystem the capital of dhaka itself underwent severe transformations in recent years to catch up the increased rate of urbanization this change was paralleled by a boom in the real estate construction and housing industry according to united nations population fund unfpa dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world1 unified measures have been adopted from the national community in an effort to avoid further man made calamities due to climate change and higher emissions there are six main sectors most likely to be affected by climate change in bangladesh - water resources and coastal zones infrastructure and human settlements agriculture and food security forestry and biodiversity fisheries and human health2 deforestation has resulted in several man made disasters in the countrys history green buildings assure efficient usage of water and energy and the nation is struggling in the production of electricity and suffering from a shortage of water contents 1 background 2 see also 3 sources 4 further reading 5 external links backgroundedit the first green building in bangladesh was by epic group in may 2011.3 since 2008 sustainable built environment initiative - bangladesh later bangladesh green building council founder sanwar azam had worked to unify the stake holders towards a greener country saying that with growing population in a diminishing land and rapid urbanization to major cities going green had become a marketing ploy for various organizations as there were no quantifiable way to judge a structures sustainability4 he offered a centralized board to offer leadership in energy and environmental design leed certifications to interested projects and firms5 in addition he proposed a similar voluntary building rating tool that is much cheaper to attain and one that is much suited to the socio-economic conditions of the country and relevant to its building environment and construction culture6 azam also stressed the need for educational programs in sustainable designs and various universities in bangladesh planned to promote green building principles in their curriculum such as in the bangladesh university of engineering and technology american international university-bangladesh north south university brac university and asia pacific university5 dr saleh uddin was the events and education committee of bangladesh green building council citing that in cramped environment such buildings and structures would be far more comfortable and satisfying but most importantly directly address some national issues like conserving water and energy the government of bangladesh in 2009 stopped giving connections to newly constructed buildings meaning that new homes would not have access to energy and even water due to shortages7 experts agreed that a rating tool would not only facilitate government incentives to sustainable communities but achieve the six point goals of the national water policy of 1999 by the world bank as well as the renewable energy policy of 2008 by the ministry of power and energy5 in an event with architecture and construction experts he urged for a national need for sustainable development in the nations growing building industry and brought a forum together to act as the national gbc of

stakeholders while united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc and intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fellows commented on the global imperative of such an initiative8 the first proposed rating tool aimed to fulfill the seventh target from the united nations millennium development goals mdgs as for the first time the council provided support for green building certifications9 initially with minimal government support the plan was to transform the market with cost effective steps in another interview with the the independent sanwar said there is a great misconception regarding the cost effectiveness of the green design and construction and that increased productivity and energy savings of a green building outweighs initial costs about the feasibility of widespread utilization of leed certifications he said that it is very expensive and the bangladesh is in the process of developing a green building rating system in the regional context10 these activities were also promoted by national and region experts prominent national award winning architects such as mustapha khalid palash the 2010 holcim green built sustainable design competition

architecture community in the form of the bgbc rating tool12 in 2011 bgbc founder pointed out that such green building standards and tools will lead to conservation as buildings would less consumption of electricity and water5 and also the need for reduction of carbon emissions in the current building and construction scenario at the same meeting the additional chief architect of the ministry of
