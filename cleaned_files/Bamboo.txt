worldwide distribution of bamboos most bamboo are native to warm and moist tropical and warm temperate climates however many species are found in diverse climates from hot tropical regions to cool mountainous regions and highland cloud forests in the asia-pacific region they occur across east asia from 50n latitude in sakhalin11 south to northern australia and west to india and the himalayas china japan korea india and australia all have several endemic populations 12 they also occur in small numbers in sub-saharan africa confined to tropical areas from southern senegal in the north to southern mozambique and madagascar in the south13 in the americas bamboo has a native range from 47 s in southern argentina and the beech forests of central chile through the south american tropical rainforests to the andes in ecuador near 14,000 feet bamboo is also native through central america and mexico northward into the southeastern united states 14 canada russia and continental europe is not known to have any native species of bamboo15 recently some attempts have been made to grow bamboo on a commercial basis in the great lakes region of east-central africa especially in rwanda16 in

national park brazil bamboo canopy bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants on earth with reported growth rates up to 91cm 36in in 24 hours4 however the growth rate is dependent on local soil and climatic conditions as well as species and a more typical growth rate for many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates is in the range of 310cm 1.23.9in per day during the growing period primarily growing in regions of warmer climates during the late cretaceous period vast fields existed in what is now asia some of the largest timber bamboo can grow over 30m 98ft tall and be as large as 2530cm 9.811.8in in diameter however the size range for mature bamboo is species-dependent with the smallest bamboos reaching only several inches high at maturity a typical height range that would cover many of the common bamboos grown in the united states is 4.612m 1539ft depending on species anji county of china known as the town of bamboo provides the optimal climate and soil conditions to grow harvest and process some of the most valued bamboo poles available worldwide unlike all trees individual bamboo culms emerge from the ground at their full diameter and grow to their full height in a single growing season of three to four months during this time each new shoot grows vertically into a culm with no branching out until the majority of the mature height is reached then the branches extend from the nodes and leafing out occurs in the next year the pulpy wall of each culm slowly hardens during the third year the culm hardens further the shoot is now a fully mature culm over the next 25 years depending on species fungus begins to form on the outside of the culm which eventually penetrates and overcomes the culmcitation needed around 58 years later species- and climate-dependent the fungal growths cause the culm to collapse and decay this brief life means culms are ready for harvest and suitable for use in construction within about three to seven years individual bamboo culms do not get any taller or larger in diameter in subsequent years than they do in their first year and they do not replace any growth lost from pruning or natural breakage bamboo has a wide range of hardiness depending on species and locale small or young specimens of an individual species produce small culms initially as the clump and its rhizome system mature taller and larger culms are produced each year until the plant approaches its particular species limits of height and diameter many tropical bamboo species die at or near freezing temperatures while some of the hardier temperate bamboos can survive temperatures as low as 29c 20f some of the hardiest bamboo species can be grown inusda plant hardiness zones 5 although they typically defoliate and may even lose all above-ground growth yet the rhizomes survive and send up shoots again the next spring in milder climates such as usda zone 7 and above most bamboo remain fully leafed out and green year-round mass floweringedit further information bamboo blossom flowering bamboo phyllostachys glauca yunzhu in flower most bamboo species flower infrequently in fact many only flower at intervals as long as 65 or 120 years these taxa exhibit mass flowering or gregarious flowering with all plants in a particular cohort flowering over a several-year period any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will also flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location the longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years and it is for the species phyllostachys bambusoides sieb zucc in this species all plants of the same stock flower at the same time regardless of differences in geographic locations or climatic conditions and then the bamboo dies the lack of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some sort of alarm clock in each cell of the plant which signals the diversion of all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative growth18 this mechanism as well as the evolutionary cause behind it is still largely a mystery one hypothesis to explain the evolution of this semelparous mass flowering is the predator satiation hypothesis which argues that by fruiting at the same time a population increases the survival rate of its seeds by flooding the area with fruit so even if predators eat their fill seeds will still be left over by having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent predators bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation during the period between flowering events thus the death of the adult clone is due to resource exhaustion as it would be more effective for parent plants to devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back energy for their own regeneration19 another the fire cycle hypothesis states that periodic flowering followed by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create disturbance in the habitat thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which to grow this argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load and also a large target for lightning strikes increasing the likelihood of wildfire20 because bamboos can be aggressive as early successional plants the seedlings would be able to outstrip other plants and take over the space left by their parents however both have been disputed for different reasons the predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents something not predicted the bamboo fire cycle hypothesis is considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable they argue21 that fires only result from humans and there is no natural fire in india this notion is considered wrong based on distribution of lightning strike data during the dry season throughout india however another argument against this is the lack of precedent for any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural evolutionary progress22 more recently a mathematical explanation for the extreme length of the flowering cycles has been offered involving both the stabilizing selection implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others and the fact that plants that flower at longer intervals tend to release more seeds2324 the hypothesis claims that bamboo flowering intervals grew by integer multiplication a mutant bamboo plant flowering at a noninteger multiple of its populations flowering interval would release its seeds alone and would not enjoy the benefits of collective flowering such as protection from predators however a mutant bamboo plant flowering at an integer multiple of its populations flowering interval would release its seeds only during collective flowering events and would release more seeds than the average plant in the population it could therefore take over the population establishing a flowering interval that is an integer multiple of the previous flowering interval the hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo flowering intervals should factorize into small prime numbers the mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences however the huge increase in available fruit in the forests often causes a boom in rodent populations leading to increases in disease and famine in nearby human populations for example devastating consequences occur when the melocanna bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 3035 years25 around the bay of bengal the death of the bamboo plants following their fruiting means the local people lose their building material and the large increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations as the number of rodents increases they consume all available food including grain fields and stored food sometimes leading to famine these rats can also carry dangerous diseases such as typhus typhoid and bubonic plague which can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number1819 the relationship between rat populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a 2009 nova documentary rat attack in any case flowering produces masses of seeds typically suspended from the ends of the branches these seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the flowering or they may produce new cultivars with different characteristics such as the presence or absence of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically flowering has been reported bambusa vulgaris bambusa balcooa and dendrocalamus stocksii are common examples of such bamboo26

challenged and removed june 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message bamboo used for construction purposes must be harvested when the culms reach their greatest strength and when sugar levels in the sap are at their lowest as high sugar content increases the ease and rate of pest infestation harvesting of bamboo is typically undertaken according to these cycles 1 lifecycle of the culm as each individual culm goes through a 5 to 7-year lifecycle culms are ideally allowed to reach this level of maturity prior to full capacity harvesting the clearing out or thinning of culms particularly older decaying culms helps to ensure adequate light and resources for new growth well-maintained clumps may have a productivity three to four times that of an unharvested wild clump consistent with the lifecycle described above bamboo is harvested from two to three years through to five to seven years depending on the species 2 annual cycle as all growth of new bamboo occurs during the wet season disturbing the clump during this phase will potentially damage the upcoming crop also during this high-rainfall period sap levels are at their highest and then diminish towards the dry season picking immediately prior to the wetgrowth season may also damage new shoots hence harvesting is best a few months prior to the start of the wet season 3 daily cycle during the height of the day photosynthesis is at its peak producing the highest levels of sugar in sap making this the least ideal time of day to harvest many traditional practitioners believe the best time to harvest is at dawn or dusk on a waning moon leachingedit leaching is the removal of sap after harvest in many areas of the world the sap levels in harvested bamboo are reduced either through leaching or postharvest photosynthesis examples of this practice include cut bamboo is raised clear of the ground and leaned against the rest of the clump for one to two weeks until leaves turn yellow to allow full consumption of sugars by the plant a similar method is undertaken but with the base of the culm standing in fresh water either in a large drum or stream to leach out sap cut culms are immersed in a running stream and weighted down for three to four weeks water is pumped through the freshly cut culms forcing out the sap this method is often used in conjunction with the injection of some form of treatment in the process of water leaching the bamboo is dried slowly and evenly in the shade to avoid cracking in the outer skin of the bamboo thereby reducing opportunities for pest infestation durability of bamboo in construction is directly related to how well it is handled from the moment of planting through harvesting transportation storage design construction and maintenance bamboo harvested at the correct time of year and then exposed to ground contact or rain will break down just as quickly as incorrectly harvested material27 ornamental bamboosedit the two general patterns for the growth of bamboo are clumping sympodial and running monopodial clumping bamboo species tend to spread slowly as the growth pattern of the rhizomes is to simply expand the root mass gradually similar to ornamental grasses running bamboos though need to be controlled during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive behavior they spread mainly through their roots andor rhizomes which can spread widely underground and send up new culms to break through the surface running bamboo species are highly variable in their tendency to spread this is related to both the species and the soil and climate conditions some can send out runners of several metres a year while others can stay in the same general area for long periods if neglected over time they can cause problems by moving into adjacent areas bamboos seldom and unpredictably flower and the frequency of flowering varies greatly from species to species once flowering takes place a plant declines and often dies entirely although a few species of bamboo are always in flower at any given time collectors desiring to grow specific bamboo typically obtain their plants as divisions of already-growing plants rather than waiting for seeds to be produced regular observations indicate major growth directions and locations once the rhizomes are cut they are typically removed however rhizomes take a number of months to mature and an immature severed rhizome usually ceases growing if left in-ground if any bamboo shoots come up outside of the bamboo area afterwards their presence indicates the precise location of the removed rhizome the fibrous roots that radiate from the rhizomes do not produce more bamboo bamboo growth is also controlled by surrounding the plant or grove with a physical barrier typically concrete and specially rolled hdpe plastic are the materials used to create the barrier which is placed in a 60 to 90-cm-deep ditch around the planting and angled out at the top to direct the rhizomes to the surface this is only possible if the barrier is installed in a straight line if the containment area is small this method can be detrimental to ornamental bamboo as the bamboo within can become rootbound and start to display the signs of any unhealthy containerized plant in addition rhizomes can escape over the top or beneath the barrier if it is not deep enough strong rhizomes and tools can penetrate plastic barriers so care must be taken in small areas regular maintenance may be the best method for controlling the running bamboos barriers and edging are unnecessary for clump-forming bamboos although these may eventually need to have portions removed if they become too large the ornamental plant sold in containers and marketed as lucky bamboo is actually an entirely unrelated
