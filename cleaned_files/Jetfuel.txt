gas-turbine engines it is colorless to straw-colored in appearance the most commonly used fuels for commercial aviation are jet a and jet a-1 which are produced to a standardized international specification the only other jet fuel commonly used in civilian turbine-engine powered aviation is jet b which is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons the range of their sizes molecular weights or carbon numbers is defined by the requirements for the product such as the freezing or smoke point kerosene-type jet fuel

aircraft usually a high-octane gasoline known as avgas has a low flash point to improve its ignition characteristics turbine engines can operate with a wide range of fuels and jet-aircraft engines typically use fuels with higher flash points which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle the first axial compressor jet engine in widespread production and combat service the junkers jumo 004 used on the messerschmitt me 262a fighter and the arado ar 234b jet recon-bomber burned either a special synthetic j2 fuel or diesel fuel gasoline was a third option but unattractive due to high fuel consumption2 other fuels used were kerosene or kerosene and gasoline mixtures most jet fuels in use since the end of world war ii are kerosene-based both british and american standards for jet fuels were first established at the end of world war ii british standards derived from standards for kerosene use for lampsknown as paraffin in the ukwhereas american standards derived from aviation gasoline practices over the subsequent years details of specifications were adjusted such as minimum freezing point to balance performance requirements and availability of fuels very low temperature freezing points reduce the availability of fuel higher flash point products required for use on aircraft carriers are more expensive to produce3 in the united states astm international produces standards for civilian fuel types and the us department of defense produces standards for military use the british ministry of defence establishes standards for both civil and military jet fuels3 for reasons of inter-operational ability british and united states military standards are harmonized to a degree in russia and former soviet union countries grades of jet fuels are

region that is used for its enhanced cold-weather performance however jet bs lighter composition makes it more dangerous to handle7 for this reason it is rarely used except in very cold climates a blend of approximately 30 kerosene and 70 gasoline it is known as wide-cut fuel it has a very low freezing point of 60c 76f and a low flash point as well it is primarily used in some military aircraft it is also used in canada alaska and sometimes russia because of its low freezing point additivesedit the def stan 91-91 uk and astm d1655 international specifications allow for certain additives to be added to jet fuel including1213 antioxidants to prevent gumming usually based on alkylated phenols eg ao-30 ao-31 or ao-37 antistatic agents to dissipate static electricity and prevent sparking stadis 450 with dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid dinnsa as a component is an example corrosion inhibitors eg dci-4a used for civilian and military fuels and dci-6a used for military fuels fuel system icing inhibitor fsii agents eg di-egme fsii is often mixed at the point-of-sale so that users with heated fuel lines do not have to pay the extra expense biocides are to remediate microbial ie bacterial and fungal growth present in aircraft fuel systems currently two biocides are approved for use by most aircraft and turbine engine original equipment manufacturers oems kathon fp15 microbiocide and biobor jf14 metal deactivator can be added to remediate the deleterious effects of trace metals on the thermal stability of the fuel the one allowable additive is nn-disalicylidene 1,2-propanediamine as the aviation industrys jet kerosene demands have increased to more than 5 of all refined products derived from crude it has been necessary for the refiner to optimize the yield of jet kerosene a high value product by varying process techniques new processes have allowed flexibility in the choice of crudes the use of coal tar sands as a source of molecules and the manufacture of synthetic blend stocks due to the number and severity of the processes used it is often necessary and sometimes mandatory to use additives these additives may for example prevent the formation of harmful chemical species or improve a property of a fuel to prevent further engine wear water in jet fueledit it is very important that jet fuel be free from water contamination during flight the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere this causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel the separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank because it is denser than the fuel since the water is no longer in solution it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0c if these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes15 this was the cause of the british airways flight 38 accident removing all water from fuel is impractical therefore fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing there are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel a visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance an industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30ppm parts per million free water16 a critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is astm standard d3948 standard test method for determining water separation characteristics of aviation turbine fuels by portable separometer military jet fuelsedit machinists mate 3rd class inspects a sample of jp-5 jet fuel aboard an amphibious transport dock ship military organizations around the world use a different classification system of jp for jet propellant numbers some are almost identical to their civilian counterparts and differ only by the amounts of a few additives jet a-1 is similar to jp-8 jet b is similar to jp-417 other military fuels are highly specialized products and are developed for very specific applications jet fuels are sometimes classified as kerosene or naphtha-type3 kerosene-type fuels include jet a jet a-1 jp-5 and jp-8 naphtha-type jet fuels sometimes referred to as wide-cut jet fuel include jet b and jp-43 jp-1 was an early jet fuel18 specified in 1944 by the united states government an-f-32 it was a pure kerosene fuel with high flash point relative to aviation gasoline and a freezing point of 60c 76f the low freezing point requirement limited availability of the fuel and it was soon superseded by other wide cut jet fuels which were kerosene-naphtha or kerosene-gasoline blends it was also known as avtur jp-2 and jp-3 are obsolete types developed during world war ii jp-2 was intended to be easier to produce than jp-1 since it had a higher freezing point but was never widely used jp-3 was even more volatile than jp-2 and intended to improve production but its volatility led to high evaporation loss in service19 jp-4 was a 50-50 kerosene-gasoline blend it had lower flash point than jp-1 but was preferred because of its greater availability it was the primary united states air force jet fuel between 1951 and 1995 its nato code is f-40 it is also known as avtag jp-5 is a yellow kerosene-based jet fuel developed in 1952 for use in aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers where the risk from fire is particularly great jp-5 is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons containing alkanes naphthenes and aromatic hydrocarbons that weighs 6.8 pounds per us gallon 0.81kgl and has a high flash point min 60c or 140f.20 because some us naval air stations marine corps air stations and coast guard air stations host both sea-based and shore-based eg land based naval aircraft these installations will also typically fuel their shore-based aircraft with jp-5 thus precluding the need to maintain separate fuel facilities for jp-5 and non-jp-5 fuel in addition jp-5 may well have been used by other countries for their military aircraft its freezing point is 46c 51f it does not contain antistatic agents jp5 is also known as nci-c54784 jp-5s nato code is f-44 it is also called avcat fuel for aviation carrier turbine fuel21 the jp-4 and jp-5 fuels

working with the usaf to develop a synthetic jet fuel blend that will help them reduce their dependence on imported petroleum the usaf which is the united states militarys largest user of fuel began exploring alternative fuel sources in 1999 on december 15 2006 a b-52 took off from edwards air force base for the first time powered solely by a 50-50 blend of jp-8 and syntroleums ft fuel the seven-hour flight test was considered a success the goal of the flight test program was to qualify the fuel blend for fleet use on the services b-52s and then flight test and qualification on other aircraft piston engine useedit this section may be confusing or unclear to readers july 2014 learn how and when to remove this template message jet fuel is very similar to diesel fuel and in some cases may be burned in diesel engines the possibility of environmental legislation banning the use of leaded avgas and the lack of a replacement fuel with similar performance has left aircraft designers and pilots organizations searching for alternative engines for use in small aircraft26 as a result a few aircraft engine manufacturers most notably thielert and austro engine have begun offering aircraft diesel engines which run on jet fuel this technology has potential to simplify airport logistics by reducing the number of fuel types required jet fuel is available in most places in the world whereas avgas is only widely available in a few countries which have a large number of general aviation aircraft a diesel engine may also potentially be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than an avgas engine however very few diesel aircraft engines have been certified by aviation authorities diesel aircraft engines are uncommon today even though opposed-piston aviation diesel powerplants such as the junkers jumo 205 family had been used during the second world war jet fuel is often used in ground support vehicles at airports instead of diesel the united states military makes heavy use of jp-8 for instance however jet fuel tends to have poor lubricating ability in comparison to diesel thereby increasing wear on fuel pumps and other related engine partscitation needed civilian vehicles tend to disallow its use or require that an additive be mixed with the jet fuel to restore its lubricity jet fuel is more expensive than diesel fuel but the logistical advantages of using one fuel can offset the extra expense of its use in certain circumstances jet fuel contains more sulfur up to 1,000ppm which therefore means it is more lubricative and does not currently require a lubricity additive as all pipeline diesel fuels require the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel or ulsd brought with it the need for lubricity modifiers pipeline diesels before ulsd were able to contain up to 500ppm of sulfur and was called low sulfur diesel or lsd lsd is now only available to the off-road construction locative and marine markets as more epa regulations are introduced more refineries are hydrotreating their jet fuel production thus limiting the lubricating abilities of jet fuel as determined by astm standard d445 synthetic jet fueledit

synthetic jet fuel was from lanseria international airport to cape town international airport on september 22 2010 the fuel was developed by sasol34 chemist heather willauer is leading a team of researchers at the us naval research laboratory who are developing a process to make jet fuel from seawater the technology requires an input of electrical energy to separate carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 gas from seawater using an iron-based catalyst followed by an oligomerization step wherein carbon monoxide co and hydrogen are recombined into long-chain hydrocarbons using zeolite as the catalyst the technology is expected to be deployed in the 2020s by us navy warships especially nuclear-powered aircraft carriers353637383940 usaf synthetic fuel trialsedit on august 8 2007 air force
