zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres 900mi east of australia across the tasman sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres 600mi south of the pacific island areas of new caledonia fiji and tonga because of its remoteness it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans during its long period of isolation new zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal fungal and plant life the countrys varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks such as the southern alps owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions new zealands capital city is wellington while its most populous city is auckland sometime between 1250 and 1300 ce polynesians settled in the islands that would later become new zealand and developed a distinctive mori culture in 1642 abel tasman a dutch explorer became the first european to sight new zealand11 in 1840 representatives of the british crown and mori chiefs signed the treaty of waitangi making new zealand a british colony today the majority of new zealands population of 4.7 million is of european descent the indigenous mori are the largest minority followed by asians and pacific islanders reflecting this new zealands culture is mainly derived from mori and early british settlers with recent broadening arising from increased immigration the official languages are english mori and new zealand sign language with english predominant

james cook subsequently anglicised the name to new zealandn 7 aotearoa often translated as land of the long white cloud15 is the current mori name for new zealand it is unknown whether mori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of europeans with aotearoa originally referring to just the north island16 mori had several traditional names for the two main islands including te ika-a-mui the fish of mui for the north island and te waipounamu the waters of greenstone or te waka o aoraki the canoe of aoraki for the south island17 early european maps labelled the islands north north island middle south island and south stewart island rakiura18 in 1830 maps began to use north and south to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm19 the new zealand geographic board discovered in 2009 that the names of the north island and south island had never been formalised and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 this set the names as north island or te ika-a-mui and south island or te waipounamu20 note that for each island either its english or mori name can be used or both can be used together history main article history of new zealand the mori people are most likely descended from people who emigrated from taiwan to melanesia and then travelled east through to the society islands after a pause of 70 to 265 years a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of new zealand21 new zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans radiocarbon dating evidence of deforestation22 and mitochondrial dna variability within mori populations23 suggest new zealand was first settled by eastern polynesians between 1250 and 1300,1724 concluding a long series of voyages through the southern pacific islands25 over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as mori the population was divided into iwi tribes and hap subtribes who would sometimes cooperate sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other at some point a group of mori migrated to the chatham islands which they named rkohu where they developed their distinct moriori culture2627 the moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 largely because of taranaki mori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s although european diseases also contributed in 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded moriori died in 1933.28 the first europeans known to have reached new zealand were dutch explorer abel tasman and his crew in 1642.29 in a hostile encounter four crew members were killed and at least one mori was hit by canister shot30 europeans did not revisit new zealand until 1769 when british explorer james cook mapped almost the entire coastline29 following cook new zealand was visited by numerous european and north american whaling sealing and trading ships they traded european food metal tools weapons and other goods for timber mori food artifacts and water31 the introduction of the potato and the musket transformed mori agriculture and warfare potatoes provided a reliable food surplus which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns32 the resulting intertribal musket wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 killing 30,00040,000 mori33 from the early 19th century christian missionaries began to settle new zealand eventually converting most of the mori population34 the mori population declined to around 40 of its pre-contact level during the 19th century introduced diseases were the major factor35 the waitangi sheet from the treaty of waitangi in 1788 captain arthur phillip assumed the position of governor of the new british colony of new south wales which according to his commission included new zealand36 the british government appointed james busby as british resident to new zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern mori37 in 1835 following an announcement of impending french settlement by charles de thierry the nebulous united tribes of new zealand sent a declaration of the independence to king william iv of the united kingdom asking for protection37 ongoing unrest the proposed settlement of new zealand by the new zealand company which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from mori and the dubious legal standing of the declaration of independence prompted the colonial office to send captain william hobson to claim sovereignty for great britain and negotiate a treaty with the mori38 the treaty of waitangi was first signed in the bay of islands on 6 february 1840.39 in response to the new zealand companys attempts to establish an independent settlement in wellington40 and french settlers purchasing land in akaroa41 hobson declared british sovereignty over all of new zealand on 21 may 1840 even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for mori to sign42 with the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants particularly from the united kingdom began to increase43 a meeting of european and mori inhabitants of hawkes bay province engraving 1863 new zealand still part of the colony of new south wales became a separate colony of new zealand on 1 july 1841.44 the colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first parliament met in 1854.45 in 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy45 control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s45 following concerns that the south island might form a separate colony premier alfred domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from auckland to a locality near the cook strait46 wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865 as immigrant numbers increased conflicts over land led to the new zealand wars of the 1860s and 1870s resulting in the loss and confiscation of much mori land47 in 1891 the liberal party led by john ballance came to power as the first organised political party the liberal government later led by richard seddon passed many important social and economic measures in 1893 new zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote48 and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions49 in 1898 seddons government passed the old-age pensions act of 1898 the first general pensions scheme in the british empire in 1907 at the request of the new zealand parliament king edward vii proclaimed new zealand a dominion within the british empire reflecting its self-governing status accordingly the title dominion of new zealand dates from 1907.5051 in 1947 the country adopted the statute of westminster confirming that the british parliament could no longer legislate for new zealand without the consent of new zealand45 early in the 20th century new zealand was involved in world affairs fighting in the first and second world wars52 and suffering through the great depression53 the depression led to the election of the first labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy54 new zealand experienced increasing prosperity following world war ii55 and mori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work56 a mori protest movement developed which criticised eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of mori culture and the treaty of waitangi57 in 1975 a waitangi tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the treaty and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985.39 the government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi although mori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s politics main article politics of new zealand government elizabeth ii queen of new

consolidate railways education land sales and other policies government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.115 as a result new zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities the provinces are remembered in regional public holidays116 and sporting rivalries117 since 1876 various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government114118 in 1989 the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities119 the 249 municipalities119 that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils120 the regional councils role is to regulate the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management119 while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage water local roads building consents and other local matters121122 five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils122 the territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils 53 district councils and the chatham islands council while officially the chatham islands

along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres 250mi,136 with about 15,000km 9,300mi of coastline137 and a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres 103,500sqmi.138 because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline the country has extensive marine resources its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world covering more than 15 times its land area139 the south island is the largest landmass of new zealand and is divided along its length by the southern alps140 there are 18 peaks over 3,000 metres 9,800ft the highest of which is aoraki mount cook at 3,754 metres 12,316ft.141 fiordlands steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south-western corner of the south island142 the north island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism143 the highly active taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau punctuated by the north islands highest mountain mount ruapehu 2,797 metres 9,177ft the plateau also hosts the countrys largest lake lake taupo144 nestled in the caldera of one of the worlds most active supervolcanoes145 the country owes its varied topography and perhaps even its emergence above the waves to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the pacific and indo-australian plates146 new zealand is part of zealandia a microcontinent nearly half the size of australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the gondwanan supercontinent147 about 25 million years ago a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region this is now most evident in the southern alps formed by compression of the crust beside the alpine fault elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other producing the puysegur trench to the south the hikurangi trench east of the north island and the kermadec and tonga trenches148 further north146 new zealand and australia are both part of the wider regions known as

influenced evolution of the countrys species of animals fungi and plants physical isolation has not caused biological isolation and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species156157 about 82 of new zealands indigenous vascular plants are endemic covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family158159 the number of fungi recorded from new zealand including lichen-forming species is not known nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in new zealand158 and 40 of these are endemic160 the two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps or by southern beech in cooler climates161 the remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands the majority of which are tussock162 before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 of the land was covered in forest with only high alpine wet infertile and volcanic areas without trees163 massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived with around half the forest cover lost to fire after polynesian settlement164 much of the remaining forest fell after european settlement being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming leaving forest occupying only 23 of the land165 the extinct moa megalapteryx didinus the forests were dominated by birds and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi kakapo weka and takah evolving flightlessness166 the arrival of humans associated changes to habitat and the introduction of rats ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species including large birds like the moa and haasts eagle167168 other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles tuataras skinks and geckos169 frogs spiders katipo insects weta and snails170171 some such as the wrens and tuatara are so unique that

focussing at different times on sealing whaling flax gold kauri gum and native timber185 with the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to britain a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in new zealand186 high demand for agricultural products from the united kingdom and the united states helped new zealanders achieve higher living standards than both australia and western europe in the 1950s and 1960s.187 in 1973 new zealands export market was reduced when the united kingdom joined the european community188 and other compounding factors such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis led to a severe economic depression189 living standards in new zealand fell behind those of australia and western europe and by 1982 new
