a 1956 world oil production distribution showing historical data and future production proposed by m king hubbert it has a peak of 12.5 billion barrels per year in about the year 2000 hubberts upper-bound prediction for us crude oil production 1956 and actual lower-48 states production through 2014 peak oil an event based on m king hubberts theory is the point in time when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached after which it is expected to enter terminal decline1 peak oil theory is based on the observed rise peak fall and depletion of aggregate production rate in oil fields over time it is often confused with oil depletion however peak oil is the point of maximum production while depletion refers to a period of falling reserves and supply some observers such as petroleum industry experts kenneth s deffeyes and matthew simmons predict negative global economy implications following a post-peak production decline and subsequent oil price increase because of the high dependence of most modern industrial transport agricultural and industrial systems on the low cost and high availability of oil23 predictions vary greatly as to what exactly these negative effects would be oil production forecasts on which predictions of peak oil are based are often made within a range which includes optimistic higher production and pessimistic lower production scenarios optimistic4 estimations of peak production forecast the global decline will begin after 2020 and assume major investments in alternatives will occur before a crisis without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil-consuming nations pessimistic predictions of future oil production made after 2007 stated either that the peak had already occurred5678 that oil production was on the cusp of the peak or that it would occur shortly910 hubberts original prediction that us peak oil would be in about 1970 seemed accurate for a time as us average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9.6 million barrels per day11 however the successful application of massive hydraulic fracturing to additional tight reservoirs caused us production to rebound challenging the inevitability of post-peak decline for the us oil production12 in addition hubberts original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature4 contents 1 modeling global oil production 2 demand 2.1

the idea that the rate of oil production would peak and irreversibly decline is an old one in 1919 david white chief geologist of the united states geological survey wrote of us petroleum the peak of production will soon be passed possibly within 3 years13 in 1953 eugene ayers a researcher for gulf oil projected that if us ultimate recoverable oil reserves were 100 billion barrels then production in the us would peak no later than 1960 if ultimate recoverable were to be as high as 200 billion barrels which he warned was wishful thinking us peak production would come no later than 1970 likewise for the world he projected a peak somewhere between 1985 one trillion barrels ultimate recoverable and 2000 two trillion barrels recoverable ayers made his projections without a mathematical model he wrote but if the curve is made to look reasonable it is quite possible to adapt mathematical expressions to it and to determine in this way the peak dates corresponding to various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers14 by observing past discoveries and production levels and predicting future discovery trends the geoscientist m king hubbert used statistical modelling in 1956 to accurately15 predict that united states oil production would peak between 1965 and 1971.16 hubbert used a semi-logistical curved model sometimes incorrectly compared to a normal distribution he assumed the production rate of a limited resource would follow a roughly symmetrical distribution depending on the limits of exploitability and market pressures the rise or decline of resource production over time might be sharper or more stable appear more linear or curved17 that model and its variants are now called hubbert peak theory they have been used to describe and predict the peak and decline of production from regions countries and multinational areas17 the same theory has also been applied to other limited-resource production in a 2006 analysis of hubbert theory it was noted that uncertainty in real world oil production amounts and confusion in definitions increases the uncertainty in general of production predictions by comparing the fit of various other models it was found that hubberts methods yielded the closest fit over all but that none of the models were very accurate17 in 1956 hubbert himself recommended using a family of possible production curves when predicting a production peak and decline curve16 more recently the term peak oil was popularized by colin campbell and kjell aleklett in 2002 when they helped form the association for the study of peak oil and gas aspo18 in his publications hubbert used the term peak production rate and peak in the rate of discoveries16 demandedit global consumption of oil 19802013 energy information administration the demand side of peak oil over time is concerned with the total quantity of oil that the global market would choose to consume at various possible market prices and how this entire listing of quantities at various prices would evolve over time global demand for crude oil grew an average of 1.76 per year from 1994 to 2006 with a high growth of 3.4 in 20032004 after reaching a high of 85.6 million barrels 13,610,000m3 per day in 2007 world consumption decreased in both 2008 and 2009 by a total of 1.8 despite fuel costs plummeting in 2008.19 despite this lull world quantity-demanded for oil is projected to increase 21 over 2007 levels by 2030 104 million barrels per day 16.5106m3d from 86 million barrels 13.7106m3 or about 0.8 average annual growth due in large part to increases in demand from the transportation sector202122 according to projections by the international energy agency iea in 2013 growth in global oil demand will be significantly outpaced by growth in production capacity over the next 5 years2324 developments in late 20142015 have seen an oversupply of global markets leading to a significant drop in the price of oil25 oil consumption per capita darker colors represent more consumption gray represents no data energy demand is distributed amongst four broad sectors transportation residential commercial and industrial2627 in terms of oil use transportation is the largest sector and the one that has seen the largest growth in demand in recent decades this growth has largely come from new demand for personal-use vehicles powered by internal combustion engines28 this sector also has the highest consumption rates accounting for approximately 71 of the oil used in the united states in 2013.29 and 55 of oil use worldwide as documented in the hirsch report transportation is therefore of particular interest to those seeking to mitigate the effects of peak oil although demand growth is highest in the developing world30 the united states is the worlds largest consumer of petroleum between 1995 and 2005 us consumption grew from 17,700,000 barrels per day 2,810,000m3d to 20,700,000 barrels per day 3,290,000m3d a 3,000,000 barrels per day 480,000m3d increase china by comparison increased consumption from 3,400,000 barrels per day 540,000m3d to 7,000,000 barrels per day 1,100,000m3d an increase of 3,600,000 barrels per day 570,000m3d in the same time frame31 the energy information administration eia stated that gasoline usage in the united states may have peaked in 2007 in part because of increasing interest in and mandates for use of biofuels and energy efficiency3233 as countries develop industry and higher living standards drive up energy use oil usage being a major component thriving economies such as china and india are quickly becoming large oil consumers34 for example china surpassed the united states as the worlds largest crude oil importer in 2015.35 oil consumption growth is expected to continue however not at previous rates as chinas economic growth is predicted to decrease from the high rates of the early part of the 21st century36 indias oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020 rising to 5 million barrels per day 790103 m3d37 populationedit world population another significant factor affecting petroleum demand has been human population growth the united states census bureau predicts that world population in 2030 will be almost double that of 1980.38 oil production per capita peaked in 1979 at 5.5 barrelsyear but then declined to fluctuate around 4.5 barrelsyear since39 in this regard the decreasing population growth rate since the 1970s has somewhat ameliorated the per capita decline38 economic growthedit some analysts argue that the cost of oil has a profound effect on economic growth due to its pivotal role in the extraction of resources and the processing manufacturing and transportation of goods40 as the industrial effort to extract new unconventional oil sources increases this has a compounding negative effect on all sectors of the economy leading to economic stagnation or even eventual contraction such a scenario would result in an inability for national economies to pay high oil prices leading to declining demand and a price collapse41 supplyedit global liquids production 2000-2015 indicating the component of us tight oil energy information administration our analysis suggests there are ample physical oil and liquid fuel resources for the foreseeable future however the rate at which new supplies can be developed and the break-even prices for those new supplies are changing international energy agency42 defining sources of oiledit oil may come from conventional or unconventional sources the terms are not strictly defined and vary within the literature as definitions based on new technologies tend to change over time43 as a result different oil forecasting studies have included different classes of liquid fuels some use the terms conventional oil for what is included in the model and unconventional oil for classes excluded44 in 1956 hubbert confined his peak oil prediction to that crude oil producible by methods now in use16 by 1962 however his analyses included future improvements in exploration and production45 all of hubberts analyses of peak oil specifically excluded oil manufactured from oil shale or mined from oil sands a 2013 study predicting an early peak excluded deepwater oil tight oil oil with api gravity less than 17.5 and oil close to the poles such as that on the north slope of alaska all of which it defined as non-conventional46 some commonly used definitions for conventional and unconventional oil are detailed below conventional sourcesedit conventional oil is extracted on land and offshore using standard techniques47 and can be categorized as light medium heavy or extra heavy in grade the exact definitions of these grades vary depending on the region from which the oil came48 light oil flows naturally to the surface or can be extracted by simply pumping it out of the ground heavy refers to oil that has higher density and therefore lower api gravity49 it does not flow easily and its consistency is similar to that of molasses while some of it can be produced using conventional techniques recovery rates are better using unconventional methods50 unconventional sourcesedit oil currently considered unconventional is derived from multiple sources tight oil is extracted from deposits of low-permeability rock sometimes shale deposits but often other rock types using hydraulic fracturing or fracking51 it is often confused with shale oil which is oil manufactured from the kerogen contained in an oil shale see below production of tight oil has led to a resurgence of us production in recent years however tight oil production peaked in 2015 and is not expected to increase again until there is a significant oil price recovery52 us lower 48 oil production from 2012 and anticipated decline in production to the end of 2017 with rig count energy information administration oil shale is a common term for sedimentary rock such as shale or marl containing kerogen a waxy oil precursor that has not yet been transformed into crude oil by the high pressures and temperatures caused by deep burial the term oil shale is somewhat confusing because what is referred to in the us as oil shale is not really oil and the rock it is found in is generally not shale53 since it is close to the surface rather than buried deep in the earth the shale or marl is typically mined crushed and retorted producing synthetic oil from the kerogen54 its net energy yield is much lower than conventional oil so much so that estimates of the net energy yield of shale discoveries are considered extremely unreliable5556 oil sands are unconsolidated sandstone deposits containing large amounts of very viscous crude bitumen or extra-heavy crude oil that can be recovered by surface mining or by in-situ oil wells using steam injection or other techniques it can be liquefied by upgrading blending with diluent or by heating and then processed by a conventional oil refinery the recovery process requires advanced technology but is more efficient than that of oil shale the reason is that unlike us oil shale canadian oil sands actually contain oil and the sandstones they are found in are much easier to produce oil from than shale or marl in the us dialect of english these formations are often called tar sands but the material found in them is not tar but an extra-heavy and viscous form of oil technically known as bitumen57 united states crude oil production exceeds imports for the first time since the early 1990s coal liquefaction or gas to liquids product are liquid hydrocarbons that are synthesised from the conversion of coal or natural gas by the fischer-tropsch process bergius process or karrick process currently two companies sasol and shell have synthetic oil technology proven to work on a commercial scale sasols primary business is based on ctl coal-to-liquid and gtl natural gas-to-liquid technology producing us440 billion in revenues fy2009 shell has used these processes to recycle waste flare gas usually burnt off at oil wells and refineries into usable synthetic oil however for ctl there may be insufficient coal reserves to supply global needs for both liquid fuels and electric power generation58 minor sources include thermal depolymerization as discussed in a 2003 article in discover magazine that could be used to manufacture oil indefinitely out of garbage sewage and agricultural waste the article claimed that the cost of the process was 15 per barrel59 a follow-up article in 2006 stated that the cost was actually 80 per barrel because the feedstock that had previously been considered as hazardous waste now had market value60 a 2008 news bulletin published by los alamos laboratory proposed that hydrogen possibly produced using hot fluid from nuclear reactors to split water into hydrogen and oxygen in combination with sequestered co2 could be used to produce methanol ch3oh which could then be converted into gasoline61 discoveriesedit all the easy oil and gas in the world has pretty much been found now comes the harder work in finding and producing oil from more challenging environments and work areas william j cummings exxon-mobil company spokesman december 200562 it is pretty clear that there is not much chance of finding any significant quantity of new cheap oil any new or unconventional oil is going to be expensive lord ron oxburgh a former chairman of shell october 200863 world oil discoveries peaked in the 1960s the peak of world oilfield discoveries occurred in the 1960s64 at around 55 billion barrels 8.7109m3gbyear.65 according to the association for the study of peak oil and gas aspo the rate of discovery has been falling steadily since less than 10 gbyr of oil were discovered each year between 2002 and 2007.66 according to a 2010 reuters article the annual rate of discovery of new fields has remained remarkably constant at 1520 gbyr67 although us proved oil reserves grew by 3.8 billion barrels in 2011 even after deducting 2.07 billion barrels of production only 8 percent of the 5.84 billion barrels of the newly booked oil was because of new field discoveries us eia but despite the fall-off in new field discoveries and record-high production rates the reported proved reserves of crude oil remaining in the ground in 2014 which totaled 1,490 billion barrels not counting canadian heavy oil sands were more than quadruple the 1965 proved reserves of 354 billion barrels68 a researcher for the us energy information administration has pointed out that after the first wave of discoveries in an area most oil and natural gas reserve growth comes not from discoveries of new fields but from extensions and additional gas found within existing fields69 a report by the uk energy research centre noted that discovery is often used ambiguously and explained the seeming contradiction between falling discovery rates since the 1960s and increasing reserves by the phenomenon of reserve growth the report noted that increased reserves within a field may be discovered or developed by new technology years or decades after the original discovery but because of the practice of backdating any new reserves within a field even those to be discovered decades after the field discovery are attributed to the year of initial field discovery creating an illusion that discovery is not keeping pace with production70 reservesedit main articles oil reserves and list of largest oil fields proven oil reserves 2013 total possible conventional crude oil reserves include crude oil with 90 certainty of being technically able to be produced from reservoirs through a wellbore using primary secondary improved enhanced or tertiary methods all crude with a 50 probability of being produced in the future probable and discovered reserves that have a 10 possibility of being produced in the future possible reserve estimates based on these are referred to as 1p proven at least 90 probability 2p proven and probable at least 50 probability and 3p proven probable and possible at least 10 probability respectively71 this does not include liquids extracted from mined solids or gasses oil sands oil shale gas-to-liquid processes or coal-to-liquid processes72 hubberts 1956 peak projection for the united states depended on geological estimates of ultimate recoverable oil resources but starting in his 1962 publication he concluded that ultimate oil recovery was an output of his mathematical analysis rather than an assumption he regarded his peak oil calculation as independent of reserve estimates737475 many current 2p calculations predict reserves to be between 1150 and 1350 gb but some authors have written that because of misinformation withheld information and misleading reserve calculations 2p reserves are likely nearer to 850900 gb610 the energy watch group wrote that actual reserves peaked in 1980 when production first surpassed new discoveries that apparent increases in reserves since then are illusory and concluded in 2007 probably the world oil production has peaked already but we cannot be sure yet6 concerns over stated reservesedit world reserves are confused and in fact inflated many of the so-called reserves are in fact resources theyre not delineated theyre not accessible theyre not available for production sadad i al-husseini former vp of aramco presentation to the oil and money conference october 2007.7 al-husseini estimated that 300 billion barrels 48109m3 of the worlds 1,200 billion barrels 190109m3 of proven reserves should be recategorized as speculative resources7 graph of opec reported reserves showing jumps in stated reserves without associated discoveries as well as the lack of depletion despite yearly production one difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as proven in many major producing countries the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination62 many worrying signs concerning the depletion of proven reserves have emerged in recent years7677 this was best exemplified by the 2004 scandal surrounding the evaporation of 20 of shells reserves78 for the most part proven reserves are stated by the oil companies the producer states and the consumer states all three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves oil companies may look to increase their potential worth producer countries gain a stronger international stature and governments of consumer countries may seek a means to foster sentiments of security and stability within their economies and among consumers major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with the self-reported numbers from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons during periods of no substantial discoveries over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production analysts have suggested that opec member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves as the opec quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves79 kuwait for example was reported in the january 2006 issue of petroleum intelligence weekly to have only 48 billion barrels 7.6109m3 in reserve of which only 24 were fully proven this report was based on the leak of a confidential document from kuwait and has not been formally denied by the kuwaiti authorities this leaked document is from 2001,80 but excludes revisions or discoveries made since then additionally the reported 1.5 billion barrels 240106m3 of oil burned off by iraqi soldiers in the first persian gulf war81 are conspicuously missing from kuwaits figures on the other hand investigative journalist greg palast argues that oil companies have an interest in making oil look more rare than it is to justify higher prices82 this view is contested by ecological journalist richard heinberg83 other analysts argue that oil producing countries understate the extent of their reserves to drive up the price84 the eur reported by the 2000 usgs survey of 2,300 billion barrels 370109m3 has been criticized for assuming a discovery trend over the next twenty years that would reverse the observed trend of the past 40 years their 95 confidence eur of 2,300 billion barrels 370109m3 assumed that discovery levels would stay steady despite the fact that new-field discovery rates have declined since the 1960s that trend of falling discoveries has continued in the ten years since the usgs made their assumption the 2000 usgs is also criticized for other assumptions as well as assuming 2030 production rates inconsistent with projected reserves6 reserves of unconventional oiledit main articles unconventional oil heavy crude oil oil sands oil shale and fischer-tropsch process syncrudes mildred lake mine site and plant near fort mcmurray alberta as conventional oil becomes less available it can be replaced with production of liquids from unconventional sources such as tight oil oil sands ultra-heavy oils gas-to-liquid technologies coal-to-liquid technologies biofuel technologies and shale oil85 in the 2007 and subsequent international energy outlook editions the word oil was replaced with liquids in the chart of world energy consumption8687 in 2009 biofuels was included in liquids instead of in renewables88 the inclusion of natural gas liquids a bi-product of natural gas extraction in liquids has been criticized as it is mostly a chemical feedstock which is generally not used as transport fuel89 texas oil production declined since peaking in 1972 but has recently had a resurgence due to tight oil production reserve estimates are based on the oil price hence unconventional sources such as heavy crude oil oil sands and oil shale may be included as new techniques reduce the cost of extraction90 with rule changes by the sec91 oil companies can now book them as proven reserves after opening a strip mine or thermal facility for extraction these unconventional sources are more labor and resource intensive to produce however requiring extra energy to refine resulting in higher production costs and up to three times more greenhouse gas emissions per barrel or barrel equivalent on a well to tank basis or 10 to 45 more on a well to wheels basis which includes the carbon emitted from combustion of the final product9293 while the energy used resources needed and environmental effects of extracting unconventional sources have traditionally been prohibitively high major unconventional oil sources being considered for large-scale production are the extra heavy oil in the orinoco belt of venezuela94 the athabasca oil sands in the western canadian sedimentary basin95 and the oil shale of the green river formation in colorado utah and wyoming in the united states9697 energy companies such as syncrude and suncor have been extracting bitumen for decades but production has increased greatly in recent years with the development of steam assisted gravity drainage and other extraction technologies98 chuck masters of the usgs estimates that taken together these resource occurrences in the western hemisphere are approximately equal to the identified reserves of conventional crude oil accredited to the middle east99 authorities familiar with the resources believe that the worlds ultimate reserves of unconventional oil are several times as large as those of conventional oil and will be highly profitable for companies as a result of higher prices in the 21st century100 in october 2009 the usgs updated the orinoco tar sands venezuela recoverable mean value to 513 billion barrels 8.161010m3 with a 90 chance of being within the range of 380-652 billion barrels 103.7109m3 making this area one of the worlds largest recoverable oil accumulations101 unconventional resources are much larger than conventional ones102 despite the large quantities of oil available in non-conventional sources matthew simmons argued in 2005 that limitations on production prevent them from becoming an effective substitute for conventional crude oil simmons stated these are high energy intensity projects that can never reach high volumes to offset significant losses from other sources103 another study claims that even under highly optimistic assumptions canadas oil sands will not prevent peak oil although production could reach 5,000,000bbld 790,000m3d by 2030 in a crash program development effort104 moreover oil extracted from these sources typically contains contaminants such as sulfur and heavy metals that are energy-intensive to extract and can leave tailings ponds containing hydrocarbon sludge in some cases92105 the same applies to much of the middle easts undeveloped conventional oil reserves much of which is heavy viscous and contaminated with sulfur and metals to the point of being unusable106 however high oil prices make these sources more financially appealing79 a study by wood mackenzie suggests that by the early 2020s all the worlds extra oil supply is likely to come from unconventional sources107 productionedit main articles petroleum means of production and extraction of petroleum the point in time when peak global oil production occurs defines peak oil some adherents of peak oil believe that production capacity will remain the main limitation of supply and that when production decreases it will be the main bottleneck to the petroleum supplydemand equation108 others believe that the increasing industrial effort to extract oil will have a negative effect on global economic growth leading to demand contraction and a price collapse40109 thereby causing production decline as some unconventional sources become uneconomical yet others believe that the peak may be to some extent led by declining demand as new technologies and improving efficiency shift energy usage away from oil worldwide oil discoveries have been less than annual production since 1980.6 world population has grown faster than oil production because of this oil production per capita peaked in 1979 preceded by a plateau during the period of 19731979.110 countries producing oil 2013 bblday cia world factbook oil producing countries the increasing investment in harder-to-reach oil is a sign of oil companies belief in the end of easy oil62 also while it is widely believed that increased oil prices spur an increase in production an increasing number of oil industry insiders were reportedly coming to believe that even with higher prices oil production was unlikely to increase significantly among the reasons cited were both geological factors as well as above ground factors that are likely to see oil production plateau111 an important concept with regard to declining easy oil is energy returned on energy invested also referred to as eroei a 2008 journal of energy security analysis of the energy return on drilling effort in the united states concluded that there was extremely limited potential to increase production of both gas and especially oil by looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort the analysis showed very little increase of production attributable to increased drilling this was because of a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort as drilling effort increased the energy obtained per active drill rig was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law the study concluded that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to significantly increase oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region such as the united states112 however contrary to the studys conclusion since the analysis was published in 2008 us production of crude oil has increased 74 and production of dry natural gas has increased 28 2014 compared to 2008.113 anticipated production by major agenciesedit crude oil export treemap 2012 from harvard atlas of economic complexity114 average yearly gains in global supply from 1987 to 2005 were 1.2 million barrels per day 190103m3d 1.7.115 in 2005 the iea predicted that 2030 production rates would reach 120,000,000 barrels per day 19,000,000m3d but this number was gradually reduced to 105,000,000 barrels per day 16,700,000m3d a 2008 analysis of iea predictions questioned several underlying assumptions and claimed that a 2030 production level of 75,000,000 barrels per day 11,900,000m3d comprising 55,000,000 barrels 8,700,000m3 of crude oil and 20,000,000 barrels 3,200,000m3 of both non-conventional oil and natural gas liquids was more realistic than the iea numbers8 more recently the eias annual energy outlook 2015 indicated no production peak out to 2040 however this required a future brent crude oil price of us144bbl 2013 dollars as growing demand leads to the development of more costly resources 116 whether the world economy can grow and maintain demand for such a high oil price remains to be seen oil field declineedit alaskas oil production has declined 70 since peaking in 1988 in a 2013 study of 733 giant oil fields only 32 of the ultimately recoverable oil condensate and gas remained117 ghawar which is the largest oil field in the world and responsible for approximately half of saudi arabias oil production over the last 50years was in decline before 2009.118 the worlds second largest oil field the burgan field in kuwait entered decline in november 2005.119 it is well established that once an oilfield reaches maximum production it will decrease at a certain decline rate for example mexico announced that production from its giant cantarell field began to decline in march 2006 reportedly at a rate of 13 per year120 also in 2006 saudi aramco senior vice president abdullah saif estimated that its existing fields were declining at a rate of 5 to 12 per year121 according to a study of the largest 811 oilfields conducted in early 2008 by cambridge energy research associates the average rate of field decline is 4.5 per year the association for the study of peak oil and gas agreed with their decline rates but considered the rate of new fields coming online overly optimistic122 the iea stated in november 2008 that an analysis of 800 oilfields showed the decline in oil production to be 6.7 a year for fields past their peak and that this would grow to 8.6 in 2030.123 a more rapid annual rate of decline of 5.1 in 800 of the worlds largest oil fields weighted for production over their whole lives was reported by the international energy agency in their world energy outlook 2008.124 the 2013 study of 733 giant fields mentioned previously had an average decline rate 3.83 which was described as conservative117 control over supplyedit entities such as governments or cartels can reduce supply to the world market by limiting access to the supply through nationalizing oil cutting back on production limiting drilling rights imposing taxes etc international sanctions corruption and military conflicts can also reduce supply125 nationalization of oil suppliesedit main article nationalization of oil supplies another factor affecting global oil supply is the nationalization of oil reserves by producing nations the nationalization of oil occurs as countries begin to deprivatize oil production and withhold exports kate dourian platts middle east editor points out that while estimates of oil reserves may vary politics have now entered the equation of oil supply some countries are becoming off limits major oil companies operating in venezuela find themselves in a difficult position because of the growing nationalization of that resource these countries are now reluctant to share their reserves126 according to consulting firm pfc energy only 7 of the worlds estimated oil and gas reserves are in countries that allow companies like exxonmobil free rein fully 65 are in the hands of state-owned companies such as saudi aramco with the rest in countries such as russia and venezuela where access by western european and north american companies is difficult the pfc study implies political factors are limiting capacity increases in mexico venezuela iran iraq kuwait and russia saudi arabia is also limiting capacity expansion but because of a self-imposed cap unlike the other countries127 as a result of not having access to countries amenable to oil exploration exxonmobil is not making nearly the investment in finding new oil that it did in 1981.128 opec influence on supplyedit further information organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec surplus crude oil production capacity us eia opec is an alliance between 12 diverse oil producing countries algeria angola ecuador iran iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab emirates and venezuela to control the supply of oil opecs power was consolidated as various countries nationalized their oil holdings and wrested decision-making away from the seven sisters anglo-iranian socony-vacuum royal dutch shell gulf esso texaco and socal and created their own oil companies to control the oil opec tries to influence prices by restricting production it does this by allocating each member country a quota for production all 12 members agree to keep prices high by producing at lower levels than they otherwise would there is no way to verify adherence to the quota so every member faces the same incentive to cheat the cartel129 united states policy of selling arms and providing security to saudi arabia is often seen as an attempt to influence the saudis to increase oil production according to sociology professor michael schwartz the purpose for the second iraq war was to break the back of opec and return control of the oil fields to western oil companies130 alternatively commodities trader raymond learsy author of over a barrel breaking the middle east oil cartel contends that opec has trained consumers to believe that oil is a much more finite resource than it is to back his argument he points to past false alarms and apparent collaboration84 he also believes that peak oil analysts are conspiring with opec and the oil companies to create a fabricated drama of peak oil to drive up oil prices and profits oil had risen to a little over 30barrel at that time a counter-argument was given in the huffington post after he and steve andrews co-founder of aspo debated on cnbc in june 2007.131 predictions of peak oiledit main article predicting the timing of peak oil pub made by peak yearrange pub made by peak yearrange

after 2020 1999 peter odell 2060 2004 pfc energy 20152020 a selection of estimates of the year of peak world oil production compiled by the united states energy information administration in 1962 hubbert predicted that world oil production would peak at a rate of 12.5 billion barrels per year around the year 2000.45 in 1974 hubbert predicted that peak oil would occur in 1995 if current trends continue132 those predictions proved incorrect however a number of industry leaders and analysts believe that world oil production will peak between 2015 and 2030 with a significant chance that the peak will occur before 2020.133 they consider dates after 2030 implausible134135 by comparison a 2014 analysis of production and reserve data predicted a peak in oil production about 2035.136 determining a more specific range is difficult due to the lack of certainty over the actual size of world oil reserves137 unconventional oil is not currently predicted to meet the expected shortfall even in a best-case scenario134 for unconventional oil to fill the gap without potentially serious impacts on the global economy oil production would have to remain stable after its peak until 2035 at the earliest138 papers published since 2010 have been relatively pessimistic a 2010 kuwait university study predicted production would peak in 2014.139 a 2010 oxford university study predicted that production will peak before 2015,10 but its projection of a change soon from a demand-led market to a supply constrained market was incorrect a 2014 validation of a significant 2004 study in the journal energy proposed that it is likely that conventional oil production peaked according to various definitions between 2005 and 2011 a set of models published in a 2014 phd thesis predicted that a 2012 peak would be followed by a drop in oil prices which in some scenarios could turn into a rapid rise in prices thereafter140 according to energy blogger ron patterson the peak of world oil production was probably around 2010.12 major oil companies hit peak production in 2005.141142 several sources in 2006 and 2007 predicted that worldwide production was at or past its maximum5679 fatih birol chief economist at the international energy agency also stated that crude oil production for the world has already peaked in 2006.143 however in 2013 opecs figures showed that world crude oil production and remaining proven reserves were at record highs144 according to matthew simmons former chairman of simmons company international and author of twilight in the desert the coming saudi oil shock and the world economy peaking is one of these fuzzy events that you only know clearly when you see it through a rear view mirror and by then an alternate resolution is generally too late145 possible consequencesedit further information hirsch report and malthusian catastrophe the wide use of fossil fuels has been one of the most important stimuli of economic growth and prosperity since the industrial revolution allowing humans to participate in takedown or the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced some believe that when oil production decreases human culture and modern technological society will be forced to change drastically the impact of peak oil will depend heavily on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of effective alternatives in 2005 the united states department of energy published a report titled peaking of world oil production impacts mitigation risk management146 known as the hirsch report it stated the peaking of world oil production presents the us and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem as peaking is approached liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically and without timely mitigation the economic social and political costs will be unprecedented viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides but to have substantial impact they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking some of the information was updated in 2007.147 oil pricesedit main articles world oil market chronology from 2003 and price of petroleum historical oil pricesedit long-term oil prices 18612015 top line adjusted for inflation the oil price historically was comparatively low until the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis when it increased more than tenfold during that six-year timeframe even though the oil price dropped significantly in the following years it has never come back to the previous levels oil price began to increase again during the 2000s until it hit historical heights of 143 per barrel 2007 inflation adjusted dollars on 30 june 2008.148 as these prices were well above those that caused the 1973 and 1979 energy crises they contributed to fears of an economic recession similar to that of the early 1980s.149 it is generally agreed that the main reason for the price spike in 20052008 was strong demand pressure150 for example global consumption of oil rose from 30 billion barrels 4.8109m3 in 2004 to 31 billion in 2005 the consumption rates were far above new discoveries in the period which had fallen to only eight billion barrels of new oil reserves in new accumulations in 2004.151 asset write downs for oil companies 2015 oil price increases were partially fueled by reports that petroleum production is at567 or near full capacity9152153 in june 2005 opec stated that they would struggle to pump enough oil to meet pricing pressures for the fourth quarter of that year154 from 2007 to 2008 the decline in the us dollar against other significant currencies was also considered as a significant reason for the oil price increases155 as the dollar lost approximately 14 of its value against the euro from may 2007 to may 2008 besides supply and demand pressures at times security related factors may have contributed to increases in prices153 including the war on terror missile launches in north korea156 the crisis between israel and lebanon157 nuclear brinkmanship between the us and iran158 and reports from the us department of energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves159 depicts eia projections for west texas intermediate crude oil price for 2016-2017 more recently between 2011 and 2014 the price of crude oil was relatively stable fluctuating around us100 per barrel it dropped sharply in late 2014 to below us70 where it remained for most of 2015 in early 2016 it traded at a low of us27160 the price drop has been attributed to both oversupply and reduced demand as a result of the slowing global economy161 opec reluctance to concede market share162 and a stronger us dollar163 these factors may be exacerbated by a combination of monetary policy and the increased debt of oil producers who may increase production to maintain liquidity164 this price drop has placed many us tight oil producers under considerable financial pressure165 as a result there has been a reduction by oil companies in capital expenditure of over us400 billion166 it is anticipated that this will have effects on global production in the longer term leading to statements of concern by the international energy agency that governments should not be complacent about energy security167 energy information agency projections anticipate market oversupply and prices below us50 until late 2017.168 effects of historical oil price risesedit main article effects of oil price world consumption of primary energy by energy type169 in the past the price of oil has led to economic recessions such as the 1973 and 1979 energy crises the effect the price of oil has on an economy is known as a price shock in many european countries which have high taxes on fuels such price shocks could potentially be mitigated somewhat by temporarily or permanently suspending the taxes as fuel costs rise170 this method of softening price shocks is less useful in countries with much lower gas taxes such as the united states a baseline scenario for a recent imf paper found oil production growing at 0.8 as opposed to a historical average of 1.8 would result in a small reduction in economic growth of 0.20.4.171 researchers at the stanford energy modeling forum found that the economy can adjust to steady gradual increases in the price of crude better than wild lurches172 some economists predict that a substitution effect will spur demand for alternate energy sources such as coal or liquefied natural gas this substitution can be only temporary as coal and natural gas are finite resources as well173 prior to the run-up in fuel prices many motorists opted for larger less fuel-efficient sport utility vehicles and full-sized pickups in the united states canada and other countries this trend has been reversing because of sustained high prices of fuel the september 2005 sales data for all vehicle vendors indicated suv sales dropped while small cars sales increased hybrid and diesel vehicles are also gaining in popularity174 eia published household vehicles energy use latest data and trends175 in nov 2005 illustrating the steady increase in disposable income and 2030 per barrel price of oil in 2004 the report notes the average household spent 1,520 on fuel purchases for transport according to cnbc that expense climbed to 4,155 in 2011.176 in 2008 a report by cambridge energy research associates stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the united states and that record energy prices would cause an enduring shift in energy consumption practices177 the total miles driven in the us peaked in 2006.178 the export land model states that after peak oil petroleum exporting countries will be forced to reduce their exports more quickly than their production decreases because of internal demand growth countries that rely on imported petroleum will therefore be affected earlier and more dramatically than exporting countries179 mexico is already in this situation internal consumption grew by 5.9 in 2006 in the five biggest exporting countries and their exports declined by over 3 it was estimated that by 2010 internal demand would decrease worldwide exports by 2,500,000 barrels per day 400,000m3d.180 canadian economist jeff rubin has stated that high oil prices are likely to result in increased consumption in developed countries through partial manufacturing de-globalisation of trade manufacturing production would move closer to the end consumer to minimise transportation network costs and therefore a demand decoupling from gross domestic product would occur higher oil prices would lead to increased freighting costs and consequently the manufacturing industry would move back to the developed countries since freight costs would outweigh the current economic wage advantage of developing countries181 economic research carried out by the international monetary fund puts overall price elasticity of demand for oil at 0.025 short-term and 0.093 long term182 agricultural effects and population limitsedit further information food vs fuel 20072008 world food price crisis agriculture energy and agriculture and food security since supplies of oil and gas are essential to modern agriculture techniques a fall in global oil supplies could cause spiking food prices and unprecedented famine in the coming decades183note 1 geologist dale allen pfeiffer contends that current population levels are unsustainable and that to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the united states population would have to be reduced by at least one-third and world population by two-thirds184185 the largest consumer of fossil fuels in modern agriculture is ammonia production for fertilizer via the haber process which is essential to high-yielding intensive agriculture the specific fossil fuel input to fertilizer production is primarily natural gas to provide hydrogen via steam reforming given sufficient supplies of renewable electricity hydrogen can be generated without fossil fuels using methods such as electrolysis for example the vemork hydroelectric plant in norway used its surplus electricity output to generate renewable ammonia from 1911 to 1971.186 iceland currently generates ammonia using the electrical output from its hydroelectric and geothermal power plants because iceland has those resources in abundance while having no domestic hydrocarbon resources and a high cost for importing natural gas187 long-term effects on lifestyleedit world transport energy use by fuel type 2012 see also peak car a majority of americans live in suburbs a type of low-density settlement designed around universal personal automobile use commentators such as james howard kunstler argue that because over 90 of transportation in the us relies on oil the suburbs reliance on the automobile is an unsustainable living arrangement peak oil would leave many americans unable to afford petroleum based fuel for their cars and force them to use bicycles or electric vehicles additional options include telecommuting moving to rural areas or moving to higher density areas where walking and public transportation are more viable options in the latter two cases suburbs may become the slums of the future188189 the issue of petroleum supply and demand is also a concern for growing cities in developing countries where urban areas are expected to absorb most of the worlds projected 2.3 billion population increase by 2050 stressing the energy component of future development plans is seen as an important goal190 rising oil prices if they occur would also affect the cost of food heating and electricity a high amount of stress would then be put on current middle to low income families as economies contract from the decline in excess funds decreasing employment rates the hirschus doe report concludes that without timely mitigation world supplydemand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction shortages accompanied by huge oil price increases both of which would create a long period of significant economic hardship worldwide191 methods that have been suggested for mitigating these urban and suburban issues include the use of non-petroleum vehicles such as electric cars battery electric vehicles transit-oriented development carfree cities bicycles new trains new pedestrianism smart growth shared space urban consolidation urban villages and new urbanism an extensive 2009 report on the effects of compact development by the united states national research council of the academy of sciences commissioned by the united states congress stated six main findings192 first that compact development is likely to reduce vehicle miles traveled vmt throughout the country second that doubling residential density in a given area could reduce vmt by as much as 25 if coupled with measures such as increased employment density and improved public transportation third that higher density mixed-use developments would produce both direct reductions in co2 emissions from less driving and indirect reductions such as from lower amounts of materials used per housing unit higher efficiency climate control longer vehicle lifespans and higher efficiency delivery of goods and services fourth that although short term reductions in energy use and co2 emissions would be modest that these reductions would become more significant over time fifth that a major obstacle to more compact development in the united states is political resistance from local zoning regulators which would hamper efforts by state and regional governments to participate in land-use planning sixth the committee agreed that changes in development that would alter driving patterns and building efficiency would have various secondary costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify the report recommends that policies supporting compact development and especially its ability to reduce driving energy use and co2 emissions should be encouraged an economic theory that has been proposed as a remedy is the introduction of a steady state economy such a system could include a tax shifting from income to depleting natural resources and pollution as well as the limitation of advertising that stimulates demand and population growth it could also include the institution of policies that move away from globalization and toward localization to conserve energy resources provide local jobs and maintain local decision-making authority zoning policies could be adjusted to promote resource conservation and eliminate sprawl193194 mitigationedit main article mitigation of peak oil to avoid the serious social and economic implications a global decline in oil production could entail the hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives at least ten to twenty years before the peak and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time146 this was similar to a plan proposed for sweden that same year such mitigation could include energy conservation fuel substitution and the use of unconventional oil the timing of mitigation responses is critical premature initiation would be undesirable but if initiated too late could be more costly and have more negative economic consequences195 positive aspectsedit permaculture sees peak oil as holding tremendous potential for positive change assuming countries act with foresight the rebuilding of local food networks energy production and the general implementation of energy descent culture are argued to be ethical responses to the acknowledgment of finite fossil resources196 majorca is an island currently diversifying its energy supply from fossil fuels to alternative sources and looking back at traditional construction and permaculture methods197 the transition towns movement started in totnes devon198 and spread internationally by the transition handbook rob hopkins and transition network sees the restructuring of society for more local resilience and ecological stewardship as a natural response to the combination of peak oil and climate change199 criticismsedit general argumentsedit opponents to the theory of peak oil often cite new oil reserves that have been found which continue to forestall a peak oil event in particular some contend that oil production from these new oil reserves as well as from existing fields will continue to increase at a rate that outpaces demand until alternate energy sources for our current fossil fuel dependence are found200201 as of 2015 analysts in both the petroleum and financial industries were concluding that the age of oil had already reached a new stage where the excess supply that appeared in late 2014 may continue to prevail in the future202203 a consensus appeared to be emerging that an international agreement will be reached to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2c that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels204 further criticism against peak oil is confidence in the various options and technologies for substituting oil205 and indeed there are some promising approaches that seem to have the potential to reduce or even counterbalance the effects of a peak oil situation for example us federal funding has increased for algae fuels since the year 2000 due to rising fuel prices206 numerous more projects are being funded in australia new zealand europe the middle east and other parts of the world207 and private companies are entering the field208 oil industry representativesedit oil industry representatives have criticised peak oil theory at least as it has been presented by matthew simmons the president of royal dutch shells us operations john hofmeister while agreeing that conventional oil production would soon start to decline criticized simmonss analysis for being overly focused on a single country saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter and opec swing producer209 he also pointed to the large reserves at the us outer continental shelf which held an estimated 100 billion barrels 16109m3 of oil and natural gas however only 15 of those reserves were currently exploitable a good part of that off the coasts of louisiana alabama mississippi and texas209 hofmeister also contended that simmons erred in excluding unconventional sources of oil such as the oil sands of canada where shell was active the canadian oil sandsa natural combination of sand water and oil found largely in alberta and saskatchewanare believed to contain one trillion barrels of oil another trillion barrels are also said to be trapped in rocks in colorado utah and wyoming210 but are in the form of oil shale these particular reserves present major environmental social and economic obstacles to recovery211 hofmeister also claimed that if oil companies were allowed to drill more in the united states enough to produce another 2 million barrels per day 320103m3d oil and gas prices would not be as high as they were in the later part of the 2000 to 2010 decade he thought in 2008 that high energy prices would cause social unrest similar to the 1992 rodney king riots212 in 2009 dr christoph rhl chief economist of bp argued against the peak oil hypothesis213 physical peak oil which i have no reason to accept as a valid statement either on theoretical scientific or ideological grounds would be insensitive to prices in fact the whole hypothesis of peak oil which is that there is a certain amount of oil in the ground consumed at a certain rate and then its finished does not react to anything therefore there will never be a moment when the world runs out of oil because there will always be a price at which the last drop of oil can clear the market and you can turn anything into oil into if you are willing to pay the financial and environmental price global warming is likely to be more of a natural limit than all these peak oil theories combined peak oil has been predicted for 150 years it has never happened and it will stay this way according to rhl the main limitations for oil availability are above ground and are to be found in the availability of staff expertise technology investment security money and last but not least in global warming the oil question is about price and not the basic availability rhls views are shared by daniel yergin of cera who added that the recent high price phase might add to a future demise of the oil industry not of complete exhaustion of resources or an apocalyptic shock but the timely and smooth setup of alternatives214 clive mather ceo of shell canada said the earths supply of bitumen hydrocarbons is almost infinite referring to hydrocarbons in oil sands215 othersedit economist robert l bradley jr wrote in a 2007 article in the review of austrian economics that an austrian institutional theory is more robust for explaining changes in mineral-resource scarcity than neoclassical depletionism216 using the writings of erich zimmermann and julian simon bradley also argued in 2012 that resources have subjective rather than objective existences in economics he concluded that what resources come from the ground ultimately depend on the resources in the mind217 attorney and mechanical engineer peter w huber pointed out in 2006 that the world is just running out of cheap oil as oil prices rise unconventional sources become economically viable he predicted that the tar sands of alberta alone contain enough hydrocarbon to fuel the entire planet for over 100 years215 industry blogger steve maley echoed some of the points of yergin rhl mather and hofmeister218 environmental journalist george monbiot responded to a 2012 report by leonardo maugeri219 by proclaiming that there is more than enough oil from unconventional sources for capitalism to deep-fry the world with climate change220 stephen sorrell senior lecturer science and technology policy research sussex energy group and lead author of the ukerc global oil depletion report and
