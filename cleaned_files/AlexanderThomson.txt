thomson by john mossman 1877 alexander greek thomson 9 april 1817 22 march 1875 was an eminent scottish architect and architectural theorist who was a pioneer in sustainable building although his work was published in the architectural press of his day it was little appreciated outwith glasgow during his lifetime it has only been since the 1950s and 1960s that his critical reputation has revivednot least of all in connection with his probable influence on frank lloyd wright1 henry-russell hitchcock wrote of thomson in 1966 glasgow in the last 150 years has had two of the greatest architects of the western world crmackintosh was not highly productive but his influence in central europe was comparable to such american architects as louis sullivan and frank lloyd wright an even greater and happily more productive architect though one whose influence can only occasionally be traced in america in milwaukee and in new york city and not at all as far as i know in europe was alexander

stirlingshire the son of john thomson a bookkeeper and elizabeth cooper thomson he was the ninth of twelve children his father who already had eight grown children from his previous marriage died when alexander was seven the family consequently moved to the outskirts of glasgow but tragedy struck when the eldest daughter jane and three of her brothers died between 1828 and 1830 the year that alexanders mother died the remaining children moved with one of the older brothers william a teacher and his wife and child to hangingshaw just south of glasgow the thomson boys all worked from a young age but the children were also home schooled it is believed that alexander worked in a lawyers office possibly wilson james and kays where his older brother ebenezer was employed as a bookkeeper and where he later became a partner in the business careeredit alexander was eventually apprenticed to glasgow architect robert foote ultimately gaining a place in the office of john baird3 as a draughtsman in 1848 thomson set up his own practice baird thomson with john baird ii who became his brother-in-law and this firm lasted nine years in 1857 as the rising architectural star of glasgow4 he entered into practice with his brother george where he was to enjoy the most productive years of his life he served as president of both the glasgow architectural society and the glasgow institute of architects thomson was an elder of the united presbyterian church of scotland and his deep religious convictions informed his work there is a strong suggestion that he closely identified solomons temple with the raised basilica of the same form of his three major churches5 caledonia road church glasgow he produced a diverse range of structures including villas a castle urbane terraces commercial warehouses tenements and three extraordinary churches of these caledonia road free church 185657 - now a ruin queens park united presbyterian church 1869 - destroyed in wwii and st vincent street church 1859 the last is the only intact survivor hitchcock once stated thomson has built three of the finest romantic classical churches in the world6 thomson developed his own highly idiosyncratic style from greek egyptian and levantine sources and freely adapted them to the needs of the modern city thomsons egyptian halls on union street st vincent street free church at the age of 34 thomson designed his first and only castle craigrownie castle which stands at the tip of the rosneath peninsula in cove overlooking loch long the six-storey structure is scots baronial in style featuring a central tower with battlements steep gables and oriel windows in addition to a chapel and a mews cottage thomsons villa designs were realized at langside pollokshields helensburgh cove the clyde estuary and on the isle of bute his mature villas are grecian in style while resembling no other greek revival housesand they are dominated by horizontal lines and rest on a strong podium7 according to gavin stamp thomson carefully designed his villas with symmetries within an overall asymmetry in a personal language in which the horizontal discipline of a continuous governing orderwhether expressed or impliedwas never abandoned7 regarding similarities to frank lloyd wright stamp states it has often been remarked that there are clear resemblances between the early houses of the prairie school and thomsons horizontally massed design with its low-pitched gables and spreading eaves -- together with a connecting garden as sir john summerson noted there is something wildly american about thomson -- a new world attitude you can see it in the villasa sort of primitivism ultra-tuscan 7 caledonia road church glasgow later in his career he would abandon his eclecticism and adopt the purely ionic greek style for which he is best known as such he is perhaps the last in a continuous tradition of british greek revival architects in attacking the gothic he insisted that stonehenge is really more scientifically constructed than york minsteralluding to pugins comment that in their temples the greeks erected their columns like the uprights of stonehenge8 other important works still standing include moray place great western terrace egyptian halls in union street grosvenor building bucks head building in argyle street grecian buildings in sauchiehall street walmer and millbrae crescents and his villa holmwood house at cathcart terraced houses on millbrae crescent in langside c 1870 grave monuments designed by thomson that are worthy of study include those to the revd ao beattie and the revd gm middleton as well as that for john mcintyre in cathcart old parish cemetery thomson was a visionary who introduced into our vocabulary some of the essential elements of sustainable housing this argument hinges on an unrealized design thomson prepared in 1868 for the glasgow city improvement trust an agency of the town council given the task of redeveloping a large area of slum housing centred on the medieval old town the trust invited thomson and five other prominent architects to propose designs for the reconstruction of various parcels of land along the spine of glasgows high street thomson suggested that closely spaced parallel tenements be built within the central courtyard the ends of which will be open to facilitate ventilation he also proposed that alternate streets be glazed for better warmth and safety for the residents although thomsons ideas failed to catch on at the time new research and cad techniques have helped show how revolutionary was his proposal for improved workers housing writingsedit thomsons published writings include the haldane lectures on the history of architecture 1874 and the inquiry as to the appropriateness of the gothic style for the proposed building for the university of glasgow 1866 which attempted to refute ruskin and pugins claims for the superiority of gothic familyedit on 21 september 1847 thomson married jane nicholson granddaughter of the architect peter nicholson in a double wedding ceremony with her sister jessie who married john baird ii they had twelve children in total and would later lose five of them in an epidemic one brother george thomson 18191878 became a baptist missionary in limbe cameroon then known as victoria9 where he combined his religious activities with a passion for botany an epiphytic orchid of the pachystoma genus was named pachystoma thomsonianum in his honour10 his nephew9 rev william cooper thomson 1829-1878 was a missionary in nigeria after whose first wife the bleeding-heart vine clerodendrum thomsoniae was named1112 deathedit thomson died on 22 march 1875 at his home in moray place in strathbungo glasgow fittingly in one of his own creations the architect was buried in the lair adjacent to that in which his five deceased children were laid to rest in gorbals southern necropolis on 26 march 1875 and he was joined there by his widow jane in 1889 his obituary appeared in building news on 26 march 1875 written by his friend thomas gildard who also wrote his biography13 legacyedit the glasgow institute of architects set up the alexander thomson memorial immediately following his death a marble bust of the architect by john mossman was presented to the corporation galleries sauchiehall street and is now displayed in the kelvingrove art gallery and museum the alexander thomson travelling studentship of which the second winner was charles rennie mackintosh was established in his honor for the purpose of providing a travelling studentship for the furtherance of the study of ancient classic architecture with special reference to the principles illustrated in mr thomsons works14 thomson was the pre-eminent architect of his era in glasgow yet until recently his buildings and his reputation have been largely neglected in the city graced by his works holmwood house is generally considered to be thomsons finest and most original residential subject under the ownership of the national trust for scotland holmwood has been restored to its original condition and opened to the general public during the renovation nineteen panels of a classical frieze depicting scenes from homers iliad were discovered under layers of paint and wallpaper rendering thomsons nickname all the more apt in 1999 a retrospective entitled alexander thomson the unknown genius was held at the the lighthouse reminding glaswegians of the need to preserve the remaining examples of this unique architects contribution to their city the british emigre architect george ashdown audsley closely followed thomsons ornamentation for several of his secular buildings the most notable surviving example is his bowling green offices completed 1896 in new york city the highly carved granite base of this tall office building is in the thomson manner with brick chicago school style floors above bibliographyedit wikimedia commons has media
