a sample of thorium thorium-based nuclear power is nuclear reactor-based fuelled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium according to proponents a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycleincluding much greater abundance on earth superior physical and nuclear fuel properties and reduced nuclear waste production however development of thorium power has significant start-up costs proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium while critics say that development of breeder reactors in general including thorium reactors which are breeders by nature increases proliferation concerns since about 2008 nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply nuclear fuel in place of uranium to generate nuclear power this renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences the latest of which thec13 1 was held at cern by ithec and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries a nuclear reactor consumes certain specific fissile isotopes to produce energy the three most practical types of nuclear reactor fuel are uranium-235 purified ie enriched by reducing the amount of uranium-238 in natural mined uranium most nuclear power has been generated using low-enriched uranium leu whereas high-enriched uranium heu is necessary for weapons plutonium-239 transmuted from uranium-238 obtained from natural mined uranium plutonium is also used for weapons uranium-233 transmuted from thorium-232 derived from natural mined thorium this is the subject of this article some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner safer nuclear power2 according to an opinion piece by a group of scientists at the georgia institute of technology considering its overall potential thorium-based power can mean a 1000 year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankinds negative environmental impact3 after studying the feasibility of using thorium nuclear scientists ralph w moir and edward teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built456 research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors primarily the liquid fluoride

uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity these were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons during that period the government of the united states also built an experimental molten salt reactor using u-233 fuel the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons the msre reactor built at oak ridge national laboratory operated critical for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969 in 1968 nobel laureate and discoverer of plutonium glenn seaborg publicly announced to the atomic energy commission of which he was chairman that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested in 1973 however the us government shut down all thorium-related nuclear researchwhich had by then been ongoing for approximately twenty years at oak ridge national laboratory the reasons were that uranium breeder reactors were more efficient the research was proven and byproducts could be used to make nuclear weapons in moir and tellers opinion the decision to stop development of thorium reactors at least as a backup option was an excusable mistake4 science writer richard martin states that nuclear physicist alvin weinberg who was director at oak ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors78 weinberg himself recalls this period congressman chet holifield was clearly exasperated with me and he finally blurted out alvin if you are concerned about the safety of reactors then i think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy i was speechless but it was apparent to me that my style my attitude and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the aec9 martin explains that weinbergs unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor one that would have zero risk of meltdown    his team built a working reactor     and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nations atomic power effort he failed uranium reactors had already been established and hyman rickover de facto head of the us nuclear program wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs increasingly shunted aside weinberg was finally forced out in 1973.10 despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power many of todays nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it according to chemical engineering news most peopleincluding scientistshave hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it noting a comment by a conference attendee that its possible to have a phd in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy11 nuclear physicist victor j stenger for one first learned of it in 2012 it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since world war ii but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications12 others including former nasa scientist and thorium expert kirk sorensen agree that thorium was the alternative path that was not taken 13142 according to sorensen during a documentary interview he states that if the us had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have probably achieved energy independence by around 2000.15 possible benefitsedit the world nuclear association explains some of the possible benefits16 the thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors it is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible long-term nuclear energy scenarios17 moir and teller agree noting that the possible advantages of thorium include utilization of an abundant fuel inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use together with good economics and safety features 4 thorium is considered the most abundant most readily available cleanest and safest energy source on earth adds science writer richard martin147 thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the earths crust18 the thorium energy alliance estimates there is enough thorium in the united states alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years1718 america has buried tons as a by-product of rare earth metals mining notes evans-pritchard19 almost all thorium is fertile th-232 compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3 fertile u-238 and 0.7 more valuable fissile u-235 it is difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactors byproducts according to alvin radkowsky designer of the worlds first full-scale atomic electric power plant a thorium reactors plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor and the plutoniums isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation141120 several uranium-233 bombs have been tested but the presence of uranium-232 tended to poison the uranium-233 in two ways intense radiation from the uranium-232 made the material difficult to handle and the uranium-233 led to possible pre-detonation separating the uranium-232 from the uranium-233 proved very difficult although newer laser techniques could facilitate that process2122 there is much less nuclear wasteup to two orders of magnitude less states moir and teller4 eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage1413 chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium19 the radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just a few hundred years compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off23 according to moir and teller once started up it needs no other fuel except thorium because it makes most or all of its own fuel4 this only applies to breeding reactors that produce at least as much fissile material as they consume other reactors require additional fissile material such as uranium-235 or plutonium17 thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste in addition the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium wpu or civilian plutonium24 since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed23 however the same is true for u-238 as fertile fuel in the uranium-plutonium cycle comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal nobel laureate carlo rubbia of cern european organization for nuclear research estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium or 3,500,000 tons of coal25 coal makes up 42 of us electrical power generation and 65 in china26 liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof a plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage27 mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium thoriums ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore this makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining as the mine is an open pit which requires no ventilation unlike underground uranium mines where radon levels can be potentially harmful28 summarizing some of the potential benefits martin offers his general opinion thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concernweapons proliferation radioactive pollution toxic waste and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process1413 from an economics viewpoint uk business editor ambrose evans-pritchard has suggested that obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium suggesting a new manhattan project and adding if it works manhattan ii could restore american optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke 25 moir and teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be well under 1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of 100 million per year and as a result a large-scale nuclear power plan usable by many countries could be set up within a decade4 possible disadvantagesedit some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power29 breeding in a thermal neutron spectrum is slow and requires extensive reprocessing the feasibility of reprocessing is still open30 significant and expensive testing analysis and licensing work is first required requiring business and government support17 according to a 2012 report by the bulletin of the atomic scientists about using thorium fuel with existing water-cooled reactors it would require too great an investment and provide no clear payoff noting that from the utilities point of view the only legitimate driver capable of motivating pursuit of thorium is economics29 there is a higher cost of fuel fabrication and reprocessing than in plants using traditional solid fuel rods17 thorium when being irradiated for use in reactors will make uranium-232 which is very dangerous due to the gamma rays it emits this irradiation process may be altered slightly by removing protactinium-233 the irradiation would then make uranium-233 in lieu of uranium-232 which can be used in nuclear weapons to make thorium into a dual purpose fuel31 current projectsedit research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors primarily the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr msr design has been or is now being done in the united states united kingdom germany brazil india china france the czech republic japan russia canada israel and the netherlands1214 conferences with experts from as many as 32 countries are held including one by the european organization for nuclear research cern in 2013 which focuses on thorium as an alternative nuclear technology without requiring production of nuclear waste32 recognized experts such as hans blix former head of the international atomic energy agency calls for expanded support of new nuclear power technology and states the thorium option offers the world not only a new sustainable supply of fuel for nuclear power but also one that makes better use of the fuels energy content33 canadaedit candu reactors are capable of using thorium3435 and

demonstration power project which could provide electrical power to the countrys power grid37 chinaedit at the 2011 annual conference of the chinese academy of sciences it was announced that china has initiated a research and development project in thorium msr technology38 in addition dr jiang mianheng son of chinas former leader jiang zemin led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at oak ridge national laboratory tennessee and by late 2013 china had officially partnered with oak ridge to aid china in its own development3940 the world nuclear association notes that the china academy of sciences in january 2011 announced its rd program claiming to have the worlds largest national effort on it hoping to obtain full intellectual property rights on the technology17 according to martin china has made clear its intention to go it alone adding that china already has a monopoly over most of the worlds rare earth minerals1415719 in march 2014 with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current smog crisis they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10 in the past the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage now they are more interested because of smog said professor li zhong a scientist working on the project this is definitely a race he added41 in early 2012 it was reported that china using components produced by the west and russia planned to build two prototype thorium msrs by 2015 and had budgeted the project at 400 million and requiring 400 workers14 china also finalized an agreement with a canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved candu reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel42 germanyedit the german thtr-300 was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched u-235 as fissile fuel though named thorium high temperature reactor mostly u-235 was fissioned the thtr-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a pebble-bed reactor core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres 2.4 in in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix it fed power to germanys grid for 432 days in the late 1980s before it was shut down for cost mechanical and other reasons indiaedit india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world with comparatively poor quantities of uranium india has projected meeting as much as 30 of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050.43 in february 2014 bhabha atomic research centre barc in mumbai india presented their latest design for a next-generation nuclear reactor that will burn thorium as its fuel ore once built with a target date of 2016 they estimate that the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days44 according to dr r k sinha chairman of their atomic energy commission this will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels mostly imported and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change because of its inherent safety they expect that similar designs could be set up within populated cities like mumbai or delhi44 indias government is also developing up to 62 mostly thorium reactors which it expects to be operational by 2025 it is the only country in the world with a detailed funded government-approved plan to focus on thorium-based nuclear power the country currently gets under 2 of its electricity from nuclear power with the rest coming from coal 60 hydroelectricity 16 other renewable sources 12 and natural gas 9.45 it expects to produce around 25 of its electricity from nuclear power14 in 2009 the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources4647 in late june 2012 india announced that their first commercial fast reactor was near completion making india the most advanced country in thorium research we have huge reserves of thorium the challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material stated their former chairman of indias atomic energy commission48 that vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist homi bhabha4950 indias first commercial fast breeder reactor the 500 mwe prototype fast breeder reactor pfbr is approaching completion at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research kalpakkam tamil nadu as of july 2013 the major equipment of the pfbr had been erected and the loading of dummy fuels in peripheral locations was in progress the reactor was expected to go critical by september 2014.51 the centre had sanctioned rs 5,677 crore for building the pfbr and we will definitely build the reactor within that amount mr kumar asserted the original cost of the project was rs 3,492 crore revised to rs 5,677 crore electricity generated from the pfbr would be sold to the state electricity boards at rs 4.44 a unit bhavini builds breeder reactors in india indias 300 mwe ahwr pressurized heavy water reactor began constructiondubious discuss in 2011.where the design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium that will breed u-233 from th-232 thereafter thorium is to be the only fuel52 by nov 2015 the pfbr was built and expected to delays have since postponed the commissioning criticality of the pfbr to sept 2016,53 but indias commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types54 though procurement of primary fissile material preferably plutonium may be problematic due to indias low uranium reserves and capacity for production55 israeledit in may 2010 researchers from ben-gurion university of the negev in israel and brookhaven national laboratory in new york began to collaborate on the development of thorium reactors56 aimed at being self-sustaining meaning one that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel which is not possible with uranium in a light water reactor56 japanedit in june 2012 japan utility chubu electric power wrote that they regard thorium as one of future possible energy resources57 norwayedit in late 2012 norways privately owned thor energy in collaboration with the government and

proton accelerator-based thorium nuclear power plant59 united kingdomedit in britain one organisation promoting or examining research on thorium-based nuclear plants is the alvin weinberg foundation house of lords member bryony worthington is promoting thorium calling it the forgotten fuel that could alter britains energy plans60 however in 2010 the uks national nuclear laboratory nnl concluded that for the short to medium term the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play in that it is technically immature and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits and concluded that the benefits have been overstated17 friends of the earth uk considers research into it as useful as a fallback option61 united statesedit in its january 2012 report to the united states secretary of energy the blue ribbon commission on americas future notes that a molten-salt reactor using thorium has also been proposed62 that same month it was reported that the us department of energy is quietly collaborating with china on thorium-based nuclear power designs using an msr63 some experts and politicians want thorium to be the pillar of the us nuclear future64 senators harry reid and orrin hatch have supported using 250 million in federal research funds to revive ornl research3 in 2009 congressman joe sestak unsuccessfully attempted to secure funding for
