was introduced as the title of a conference held at the university of california san diego in la jolla california in 1978 organized by biologists bruce wilcox and michael e soul the meeting was prompted by the concern among scientists over tropical deforestation disappearing species eroding genetic diversity within species8 the conference and proceedings that resulted2 sought to bridge a gap existing at the time between theory in ecology and population biology on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other9 conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity biodiversity emerged together helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy the inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to the development of several new subdisciplines including conservation genetics conservation social science conservation behavior and conservation physiology10 descriptionedit the rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a discipline with a deadline11 conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the population ecology dispersal migration demographics effective population size inbreeding depression and minimum population viability of rare or endangered species1213 conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance loss and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic population species and ecosystem diversity56713 the concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50 of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years14 which has contributed to poverty starvation and will reset the course of evolution on this planet1516 conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss species extinctions and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society conservation biologists work in the field and office in government universities non-profit organizations and industry the topics of their research are diverse because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the current biodiversity crisis based on morals ethics and scientific reason organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research monitoring and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales4567 historyedit the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others theodore roosevelt17 natural resource conservationedit conscious efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon718 natural resource conservation however has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community7 this social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the tragedy of the commons1920 from this principle conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict7 for example the alaskan tlingit peoples and the haida of the pacific northwest had resource boundaries rules and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of sockeye salmon these rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed721 there are numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules rituals and organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management2223 conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings there are examples in the tao shinto hindu islamic and buddhist traditions724 in greek philosophy plato lamented about pasture land degradation what is left now is so to say the skeleton of a body wasted by disease the rich soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left25 in the bible through moses god commanded to let the land rest from cultivation every seventh year726 before the 18th century however much of european culture considered it a pagan view to admire nature wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised27 however as early as ad 680 a wildlife sanctuary was founded on the farne islands by st cuthbert in response to his religious beliefs7 early naturalistsedit white gyrfalcons drawn by john james audubon natural history was a major preoccupation in the 18th century with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in europe and north america by 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in germany 250 in great britain 250 in the united states and 300 in france28 preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries before charles darwin set sail on the hms beagle most people in the world including darwin believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged29 george-louis leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief he proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences29 erasmus darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved erasmus darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species ancestors29 the thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist by the early 19th century biogeography was ignited through the efforts of alexander von humboldt charles lyell and charles darwin30 the 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors2728 although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and conservation organizations their writings by modern standards showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections28 conservation movementedit main article conservation movement the modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century enlightenment period particularly in england and scotland2731 a number of thinkers among them notably lord monboddo31 described the importance of preserving nature much of this early emphasis had its origins in christian theology scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of british india the conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles that human activity damaged the environment that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations and that scientific empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out sir james ranald martin was prominent in promoting this ideology publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in british india through the establishment of forest departments32 the madras board of revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842 headed by alexander gibson a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles this was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world33 governor-general lord dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855 a model that soon spread to other colonies as well the united states343536 where yellowstone national park was opened in 1872 as the worlds first national park37 the term conservation came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management mainly for economic reasons of such natural resources as timber fish game topsoil pastureland and minerals in addition it referred to the preservation of forests forestry wildlife wildlife refuge parkland wilderness and watersheds this period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies the sea birds preservation act of 1869 was passed in britain as the first nature protection law in the world38 after extensive lobbying from the association for the protection of seabirds39 and the respected ornithologist alfred newton40 newton was also instrumental in the passage of the first game laws from 1872 which protected animals during their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to extinction41 one of the first conservation societies was the royal society for the protection of birds founded in 1889 in manchester42 as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing originally known as the plumage league43 the group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the fur and feather league in croydon and formed the rspb44 the national trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to promote the permanent preservation for the benefit of the nation of lands to preserve so far practicable their natural aspect in the united states the forest reserve act of 1891 gave the president power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain john muir founded the sierra club in 1892 and the new york zoological society was set up in 1895 a series of national forests and preserves were established by theodore roosevelt from 1901 to 1909.4546 the 1916 national parks act included a use without impairment clause sought by john muir which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in dinosaur national monument in 1959.47 roosevelt and muir on glacier point in yosemite national park in the 20th century canadian civil servants including charles gordon hewitt 10 and james harkin spearheaded the movement toward wildlife conservation48 global conservation effortsedit in the mid-20th century efforts arose to target individual species for conservation notably efforts in big cat conservation in south america led by the new york zoological society4911 in the early 20th century the new york zoological society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities the work of henry fairfield osborn jr carl e akeley archie carr and archie carr iii is notable in this era5051citation needed akeley for example having led expeditions to the virunga mountains and observed the mountain gorilla in the wild became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities he was instrumental in persuading albert i of belgium to act in defense of the mountain gorilla and establish albert national park since renamed virunga national park in what is now democratic republic of congo52 by the 1970s led primarily by work in the united states under the endangered species act53 along with the species at risk act sara of canada biodiversity action plans developed in australia sweden the united kingdom hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued notably the united nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind the programme was adopted by the general conference of unesco in 1972 as of 2006 a total of 830 sites are listed 644 cultural 162 natural the first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the united states which passed back to back legislation in the endangered species act54 1966 and national environmental policy act 1970,55 which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research other conservation developments however have taken hold throughout the world india for example passed the wildlife protection act of 1972.56 in 1980 a significant development was the emergence of the urban conservation movement a local organization was established in birmingham uk a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the uk then overseas although perceived as a grassroots movement its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife initially perceived as radical the movements view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology the society for conservation biology originated in 1985.57 by 1992 most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the convention on biological diversity58 subsequently many countries began programmes of biodiversity action plans to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders as well as protect associated habitats the late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector with the maturing of organisations such as the institute of ecology and environmental management and the society for the environment since 2000 the concept of landscape scale conservation has risen to prominence with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species ecology has clarified the workings of the biosphere ie the complex interrelationships among humans other species and the physical environment the burgeoning human population and associated agriculture industry and the ensuing pollution have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted59 the last word in ignorance is the man who says of an animal or plant what good is it if the land mechanism as a whole is good then every part is good whether we understand it or not if the biota in the course of aeons has built something we like but do not understand then who but a fool would discard seemingly useless parts to keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering aldo leopold a sand county almanac concepts and foundationsedit measuring extinction ratesedit marine extinction intensity during the phanerozoic millions of years ago h kpg trj ptr late d os the blue graph shows the apparent percentage not the absolute number of marine animal genera becoming extinct during any given time interval it does not represent all marine species just those that are readily fossilized the labels of the big five extinction events are clickable hyperlinks see extinction event for more details source and image info extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways conservation biologists measure and apply statistical measures of fossil records160 rates of habitat loss and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy61 to obtain such estimates62 the theory of island biogeography63 is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction the current background extinction rate is estimated to be one species every few years64 the measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the earths species have not been described or evaluated estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist estimated range 3,600,000-111,700,00065 to how many have received a species binomial estimated range 1.5-8 million65 less than 1 of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting its existence65 from these figures the iucn reports that 23 of vertebrates 5 of invertebrates and 70 of plants that have been evaluated are designated as endangered or threatened6667 better knowledge is being constructed by the plant list for actual numbers of species systematic conservation planningedit systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems margules and pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach68 compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region identify conservation goals for the planning region review existing conservation areas select additional conservation areas implement conservation actions maintain the required values of conservation areas conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for grant proposals or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices eg69 systematic strategies generally employ the services of geographic information systems to assist in the decision making process conservation physiology a mechanistic approach to conservationedit conservation physiology was defined by steven j cooke and colleagues as an integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts tools and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications understanding and predicting how organisms populations and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa ie including microbes plants and animals physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations restore ecosystems inform conservation policy generate decision-support tools and manage natural resources10 conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines conservation biology as a professionedit the society for conservation biology is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology into subjects such as philosophy law economics humanities arts anthropology and education56 within biology conservation genetics and evolution are immense fields unto themselves but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology is conservation biology an objective science when biologists advocate for an inherent value in nature do conservationists introduce bias when they support policies using qualitative description such as habitat degradation or healthy ecosystems as all scientists hold values so do conservation biologists conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of science reason logic and values in their conservation management plans5 this sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach there is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large70 the movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach the concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power authority and dominance adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring purposeful and collegial adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the aldo leopold leadership program71 approachesedit conservation may be classified as either in-situ conservation which is protecting an endangered species in its natural habitat or ex-situ conservation which occurs outside the natural habitat72 in-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat ex-situ conservation on the other hand involves protection outside of an organisms natural habitat such as on reservations or in gene banks in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat72 also non-interference may be used which is termed a preservationist method preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans5 in this regard conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans ethics and valuesedit see also conservation ethic and land ethic conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences chan states73 that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values a conservationist researches biodiversity and reasons through a resource conservation ethic 12 which identify what measures will deliver the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time513 some conservation biologists argue that nature has an intrinsic value that is independent of anthropocentric usefulness or utilitarianism intrinsic value advocates that a gene or species be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain aldo leopold was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists his writing is often required reading for those in the profession conservation prioritiesedit a pie chart image showing the relative biomass representation in a rain forest through a summary of childrens perceptions from drawings and artwork left through a scientific estimate of actual biomass middle and by a measure of biodiversity right notice that the biomass of social insects middle far outweighs the number of species right see also biodiversity benefits of biodiversity the international union for the conservation of nature iucn has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis the iucn provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its red list74 the iucn red list serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity75 more than the dramatic rates of species loss however conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on rare endemic or endangered species concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes such as migration and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species including genetic population and ecosystem diversity76 extensive systematic and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity while the conservation status of species is employed extensively in conservation management75 some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity moreover common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services7778 while most in the community of conservation science stress the importance of sustaining biodiversity79 there is debate on how to prioritize genes species or ecosystems which are all components of biodiversity eg bowen 1999 while the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving biodiversity hotspots some scientists eg80 and conservation organizations such as the nature conservancy argue that it is more cost-effective logical and socially relevant to invest in biodiversity coldspots81 the costs of discovering naming and mapping out the distribution of every species they argue is an ill-advised conservation venture they reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species82 biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes species and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the earths surface for example  44 of all species of vascular plants and 35 of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4 of the land surface of the earth83 those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity they point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the earths ecosystems where biomass not biodiversity reigns supreme84 it is estimated that 36 of the earths surface encompassing 38.9 of the worlds vertebrates lacks the endemic species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot85 moreover measures show that maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any better than targeting randomly chosen regions86 population level biodiversity ie coldspots are disappearing at a rate that is ten times that at the species level8087 the level of importance in addressing biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism8889 a hotspot priority approach90 would not invest so heavily in places such as steppes the serengeti the arctic or taiga these areas contribute a great abundance of population not species level biodiversity87 and ecosystem services including cultural value and planetary nutrient cycling91 summary of 2006 iucn red list categories those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem they are concentrated in places that are most threatened and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections92 the iucn red list categories which appear on wikipedia species articles is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scaledubious discuss this is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass87not in citation given species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability ecosystem processes evolutionary adaptability and biomass93 both sides agree however that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective way economic values and natural capitaledit tadrart acacus desert in western libya part of the sahara see also ecosystem services and biodiversity human benefits conservation biologists have started to collaborate with leading global economists to determine how to measure the wealth and services of nature and to make these values apparent in global market transactions94 this system of accounting is called natural capital and would for example register the value of an ecosystem before it is cleared to make way for development95 the wwf publishes its living planet report and provides a global index of biodiversity by monitoring approximately 5,000populations in 1,686species of vertebrate mammals birds fish reptiles and amphibians and report on the trends in much the same way that the stock market is tracked96 this method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has been endorsed by the g85 leaders and the european commission94 nature sustains many ecosystem services97 that benefit humanity98 many of the earths ecosystem services are public goods without a market and therefore no price or value94 when the stock market registers a financial crisis traders on wall street are not in the business of trading stocks for much of the planets living natural capital stored in ecosystems there is no natural stock market with investment portfolios into sea horses amphibians insects and other creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable to society98 the ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planets ecosystems by about 30percent which is the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have registered decline from 1970 through 2005.96 the ecological credit crunch is a global challenge the living planet report 2008 tells us that more than three-quarters of the worlds people live in nations that are ecological debtors their national consumption has outstripped their countrys biocapacity thus most of us are propping up our current lifestyles and our economic growth by drawing and increasingly overdrawing upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world wwf living planet report96 the inherent natural economy plays an essential role in sustaining humanity99 including the regulation of global atmospheric chemistry pollinating crops pest control100 cycling soil nutrients purifying our water supply101 supplying medicines and health benefits102 and unquantifiable quality of life improvements there is a relationship a correlation between markets and natural capital and social income inequity and biodiversity loss this means that there are greater rates of biodiversity loss in places where the inequity of wealth is greatest103 although a direct market comparison of natural capital is likely insufficient in terms of human value one measure of ecosystem services suggests the contribution amounts to trillions of dollars yearly104105106107 for example one segment of north american forests has been assigned an annual value of 250 billion dollars108 as another example honey-bee pollination is estimated to provide between 10 and 18 billion dollars of value yearly109 the value of ecosystem services on one new zealand island has been imputed to be as great as the gdp of that region110 this planetary wealth is being lost at an incredible rate as the demands of human society is exceeding the bio-regenerative capacity of the earth while biodiversity and ecosystems are resilient the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many ecosystem functions through technological innovation strategic species conceptsedit keystone speciesedit main article keystone species some species called a keystone species form a central supporting hub unique to their the ecosystem111 the loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function as well as the loss of coexisting species5 keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem111 the importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the stellers sea cow hydrodamalis gigas through its interaction with sea otters sea urchins and kelp kelp beds grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the food chain sea urchins feed on kelp while sea otters feed on sea urchins with the rapid decline of sea otters due to overhunting sea urchin populations grazed unrestricted on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed left unchecked the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the stellers sea cows diet and hastened their demise112 the sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival however this was later questioned by turvey and risley113 who showed that hunting alone would have driven the stellers sea cow extinct indicator speciesedit main article indicator species an indicator species has a narrow set of ecological requirements therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem some animals such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to wetlands have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a miners canary indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities5 monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice such as through different forest silviculture treatments and management scenarios or to measure the degree of harm that a pesticide may impart on the health of an ecosystem government regulators consultants or ngos regularly monitor indicator species however there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective114 it is generally recommended that multiple indicators genes populations species communities and landscape be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex and often unpredictable response from ecosystem dynamics noss 19971158889 umbrella and flagship speciesedit main articles umbrella species and flagship species an example of an umbrella species is the monarch butterfly because of its lengthy migrations and aesthetic value the monarch migrates across north america covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats an umbrella species is often used as flagship species which are species such as the giant panda the blue whale the tiger the mountain gorilla and the monarch butterfly that capture the publics attention and attract support for conservation measures5 context and trendsedit conservation biologists study trends and process from the paleontological past to the ecological present as they gain an understanding of the context related to species extinction1 it is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in earths history these include the ordovician 440 mya devonian 370 mya permiantriassic 245 mya triassicjurassic 200 mya and cretaceouspaleogene extinction event 66 mya extinction spasms within the last 10,000 years human influence over the earths ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost116 that is to say the rates of deforestation reef destruction wetland draining and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species the latest living planet report by the world wide fund for nature estimates that we have exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet requiring 1.5 earths to support the demands placed on our natural resources117 holocene extinctionedit main article holocene extinction event an art scape image showing the relative importance of animals in a rain forest through a summary of a childs perception compared with b a scientific estimate of the importance the size of the animal represents its importance the childs mental image places importance on big cats birds butterflies and then reptiles versus the actual dominance of social insects such as ants conservation biologists are dealing with and have published evidence from all corners of the planet indicating that humanity may be causing the sixth and fastest planetary extinction event118119120 it has been suggested that we are living in an era of unprecedented numbers of species extinctions also known as the holocene extinction event121 the global extinction rate may be approximately 1,000 times higher than the natural background extinction rate122 it is estimated that two-thirds of all mammal genera and one-half of all mammal species weighing at least 44 kilograms 97lb have gone extinct in the last 50,000 years113123124125 the global amphibian assessment126 reports that amphibians are declining on a global scale faster than any other vertebrate group with over 32 of all surviving species being threatened with extinction the surviving populations are in continual decline in 43 of those that are threatened since the mid-1980s the actual rates of extinction have exceeded 211 times rates measured from the fossil record127 however the current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate for amphibians127 the global extinction trend occurs in every major vertebrate group that is being monitored for example 23 of all mammals and 12 of all birds are red listed by the international union for conservation of nature iucn meaning they too are threatened with extinction even though extinction is natural the decline in species is happening at such an incredible rate that evolution can simply not match therefore leading to the greatest continual mass extinction on earth128 humans have dominated the planet and our high consumption of resources along with the pollution generated is affecting the environments in which other species live128129 there are a wide variety of species that humans are working to protect such as the hawaiian crow and the whooping crane of texas130 people can also take action on preserving species by advocating and voting for policies that improve climate the earths oceans especially require attention as climate change has altered ph levels making it inhabitable for organisms with shells that are dissolving as a result122 status of oceans and reefsedit see also ocean coral reef marine pollution and marine conservation global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline by 2000 27 of the worlds coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed the largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic bleaching event in 1998 where approximately 16 of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year coral bleaching is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals131 decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years the loss of coral reefs which are predicted to go extinct in the next century threatens the balance of global biodiversity will have huge economic impacts and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of people132 conservation biology plays an important role in international agreements covering the worlds oceans131 and other issues pertaining to biodiversity133 these predictions will undoubtedly appear extreme but it is difficult to imagine how such changes will not come to pass without fundamental changes in human behavior jb jackson1611463 the oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in co2 levels this is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic natural resources a concern is that the majority of all marine species will not be able to evolve or acclimate in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry134 the prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when  90 of all of the large average approximately 50 kg open ocean tuna billfishes and sharks in the ocean16 are reportedly gone given the scientific review of current trends the ocean is predicted to have few surviving multi-cellular organisms with only microbes left to dominate marine ecosystems16 groups other than vertebratesedit serious concerns also being raised about taxonomic groups that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates these include fungal including lichen-forming species135 invertebrate particularly insect14136137 and plant communities where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented conservation of fungi and conservation of insects in particular are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology as mycorrhizal symbionts and as decomposers and recyclers fungi are essential for sustainability of forests135 the value of insects in the biosphere is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of species richness the greatest bulk of biomass on land is found in plants which is sustained by insect relations this great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically unpleasant creatures138139 one area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing honey bees apis mellifera honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops the use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world140 the sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or colony collapse disorder ccd is not uncommon however in 16-month period from 2006 through 2007 29 of 577 beekeepers across the united states reported ccd losses in up to 76 of their colonies this sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector the cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists pests pesticides and global warming are all being considered as possible causes141142 another highlight that links conservation biology to insects forests and climate change is the mountain pine beetle dendroctonus ponderosae epidemic of british columbia canada which has infested 470,000km2 180,000sqmi of forested land since 1999.88 an action plan has been prepared by the government of british columbia to address this problem143 this impact pine beetle epidemic converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak in the worst year the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in british columbia were equivalent to 75 of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of canada during 19591999 kurz et al89 conservation biology of parasitesedit main article conservation biology of parasites a large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction a few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals however most of them are harmless threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations or the extinction of host species threats to biodiversityedit main article biodiversity threats today many threats to biodiversity exist an acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day hippo stands for habitat loss invasive species pollution human population and overharvesting144 the primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction such as deforestation agricultural expansion urban development and overexploitation such as wildlife trade116145146147148149 habitat fragmentation also poses challenges because the global network of protected areas only covers 11.5 of the earths surface150 a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology151152 human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect of the current extinction spasm wake and vredenburg118 however human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere with conservation management and planning for biodiversity at all levels from genes to ecosystems there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature153 even with the current threats to biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start anew many of the threats to biodiversity including disease and climate change are reaching inside borders of protected areas leaving them not-so protected eg yellowstone national park154 climate change for example is often cited as a serious threat in this regard because there is a feedback loop between species extinction and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere8889 ecosystems store and cycle large amounts of carbon which regulates global conditions155 in present day there have been major climate shifts with temperature changes making survival of some species difficult144 the effects of global warming add a catastrophic threat toward a mass extinction of global biological diversity156 conservationists have claimed that not all the species can be saved and they have to decide which their efforts should be used to protect this concept is known as the conservation triage144 the extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent of all species by 2050,156 or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years14 the current extinction rate is 100-100,000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years144 see alsoedit applied ecology biodiversity

between genetics and ecology soul was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist sir otto frankel to advance conservation genetics as a new field at the time jared diamond who suggested the idea for a conference to wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation wilcox and thomas lovejoy who together initiated planning for the conference in june 1977 when lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at world wildlife fund felt both genetics and ecology should be represented wilcox suggested use of a new term conservation biology to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation subsequently soul and wilcox wrote in the program for the meeting they jointly convened on september 69 1978 titled first international conference on resesarch in conservation biology the purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology community ecology sociobiology population genetics and reproductive biology this
