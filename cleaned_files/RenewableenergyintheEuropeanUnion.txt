sources used for gross electricity production in europe between 1990 and 2013 measured in gwh the maastricht treaty set an objective of promoting stable growth while protecting the environment the amsterdam treaty added the principle of sustainable development to the objectives of the eu since 1997 the eu has been working towards a renewable energy supply equivalent to 12 of the total eus energy consumption by 2010 the johannesburg summit failed to introduce the radical changes targeted for ten years after the rio summit no specific goals were set for the energy sector which disappointed many countries while the eu had proposed an annual increase in the use of renewable energy at a rate of 1.5 worldwide until 2010 johannesburgs action plan did not recommend such a substantial increase with no concrete goals nor dates being set the eu was unwilling to accept this result and with other nations formed a group of pioneer countries that promised to establish ambitious national or even regional goals to achieve global targets the johannesburg renewable energy coalition jrec has a total of more than 80 member countries the eu members brazil south africa and new zealand amongst them in the european conference for renewable energy in berlin in 2004 the eu defined ambitious goals of its own the conclusion was that by 2020 the eu would seek to obtain 20 of its total energy consumption requirements with renewable energy sources up until that point the eu had only set targets up to 2010 and this proposal was the first to represent the eus commitment up to 2020 renewable energy targetsedit in 2009 the renewables directive set binding targets for all eu member states such that the eu will reach a 20 share of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and a 10 share of renewable energy specifically in the transport sector by 2014 the eu realized a 16 share of energy from renewable sources with nine member states already achieving its goals in 2014 negotiations about eu energy and climate targets until 2030 are set to start central and eastern european member states are likely to attempt to slow down the transformation process34 the key parts of the european renewable energy targets agreement set in 2014 are as proposed by a shell lobbyist in october 2011 shell is the sixth biggest lobbyist in brussels spending between 4.25-4.5m a year lobbying the eu institutions agreement has no binding targets for member states on energy efficiency or renewable energy5 links to climate policyedit underlying many of the eus energy policy proposals is the goal to limit global temperature changes to no more than 2c above pre-industrial levels6 of which 0.8c has already taken place and another 0.50.7c for total warming of 1.3-1.5c is already committed7 2c is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid dangerous global warming8 however some scientists such as kevin anderson3 professor of energy and climate change in the school of mechanical aeronautical and civil engineering at the university of manchester and former director of the tyndall centre the uks leading academic climate change research organisation have argued that to be consistent with the science 1c is a more accurate threshold for dangerous climate change910 actionsedit eu energy efficiency and renewable energy actions includes build up the covenant of mayors

state expects to reach its legally binding 2020 target for the share of renewable energy in their final energy consumption member states must set out the sectoral targets the technology mix they expect to use the trajectory they will follow and the measures and reforms they will undertake to overcome the barriers to developing renewable energy the plans are published by the ec upon receipt in the original language allowing public scrutiny the commission will evaluate them assessing their completeness and credibility in parallel the plans will be translated into english in addition the energy research centre of the netherlands was contracted by the european environment agency to create an external database and quantitative report of the reports received so far the member states which joined the eu in 2004 must apply the provisions of directive 200177ec on producing electricity from renewable energy sources their accession treaty sets national indicative targets for the proportion of electricity produced from res res-e in each new member state the result of which is an overall objective of 21 for the eu-25 the member states must adopt and publish initially every five years a report setting the indicative member state targets for future res-e consumption for the following ten years and showing what measures have or are to be taken to meet those targets the member state targets must take account of the reference values set out in the annex to the directive for member states indicative targets concerning the share of electricity produced from renewable energy

generated from renewable energy sources15 the most important generation sources were hydroelectric 30 and wind power 18 with bioenergy 5 and photovoltaic solar power 0,5 accounting for the rest in 2001 the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument the e4 programme energy efficiency and endogenous energies consisting of a set of multiple diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent integrated approach to energy supply and demand by promoting energy efficiency and the use of endogenous renewable energy sources the programme seeks to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the countrys social fabric while simultaneously preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions especially the co2 responsible for climatic change as a result in the five years between 2005 and 2010 energy production from renewable sources increased 28.16 in january 2014 91 of the monthly needed portuguese electricity consumption
