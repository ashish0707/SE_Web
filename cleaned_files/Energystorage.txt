the energy present at the initial formation of the universe is stored in stars such as the sun and is used by humans directly eg through solar heating or sun tanning or indirectly eg by growing crops consuming photosynthesized plants or conversion into electricity in solar cells as a purposeful activity energy storage has existed since pre-history though it was often not explicitly recognized as such an example of mechanical energy storage is the use of logs or boulders as defensive measures in ancient fortsthe logs or boulders were collected at the top of a hill or wall and the energy thus stored was used to attack invaders who came within range certainly storing dried wood or another source for fire or preserving edible food or seeds in dry or cool areas such as in a cave under rocks or underground serves as other examples of energy storage recent historyedit in the twentieth century grid electrical power was largely generated by burning fossil fuel when less power was required less fuel was burned concerns with air pollution energy imports and global warming have spawned the growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind power wind power is uncontrolled and may be

hydroelectricityedit main article hydroelectricity hydroelectric dams with reservoirs can be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released when demand is high the net effect is similar to pumped storage but without the pumping loss while a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from other generating units it behaves equivalently by lowering output in periods of excess electricity from other sources in this mode dams are one of the most efficient forms of energy storage because only the timing of

rechargeable batteries have higher initial cost but can be recharged very cheaply and used many times common rechargeable battery chemistries include leadacid battery lead acid batteries hold the largest market share of electric storage products a single cell produces about 2v when charged in the charged state the metallic lead negative electrode and the lead sulfate positive electrode are

electric double-layer capacitors edlc or ultracapacitors are generic terms for a family of electrochemical capacitors32 that do not have conventional solid dielectrics capacitance is determined by two storage principles double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance333435 supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and rechargeable batteries they store the most energy per unit volume or mass energy density among capacitors they support up to 10,000 farads12volt36 up to 10,000 times that of electrolytic capacitors but deliver or accept less than half as much power per unit time power density32 while supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10 of batteries their power density is generally 10 to 100 times greater this results in much shorter

ultrabatteryedit main article ultrabattery the ultrabattery is a hybrid lead-acid cell and carbon-based ultracapacitor or supercapacitor invented by australias national research body the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro the lead-acid cell and ultracapacitor share the sulfuric acid electrolyte and both are packaged into the same physical unit37 the ultrabattery can be manufactured with similar physical and electrical characteristics to conventional lead-acid batteries making it possible to cost-effectively replace many lead-acid applications the ultrabattery tolerates high charge and discharge levels and endures large numbers of cycles outperforming previous lead-acid cells by more than an order of magnitude38 in hybrid-electric vehicle tests millions of cycles have been achieved39 the ultrabattery is also highly tolerant to the effects of sulfation compared with traditional lead-acid cells40 this means it can operate continuously in partial state of charge whereas traditional lead-acid batteries are generally held at full charge between discharge events it is generally electrically inefficient to fully charge a lead-acid battery so by decreasing time spent in the top region of charge the ultrabattery achieves high efficiencies typically between 85 and 95 dc-dc41 the ultrabattery can work across a wide range of applications the constant cycling and fast charging and discharging necessary for applications such as grid regulation and leveling and electric vehicles can damage chemical batteries but are well handled by the

applications other chemicaledit power to gasedit main article power to gas power to gas is a technology which converts electricity into a gaseous fuel such as hydrogen or methane the three commercial methods use electricity to reduce water into hydrogen and oxygen by means of electrolysis in the first method hydrogen is injected into the natural gas grid or is used in transport or industry the second method is to combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane using a methanation reaction such as the sabatier reaction or biological methanation resulting in an extra energy conversion loss of 8 the methane may then be fed into the natural gas grid the third method uses the output gas of a wood gas generator or a biogas plant after the biogas upgrader is mixed with the hydrogen from the electrolyzer to upgrade the quality of the biogas hydrogenedit main article hydrogen storage the element hydrogen can be a form of stored energy hydrogen can produce electricity via a hydrogen fuel cell at penetrations below 20 of the grid demand renewables do not severely change the economics but beyond about 20 of the total demandcitation needed external storage becomes important42 if these sources are used to make ionic hydrogen they can be freely expanded a 5-year community-based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators began in 2007 in the remote community of ramea newfoundland and labrador43 a similar project began in 2004 on utsira a small norwegian island energy losses involved in the hydrogen storage cycle come from the electrolysis of water liquification or compression of the hydrogen and conversion to electricity44 about 50kwh 180 mj of solar energy is required to produce a kilogram of hydrogen so the cost of the electricity is crucial at 0.03kwh a common off-peak high-voltage line rate in the united states hydrogen costs 1.50 a kilogram for the electricity equivalent to 1.50gallon for gasoline other costs include the electrolyzer plant hydrogen compressors or liquefaction storage and transportationcitation needed underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground caverns salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields4546 large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by imperial chemical industries for many years without any difficulties47 the european hyunder project indicated in 2013 that storage of wind and solar energy using underground hydrogen would require 85 caverns48 methaneedit main article substitute natural gas methane is the simplest hydrocarbon with the molecular formula ch4 methane is more easily stored than hydrogen and the transportation storage and combustion infrastructure pipelines gasometers power plants are mature synthetic natural gas syngas or sng can be created in a multi-step process starting with hydrogen and oxygen hydrogen is then reacted with carbon dioxide in a sabatier process producing methane and water methane can be stored and later used to produce electricity the resulting water is recycled reducing the need for water in the electrolysis stage oxygen is stored for methane combustion in a pure oxygen environment at an adjacent power plant eliminating nitrogen oxides methane combustion produces carbon dioxide co2 and water the carbon dioxide can be recycled to boost the sabatier process and water can be recycled for further electrolysis methane production storage and combustion recycles the reaction products the co2 has economic value as a component of an energy storage vector not a cost as in carbon capture and storage power to liquidedit power to liquid is similar to power to gas however the hydrogen produced by electrolysis from wind and solar electricity isnt converted into

capacitor has very low inductance and low resistance to provide the high-power 70 megawatts and the very high speed 1.2 microsecond discharges needed to operate a dye laser a capacitor originally known as a condenser is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically practical capacitors vary widely but all contain at least two electrical conductors plates separated by a dielectric ie insulator a capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit so it can be used like a temporary battery or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system55 capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change this prevents loss of information in volatile memory conventional capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kjkg capacitors store energy in an electrostatic field between their plates given a potential difference across the conductors eg when a capacitor is attached across a battery an electric field develops across the dielectric causing positive charge q to collect on one plate and negative charge -q to collect on the other plate if a battery is attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time no current can flow through the capacitor however if an accelerating or alternating voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor a displacement current can flow capacitance is greater given a narrower separation between conductors and when the conductors have a larger surface area in practice the dielectric between the plates emits a small amount of leakage current and has an electric field strength limit known as the breakdown voltage the conductors and leads introduce undesired inductance and resistance research is assessing the quantum effects of nanoscale capacitors for digital quantum batteries5657 superconducting magneticsedit main article superconducting magnetic energy

energy loss in each direction smes loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy smes systems offer round-trip efficiency greater than

requirements64 the 280 mw solana generating station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year65 the 150 mw andasol solar power station is a commercial parabolic trough solar thermal power plant located in spain the andasol plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy so that it can continue generating electricity even when the sun isnt shining66 the largest source and the greatest store of renewable energy is provided by hydroelectric dams a large reservoir behind a dam can store enough water to average the annual flow of a river between dry and wet seasons a very large reservoir can store enough water to average the flow of a river between dry and wet years while a hydroelectric dam does not directly store energy from intermittent sources it does balance the grid by lowering its output and retaining its water when power is generated by solar or wind if wind or solar generation exceeds the regions hydroelectric capacity then some additional form of energy balancing will be needed many renewable energy sources notably solar and wind produce variable power67 storage systems can level out the imbalances between supply and demand that this causes electricity must be used as it is generated or converted immediately into storable forms68 the first method of large scale storage was pumped-storage hydroelectricity areas of the world such as norway washington and oregon states and wales have used geographic features to supply elevated reservoirs using electricity to fill them when needed the water passes through generators and converts the potential energy back to electricity67 pumped storage in norway which gets almost all its electricity from hydro has an instantaneous capacity of 2530 gw expandable to 60 gwenough to be europes battery6869 common forms of renewable energy storage include pumped-storage hydroelectric dams rechargeable

superconducting magnetic coils surplus power can also be converted into methane sabatier process with stockage in the natural gas network7172 in 2011 the bonneville power administration in northwestern united states created an experimental program to absorb excess wind and hydro power generated at night or during stormy periods that are accompanied by high winds under central control home appliances absorb surplus energy by heating ceramic bricks in special space heaters to hundreds of degrees and by boosting the temperature of modified hot water heater tanks after charging the appliances provide home heating and hot water as needed the experimental system was created as a result of a severe 2010 storm that overproduced renewable energy to the extent that all conventional power sources were shut down or in the case of a nuclear power plant reduced to its lowest possible operating level leaving a large area running almost completely on renewable energy7374 another advanced method used at the solar project in the united states and the solar tres power tower in spain uses molten salt to store thermal energy captured from the sun and then convert it and dispatch it as electrical power the system pumps molten salt through a tower or other special conduits to be heated by the sun insulated tanks store the solution electricity is produced by turning water to steam that is fed to turbines since the early 21st century batteries have been applied to utility scale load-leveling and frequency regulation capabilities67 in vehicle-to-grid storage electric

storage for electricity generation natural gas is crowding out other forms such as oil and coal air conditioningedit main article ice storage air conditioning thermal energy storage tes can be used for air conditioning75 it is most widely used for cooling single large buildings andor groups of smaller buildings commercial air conditioning systems are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads in 2009 thermal storage was used in over 3,300 buildings in over 35 countries it works by creating ice at night and using the ice to for cooling during the hotter daytime periods70 the most popular technique is ice storage which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels in this application a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the chillers daytime output a partial storage system minimizes capital investment by running the chillers nearly 24 hours a day at night they produce ice for storage and during the day they chill water water circulating through the melting ice augments the production of chilled water such a system makes ice for 16 to 18 hours a day and melts ice for six hours a day capital expenditures are reduced because the chillers can be just 40 - 50 of the size needed for a conventional no-storage design storage sufficient to store half a days available heat is usually adequate a full storage system shuts off the chillers during peak load hours capital costs are higher as such a system requires larger chillers and a larger ice storage system this ice is produced when electrical utility rates are lower76 off-peak cooling systems can lower energy costs the us green building council has developed the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program to encourage the design of reduced-environmental impact buildings off-peak cooling may help toward leed certification77 thermal storage for heating is less common than for cooling an example of thermal storage is storing solar heat to be used for heating at night latent heat can also be stored in technical phase change materials pcms

storage database iesdb is a free-access database of energy storage projects and policies funded by the united states department of energy office of electricity and sandia national labs79 economicsedit the economics of energy storage strictly depends on the reserve service requested and several uncertainty factors affect the profitability of energy storage therefore not every energy storage is technically and economically suitable for the storage of several mwh and the optimal size of the energy storage is market and location dependent 80 moreover ess are affected by several risks eg81 1 techno-economic risks which are related to the specific technology 2 market risks which are the factors that affect the electricity supply system 3 regulation and policy risks therefore traditional techniques based on deterministic discounted cash flow dcf for the investment appraisal are not fully adequate to evaluate these risks and uncertainties and the investors flexibility to deal with them hence the literature recommends to assess the value of risks and uncertainties through the real option analysis roa which is a valuable method in uncertain contexts81 the economic valuation of large-scale applications including pumped hydro storage and compressed air considers benefits including wind curtailment avoidance grid congestion avoidance price arbitrage and carbon free energy
