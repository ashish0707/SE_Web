sustainable development portal renewable energy portal environment portal v t e efficient energy use sometimes simply called energy efficiency is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services for example insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature installing fluorescent lights led lights or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared with using traditional incandescent light bulbs improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process1 or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses there are many motivations to improve energy efficiency reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the international energy agency improved energy efficiency in buildings industrial processes and transportation could reduce the worlds energy needs in 2050 by one third and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases2 energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy3 and are high priorities in the sustainable energy hierarchy in many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit

energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing energy consumption for example the state of california began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements during the following years californias energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national us consumption doubled4 as part of its strategy california implemented a loading order for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first renewable electricity supplies second and new fossil-fired power plants last5 states such as connecticut and new york have created quasi-public green banks to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers energy costs6 lovins rocky mountain institute points out that in industrial settings there are abundant opportunities to save 70 to 90 of the energy and cost for lighting fan and pump systems 50 for electric motors and 60 in areas such as heating cooling office equipment and appliances in general up to 75 of the electricity used in the us today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself the same holds true for this is home and there is 78 of electricity uses d in your home-owners leaky ducts have remained an invisible energy culprit for years in fact researchers at the us department of energy and their consortium residential energy efficient distribution systems reeds have found that duct efficiency may be as low as 5070 the us department of energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 billion kwh by increasing home energy efficiency7 other studies have emphasized this a report published in 2006 by the mckinsey global institute asserted that there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annumless than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario8 energy productivity which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy the vienna climate change talks 2007 report under the auspices of the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc clearly shows that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost9 appliancesedit see also green computing solar lamp energy saving lamp and power usage effectiveness modern appliances such as freezers ovens stoves dishwashers and clothes washers and dryers use significantly less energy than older appliances installing a clothesline will significantly reduce ones energy consumption as their dryer will be used less current energy efficient refrigerators for example use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001 following this if all households in europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones 20 billion kwh of electricity would be saved annually hence reducing co2 emissions by almost 18 billion kg10 in the us the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kwh of electricity and 27,000,000,000lb 1.21010kg co211 according to a 2009 study from mckinsey company the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases12 modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using energy input labeling13 the impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used for example an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot therefore an energy efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand an energy efficient dishwasher on the other hand uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes this appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand building designedit see also building performance energy-efficient landscaping window insulation film and phase-out of incandescent light bulbs receiving a gold rating for energy and environmental design in september 2011 the empire state building is the tallest and largest leed certified building in the united states and western hemisphere14 though it will likely be overtaken by new yorks own one world trade center15 buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer however the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot the measures that keep buildings comfortable lighting heating cooling and ventilation all consume energy typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building resulting in specific energy consumption sec e n e r g y c o n s u m e d b u i l t a r e a displaystyle frac energy consumedbuilt area however the issue is more complex as building materials have embodied energy in them on the other hand energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy moreover the when the building is used the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments finally overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used or is the building largely empty it has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency sec should be amended to include these factors16 e m b o d i e d e n e r g y e n e r g y c o n s u m e d e n e r g y r e c o v e r e d b u i l t a r e a u t i l i z a t i o n r a t e q u a l i t y f a c t o r displaystyle frac embodied energy energy consumed -energy recoveredbuilt area times utilization rate times quality factor thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy such as better insulation many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use such as increased use of natural light a buildings location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination for example trees landscaping and hills can provide shade and block wind in cooler climates designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun ultimately heat energy entering the building minimizing energy use by maximizing passive solar heating tight building design including energy-efficient windows well-sealed doors and additional thermal insulation of walls basement slabs and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent1317 dark roofs may become up to 39c 70f hotter than the most reflective white surfaces they transmit some of this additional heat inside the building us studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs white roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building13 proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices13 compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent light bulbs newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light and in most applications they are cost effective despite their higher initial cost with payback periods as low as a few months bms integration effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost passive infra reds pirs to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets corridors or even office areas out-of-hours in addition lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the buildings lighting scheme to switch onoff or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption building management systems bms link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole buildings lighting and power requirements18 in an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load the study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector19 the choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency for example replacing an older 50 efficient natural gas furnace with a new 95 efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use carbon emissions and winter natural gas bills ground source heat pumps can be even more energy efficient and cost effective these systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to pump heat against its natural flow from hot to cold for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground the end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground the disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use smart meters are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the buildings energy usage in a dynamic presentable format the use of power quality analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage harmonic distortion peaks swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient often such meters communicate by using wireless sensor networks green building xml gbxml is an emerging schema a subset of the building information modeling efforts focused on green building design and operation gbxml is used as input in several energy simulation engines but with the development of modern computer technology a large number of building energy simulation tools are available on the market when choosing which simulation tool to use in a project the user must consider the tools accuracy and reliability considering the building information they have at hand which will serve as input for the tool yezioro dong and leite20 developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3 of mean absolute error leadership in energy and environmental design leed is a rating system organized by the us green building council usgbc to promote environmental responsibility in building design they currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings leed-ebom and new construction leed-nc based on a buildings compliance with the following criteria sustainable sites water efficiency energy and atmosphere materials and resources indoor environmental quality and innovation in design21 in 2013 usgbc developed the leed dynamic plaque a tool to track building performance against leed metrics and a potential path to recertification the following year the council collaborated with honeywell to pull data on energy and water use as well as indoor air quality from a bas to automatically update the plaque providing a near-real-time view of performance the usgbc office in washington dc is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating leed dynamic plaque22 a deep energy retrofit is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional energy retrofits deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential commercial buildings a deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more perhaps spread over several years and may significantly improve the building value23 the empire state building has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013 the project team consisting of representatives from johnson controls rocky mountain institute clinton climate initiative and jones lang lasalle will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38 and 4.4 million24 for example the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into superwindows which block heat but pass light air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved 17 million of the projects capital cost immediately partly funding other retrofitting25 receiving a gold leadership in energy and environmental design leed rating in september 2011 the empire state building is the tallest leed certified building in the united states14 the indianapolis city-county building recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46 and 750,000 annual energy saving energy retrofits including deep and other types undertaken in residential commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyeruser may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or bought down upstream or midstream buy downs are common for efficient lighting products other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications in addition to rebates which may be offered through government or utility programs governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs to evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings cost-effectiveness analysis or cea can be used a cea calculation will produce the value of energy saved sometimes called negawatts in kwh the energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made thus cea allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative the benefit of the cea approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments26 energy efficiency by countryedit europeedit see also energy efficiency in europe study this section needs expansion with proper text and additional citations you can help by adding to it june 2016 energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030 the eu has set itself a 20 energy savings target by 2020 when compared to the projected use of energy in 2020 roughly equivalent to turning off 400 power stations at an eu summit in october 2014 eu countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27 or greater by 2030 one mechanism used to achieve the target of 27 is the suppliers obligations white certificates27 australiaedit it has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled australian national strategy on energy efficiency discuss february 2016 the australian national government is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency mainly through the governments department of industry and science in july 2009 the council of australian governments which represents the individual states and territories of australia agreed to a national strategy on energy efficiency nsee28 this is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy efficient practices and a preparation for the countrys transformation into a low carbon future there are several different areas of energy use addressed within the nsee but the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency they are to help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future to streamline the adoption of efficient energy to make buildings more energy efficient for governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency the overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the national partnership agreement on energy efficiency29 this document also explains the role of both the commonwealth and the individual states and territories in the nsee as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nations progress in relation to the stated goals and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward germanyedit see also german national action plan on energy efficiency

between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power3412 on 3 december 2014 the german federal government released its national action plan on energy efficiency nape3536 the areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings energy conservation for companies consumer energy efficiency and transport energy efficiency the policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures the central short-term measures of nape include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency the raising of funding for building renovation the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry german industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution on 12 august 2016 the german government released a green paper on energy efficiency for public consultation in

appliances buildings and vehicles and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy efficient equipment41 industryedit industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power most of which is delivered as natural gas petroleum fuels and as electricity in addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility there are however a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries various industries generate steam and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities when electricity is generated the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam heating or other industrial purposes conventional electricity generation is about 30 efficient whereas combined heat and power also called co-generation converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy42 advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel these technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants42 over 45 percent of the fuel used by us manufacturers is burnt to make steam the typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent according to the us department of energy by insulating steam and condensate return lines stopping steam leakage and maintaining steam traps42 electric motors usually run at a constant speed but a variable speed drive allows the motors energy output to match the required load this achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent depending on how the motor is used motor coils made of superconducting materials can also reduce energy losses42 motors may also benefit from voltage optimisationcitation needed industry uses a large number of pumps and compressors of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications the efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better process control and better maintenance practices compressors are commonly used to provide compressed air which is used for sand blasting painting and other power tools according to the us department of energy optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent42 transportationedit main article energy efficiency in

which is why composite materials are widely used in car bodies more advanced tires with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance can save gasoline fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3 by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure44 replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles45 on newer vehicles 1980s and up with fuel-injected computer-controlled engines a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent46 turbochargers can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine the engine of the year 2011 is a fiat 500 engine equipped with an mhi turbocharger compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine the new 85 hp turbo has 23 more power and a 30 better performance index the performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine but fuel consumption is 30 lower47 energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile cutting-edge designs such as the diesel mercedes-benz bionic concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as 84 miles per us gallon 2.8l100km 101mpg-imp four times the current conventional automotive average48 the mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of electric vehicles allelectric or hybrid electric hybrids like the toyota prius use regenerative braking to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars the effect is especially pronounced in city driving49 plug-in hybrids also have increased battery capacity which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline in this case energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process such as coal-burning hydroelectric or renewable source created the power plug-ins can typically drive for around 40 miles 64km purely on electricity without recharging if the battery runs low a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range finally all-electric cars are also growing in popularity the tesla model s sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market street lightingedit cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights50 some cities are seeking to reduce street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to led lamps51 it is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of leds will lead to real reductions in energy as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past52 aircraftedit main articles fuel economy in aircraft and environmental impact of aviation air traffic management there are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation from modifications to the planes themselves to how air traffic is managed as in cars turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption however instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes this allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole new technology allows for superior automation of takeoff landing

production energy conservationedit main article energy conservation elements of passive solar energy design shown in a direct gain application energy conservation is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption for example through behaviour change in addition to using energy more efficiently examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter using the car less air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer or enabling energy saving modes on a computer as with other definitions the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy but both are important in environmental and economic terms53 this is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels54 energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand many energy intermediary organisations for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local regional or national level are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge55 psychologists have also engaged with the issue of energy conservation and have provided guidelines for realizing behavior change to reduce energy consumption while taking technological and policy considerations into account56 the national renewable energy laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of apps useful for energy efficiency57 commercial property managers that plan and manage energy efficiency projects generally use a software platform to perform energy audits and to collaborate with contractors to understand their full range of options the department of energy doe software directory describes energyactio software a cloud based platform designed for this purpose sustainable energyedit main article sustainable energy energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of a sustainable energy policy both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use if energy use grows too rapidly renewable energy development will chase a receding target likewise unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables58 rebound effectedit further information rebound effect conservation and jevons paradox if the demand for energy services remains constant improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions however many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models this is because they make energy services cheaper and so consumption of those services increases for example since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper consumers may choose to drive farther thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings similarly an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution59 these are examples of the direct rebound effect60 estimates of the size of the rebound effect range from roughly 5 to 40.616263 the rebound effect is likely to be less than 30 at the household level and may be closer to 10 for transport60 a rebound effect of 30 implies that improvements in energy efficiency should achieve 70 of the reduction in energy consumption projected using engineering models the rebound effect may be particularly large for lighting because in contrast to tasks like transport there is effectively no upper limit on how much light could be considered useful64 in fact it appears that lighting has accounted for about 0.7 of gdp across many societies and hundreds
