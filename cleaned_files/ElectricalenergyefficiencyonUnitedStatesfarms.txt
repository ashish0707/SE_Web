electrical energy efficiency on united states farms covers the use of electricity on farms and the methods and incentives for improving the efficiency of that use us farms have almost doubled their average energy efficiency over the past 25 years1 contents 1 usage 1.1 use on dairy farms 2 regulations 3 efficiency increases 3.1 crop rotation 3.2 farm energy audits 3.3 energy calculators 3.4 dairy farm efficiency improvements 3.5 cow manure to electrical generation 3.6 government and utility incentives 4 see also 5 references 6 external links usageedit energy costs represent between 2 at cattle feed lots and 9 for grain farming due partly to grain drying of farm production costs2 use on dairy farmsedit in 2006 there were about 65,000 dairy farms in the united states although most had fewer than 200 cows3 one resource auditor believes it is possible for dairy farms to reach an energy usage of as low as 200 kwhr per cow per year4 although an analysis of california dairy farms found that 300 kwhryear was the lowest actually attained5 one study67 found the following electrical usages on new york dairy farms milk cooling 23 ventilation 21 vacuum pumps 18 lighting 17 electrical water heating 10 feeding equipment 7 another study8 found highly similar results regulationsedit main article energy law hitherto almost entirely unregulated except for zoning ordinances and the effects of property taxes environmental concerns are now beginning to impose restrictions on farms how renewable energy projects may be implemented and also on what rate of return electricity producers can obtain from utilities are key current topics acts such as wisconsins clean energy jobs act only proposed as of april 2010 are controversial among farmers for these reasons9 canadas green energy act 2009 implemented similar kinds of regulations10 contrarily carbon offsets may soon offer farmers additional incentives to increase energy use efficiency however at least one proposed cap and trade process would raise farmers costs by up to 1.19 usd per acre11 corporate average fuel economy fuel standards too such as in the energy independence and security act of 2007 are controversial as biofuels are now a significant portion of farm income12 efficiency increasesedit increased efficiency in farm usage of electricity is being driven by greening as well as by economics the biggest users of electrical power are heat light and motors  a recent study found that a 3-hp energy efficient compressor used over 42 percent fewer kilowatt-hours kwhr than a 3-hp conventional compressor13 two prime areas for efficiency improvements are implementing the use of heat recovery systems and variable speed drives14 one organization postulated a three-year plan for farms to use energy better15 crop rotationedit simply including years of either clover or alfalfa into the cycle of grain crops can yield savings without reducing total crop yields1617 farm energy auditsedit farms sometimes use accredited resource auditors18 to analyze their operations and recommend improved efficiencies typically at costs exceeding 1,000 per audit however typical full repayment of an audits cost could be around six years19 also a certified farm energy audit may be required for participation in state or federal energy efficiency programs20 an audit of 20 farms in cumbria showed savings could be made in all areas examined21 an example of a farm energy audit in maine is at the following reference22 maryland has a statewide program entitled ensave23 energy calculatorsedit recently a number of energy calculators2425 have become available addressing one or more aspects of farm energy usage new calculators are being developed under government and utility grants such as one in oregon dairy farm efficiency improvementsedit some improvements are specific to dairy farms such as using supplemental lighting with energy efficient lamps which can increase milk production 5 to 16 percent or relieving heat stress with a combination of sprinklers and fans to increase the cooling effect and improve energy use26 california compiled a complete guide to dairy farm efficiency improvements5 cow manure to electrical generationedit norswiss farms of rice lake wisconsin an 1100 cow dairy farm expects to save over 70,000 per year plus income from electricity sales from its installation of an 848kw combined heat and power chp system operating on anaerobic digesters gas from cow manure27 the electricity generated is sold to the grid a similar installation in 2004 on a 270 cow farm in california one of five in the state at that time powered a 75kw generator28 central vermont public service has a cow power program using methane-fueled electricity from vermont farms2930 government and utility incentivesedit us utilities allocated 5.3 billion to energy efficiency programs in 2009.31 government and utility incentives can be beneficial to those entities as well it may be less expensive for governments to encourage efficiency and renewable energy options in order to delay or negate the need to upgrade and modernize rural grid infrastructure2 a partial list of incentives is available at the following reference32 a link to relevant utility pages is at33 a third partial list is at34 alliant energy in wisconsin funds the installation of energy-saving projects receiving payments on the monthly electric bills35 national grid has a similar program36 see alsoedit agricultureenergy and agriculture feed-in tariff good agricultural practice list of environmental topics
