back to 1997 when then-president bill clinton was focused mostly on fundraising for the future clinton presidential center in little rock arkansas1 former us president bill clinton bill founded the william j clinton foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency13 longtime clinton advisor bruce lindsey became the ceo in 2004.1415 later lindsey moved from being ceo to being chair largely for health reasons14 other clinton hands who played an important early role included doug band16 and ira magaziner additional clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include john podesta and laura graham13 most of the foundations successes came from bills worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives celebrities and government officials13 similarly the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever bill suddenly felt an interest in13 preceding barack obamas 2009 nomination of hillary clinton as us secretary of state bill clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the clinton presidential center and the clinton global initiative17 accordingly a list of donors was released in december 2008.18 by 2011 chelsea clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board1319 to raise money for the foundation she gave paid speeches such as her 65,000 2014 address at the university of missouri in kansas city for the opening of the starr womens hall of fame20 in 2013 hillary clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as secretary of state she planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children2122 as well as economic development14 accordingly at that point it was renamed the bill hillary chelsea clinton foundation13 extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 united states presidential election1314 in july 2013 eric braverman was named ceo of the foundation15 he is a friend and former colleague of chelsea clinton from mckinsey company1314 at the same time chelsea clinton was named vice chair of the foundations board1315 the foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the time-life building in midtown manhattan13 chelsea clinton moved the organization to an outside review conducted by the firm of simpson thacher bartlett its conclusions were made public in mid-201314 the main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former presidents fundraising abilities how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond bill clintons lifetime1314 dennis cheng a former hillary clinton campaign official and state department deputy chief was named to oversee a 250 million endowment drive13 the review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities14 additionally the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundations conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process14 in january 2015 braverman announced his resignation politico attributed the move to being partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation23 he was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary maura pally24 on february 18 2015 the washington post reported that the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support with members of the george w bush administration often participating in its programs5 in march 2015 former secretary of health and human services in the clinton administration donna shalala was selected to run the clinton foundation25 in august 2016 the boston globes editorial board suggested that the clinton foundation cease accepting donations the globes editorial board offered praise for the foundations work but added that as long as either of the clintons are in public office or actively seeking it they should not operate a charity too because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction26 in 2016 the reuters wire news service reported that the clinton foundation suspected that it had been the target of a cyber security breach as a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach clinton foundation officials retained a security firm fireeye to evaluate its data systems the cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions such as the democratic national committee27 in october 2016 the wall street journal reported that four fbi field offices -- in new york los angeles washington and little rock ark -- had been collecting information about the clinton foundation to determine whether there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling in a reported separate investigation the washington field office was investigating terry mcauliffe before he became a board member of the clinton foundation28 board of directors as of october 2016 the board members are29 bruce lindsey chairman chelsea clinton vice chair bill clinton frank giustra rolando gonzalez-bunster eric goosby hadeel ibrahim lisa jackson cheryl mills cheryl saban programs and initiatives clinton health access initiative chai as of january 1 2010 the clinton hivaids initiative an initiative of the clinton foundation became a separate nonprofit organization called the clinton health access initiative chai1330 organizations such as the clinton foundation continue to supply anti-malarial drugs to africa and other affected areas according to director inder singh in 2011 more than 12 million individuals will be supplied with subsidized anti-malarial drugs31 in may 2007 chai and unitaid announced agreements that help middle-income and low-income countries save money on second-line drugs the partnership also reduced the price of a once-daily first-line treatment to less than 1 per day32 the clinton foundation hivaids initiatives work on the ground has been subject of some criticism the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank wrote that governments and organizations in africa and asia that partnered with the foundation expressed caution and alarm at the foundations focus on treating a large number of patients with less regard for the importance of adherence follow-up and quality of care33 chai was spun off into a separate organization in 2010 ira magaziner became its ceo he had been a key figure in the clinton health care plan of 1993.13 chelsea clinton joined its board in 2011 as did tachi yamada former president of the global health program at the bill melinda gates foundation13 clinton global initiative cgi and cgi u the clinton global initiative cgi was founded in 2005 by bill clinton doug band counselor to bill was also heavily involved in the formation16 clinton has credited band with being the originator of cgi and has noted that doug had the idea to do this34 band left his paid position at cgi in 2010,13 preferring to emphasize his teneo business and family pursuits but remains on the cgi advisory board14 the overlap between cgi and teneo of which bill was a paid advisor drew criticism13 one of its major donors is norways government20 million norwegian kroner per year as of 2013.35 president of brazil dilma rousseff opens clinton

industrial park photo kendra helmerusaid the foundation has funded extensive disaster relief programs following the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and hurricane katrina in 2005 shortly after hurricane katrina hit president george w bush asked former presidents george h w bush and bill clinton to raise funds to help rebuild the gulf coast region the two presidents having worked together to assist victims of the indian ocean tsunami established the bush-clinton katrina fund to identify and meet the unmet needs in the region foster economic opportunity and to improve the quality of life of those affected63 in the first month after the hurricane the fund collected over 42,000 online donations alone approximately 128.4 million has been received to date from all 50 states and 30.9 million from foreign countries the foundation has been involved in haiti both before and after the 2010 haiti earthquake6413 no ceilings project in 2013 hillary clinton established a partnership between the foundation and the bill and melinda gates foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the united nations fourth world conference on women in beijing in 1995.6566 this is called no ceilings the full participation project6566 the project released a report in march 2015.67 transparency around 2007 the clinton foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency although us law did not require nonprofit charities including presidential foundations to disclose the identities of their contributors critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because hillary was running to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states commentator matthew yglesias wrote in a los angeles times op-ed that the clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety68 a lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in december 2008,18 which included several politically sensitive donors such as the kingdom of saudi arabia and blackwater worldwide69 the foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that not even the appearance of a conflict of interest would exist once hillary clinton was secretary of state69 the ethics agreement between the state department and the clinton foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary of state clintons tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during february 2015 a wall street journal report found that the clinton foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once secretary clintons tenure had ended70 contributions from foreign donors who are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the us constitute a major portion of the foundations income the foundations chief communications officer craig minassian explained that it is a false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldnt also support philanthropic work5 a washington post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the clinton foundation during the secretarys tenure found six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before clinton became secretary which was permissible under the agreement but also one instance of a new donation 500,000 from algeria for earthquake relief in haiti that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not71 foundation officials said that if the former secretary decided to run for president in 2016 they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations71 but in general they stressed that as with other global charities we rely on the support of individuals organizations corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way when anyone contributes to the clinton foundation it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives71 state department spokesperson jen psaki attested that the foundations commitment to the ethics agreement in question has been over and above the letter of the law72 in august 2016 with less than 90 days before the upcoming presidential election the clinton foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if clinton is elected73 in march 2015 reuters reported that the clinton foundation had broken its promise to publish all of its donors as well as its promise to let the state department review all of its donations from foreign governments74 in april 2015 the new york times reported that when hillary clinton was secretary of state the state department had approved a deal to sell american uranium to a russian state-owned enterprise uranium one whose chairman had donated to the clinton foundation and that clinton had broken her promise to publicly identify such donations75 the state department was one of nine government agencies not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators that had to sign off on the deal76 factcheckorg notes that there is no evidence that the donations influenced clintons official actions or that she was involved in the state departments decision to approve the deal77 and politifact concluded that any suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated76 after her january 2009 appointment as secretary of state hillary clinton proposed hiring long-time clinton friend and confidant sidney blumenthal as an advisor however obamas chief of staff rahm emanuel blocked blumenthals appointment at the state department78 blumenthal was subsequently hired by the clinton foundation and after the 2011 uprising in libya against muammar gaddafi blumenthal prepared from public and other sources about 25 memos which he sent as emails to clinton in 2011 and 2012 with advice regarding libyan matters7980 2015 state department subpoena in february 2016 the washington post reported that the united states department of state issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015 according to the report the subpoena focused on documents about the charitys projects that may have required approval from federal government during hillary clintons term as secretary of state and also asked for records related to huma abedin longtime clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the state department the foundation clintons personal office and a private consulting firm with ties to the clintons81 private philanthropy the clinton foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate due to their similar names the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the clinton family foundation which is reserved for the clintons private philanthropy the two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources10 the significantly smaller clinton family foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving11 headquartered in chappaqua new york it received nearly all of the approximately 14 million the clintons gave to charity from 200713.10 see also clinton
