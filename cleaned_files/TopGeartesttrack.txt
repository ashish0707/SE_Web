automotive television programme top gear it is located at dunsfold aerodrome in surrey united kingdom the track was designed by lotus cars as a testing facility for the colin chapman-run company with many of its formula one cars tested there it is used to test both cars and drivers seen on the programme mainly in power laps and star in a reasonably priced car for the 23rd series of top gear the

time deductions 6 maps 7 appearance in games 8 notes 9 references layoutedit the track is on a former royal canadian air force airbase constructed during the second world war and later used by british aerospace as a manufacturing and test facility the tracks main route marked by painted lines and simple structures such as stacks of tyres was designed by test drivers from lotus12 the layout of the track is designed to put the car through various conditions ranging from provoking understeer to testing brake balance and tyres the track is approximately 1.75 miles 2.82km long it is considered to be an equaliser for cars since according to richard hammond both 060 miles per hour 096.6kmh times and top speed are totally meaningless1 the track also incorporates a drag strip although this is not used for timed segments it does feature in some challenges and other features on the show the course starts on the perimeter road outside the top gear studio the first bend is a fast right-left kink named crooner curves willson bend is the first proper turn on the track and the first corner usually seen when the stig is lapping a car3 chicago a long right-hand around a tyre wall onto the main runway was designed by lotus as a steady state corner designed to highlight understeer or oversteer of the chassis next is hammerhead a left-then-right corner which again highlights understeer and oversteer the track comes to a right-hand curve then the course turns right through the flat-out section called the follow through after the left hand bentley bend named after the person who first discovered jeremy clarkson and former top gear presenter jon bentley but commonly referred to simply as the tyres the course comes to bacharach bend which after the first series has been referred to as the penultimate corner or the second-to-last corner and is often regarded as one of the most challenging on the course the final turn before the finish line is gambon in honour of sir michael gambon who completed the turn on two wheels in episode 8 of series 1 prior to this the corner was known as carpenters corner4 usageedit the track is used routinely for the star in a reasonably-priced car and power laps segments on top gear it also serves myriad roles in other portions of the programme especially in testing cars and in challenges when testing cars they are often driven around the airfield by the presenters afterwards they are taken around the test track by the stig to set a lap time occasionally drag races and speed tests are held on the runway cars acquired during challenges must often post lap times driven by either one of the presenters or the stig around the track against either a target time or a time set by the stig in another vehicle during many challenges the track is used in more unorthodox fashions for instance serving as a makeshift motorway lane during a challenge testing tailgating prowess with vans power lapsedit top gear test track power laps is a segment of the programme in which the stig completes a lap around the track in a reviewed car to compare its performance to previous contenders to be eligible to appear on the power lap times board a vehicle must be a road-legal production car and must have sufficient ride height to clear a standard speed bump referred to by the presenters as a sleeping policeman567891011121314 although occasionally vehicles that cannot appear on the list are still timed whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced the time is compared to the official power laps but then removed from the board for example - the ferrari fxx owned by michael schumacher 110.7 was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres all laps are timed with the cars manufacturer-provided adjustable settings configured for maximum performance all adjustable suspensions are set at their most efficient all gear shift maps are at their most aggressive and driving aids such as traction control are deactivated lap times do not offer complete comparisons between the cars mainly because wet or otherwise poor weather conditions see time deductions below can negatively affect lap times the power boardedit main article list of top gear test track power lap times time vehicle episode 0113.7 mclaren 675lt series 23 episode 2 0113.8 pagani huayra series 19

non-qualifying vehicle is one that does not meet the presenters requirements to remain on the board that is one that is not a road car which according to top gear means being available to buy fully

chose to run a lap of the dunsfold circuit is not stated although it is noticeable that the slower official caterham run was limited by cold tyres celebrity lapsedit star in a reasonably priced car series 1-22edit star in a reasonably priced car was a recurring segment on top gear during most programmes a celebrity usually but not exclusively of british fame is interviewed by jeremy clarkson discussion is normally amusing and focuses on car-related matters such as the celebritys car history then clarkson and the studio audience watch the guests fastest lap on the top gear test track after which clarkson puts the celebritys time on the time board suzuki liana 20022005edit top gears suzuki liana for the first seven series the car driven for lap times was a suzuki liana when first introduced the car was worth 9995.28 the car used is stock except for a roll cage and racing seats added as safety measures each guest practises with the stig before making several attempts to complete the test track in the fastest time the guest does not learn their time until the interview practice laps crashes and the drivers facial expressions are also shown during the segment the two slowest laps on the liana celebrity list are held by terry wogan and richard whiteley both of whom were beaten by billy baxter a bosnian war veteran who is completely blind he guided the liana through the track under direction from clarkson in the passenger seat in a time of 2 minutes 2 seconds which was 1.4 seconds quicker than terry wogan and 4 seconds faster than richard whiteley the fastest non-professional driver was ellen macarthur unlike most contenders she made no comments to the camera during her lap she completed the lap in 1 minute 46.7 seconds beating jimmy carr by 0.2 seconds the current fastest professional driver in the liana is daniel ricciardo with 142.2 the liana endured considerable abuse from the stars while undertaking their laps in one incident actor michael gambon clipped the final corner taking the car onto two wheels it was done in such a spectacular fashion that the corner was named gambon corner when lionel richie drove the liana one of the front wheels fell off invoking clarkson to coin the term pulling a lionel trevor eve also lost a wheel the former british transport minister stephen ladyman added further injury to the liana by denting the boot when he lost control during practice and slid backwards into a tyre wall david soul destroyed the gearbox of two lianas during his time on the show due to his rough driving style patrick kielty broke the lianas front suspension during series 4 when he drove on the grass christopher eccleston was the only celebrity to use a liana with an automatic transmission because a hesitant eccleston admitted he was only qualified to drive an automatic to accommodate his needs top gear succeeded in borrowing an automatic liana of which only 40 existed in the uk as a reference to his role in doctor who the automatic liana was shown materialising onto the racing track with a tardis materialisation sound effect played over it the liana has also been modified on several occasions david souls liana featured a red police light and a white stripe in reference to his starsky and hutch role johnny vegas was provided with l-plates as he had not passed his driving test at the time when justin hawkins came on the show the liana he drove had flame decals pasted on it actor sanjeev bhaskar had an ornate tissue box placed in the back an homage to indian drivers in its service the liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit went through 400 tyres its brakes were changed 100 times and it required six new clutches two new hubs driveshafts wishbones struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror29 in july 2005 formula one driver damon hill appeared on the show for the first time as the star this was kept a surprise to the audience and the viewing public and when nigel mansell came on the show it was covered up in magazines and on the internet by saying that the star in a reasonably priced car would be alan titchmarsh since mansells appearance the liana has remained in use as a vehicle reserved for formula 1 drivers for some of the laps more than one person has been present in the car this was the case for clarksons run when he had both hammond and jason dawe in the car trinny and susannah were both in the car for each others runs denise van outen was in the car when johnny vaughan did his lap van outen never did a lap driving the car clarkson was also present as a

that each star would have five practice laps and then a final timed lap with no allowance being given for mishaps as a starter for the new car and format an open day was held for any celebrity who wanted to take part seven stars recorded times that day james hewitt who jeremy and richard referred to as the well spoken man after failing to recognise him comedians alan davies and jimmy carr rock stars rick wakeman and justin hawkins footballer les ferdinand and actor trevor eve who topped the time at 1 minute 47.0 seconds jimmy carr who held second place in the liana behind ellen macarthur spun off while doing his timed lap and got the second to one slowest time ever around the track at 2 minutes 8.91 seconds on 28 january 2007 jamie oliver posted a time of 147.70 in melted snow and standing water given the rivalry oliver felt towards fellow celebrity chef and then-lapboard leader gordon ramsay oliver asked that the 4-second allowance normally granted for wet laps be used to put him at the top of the leaderboard just for a day actress billie piper posted a time of 148.3 but was deemed by the stig to have failed to complete a lap properly as she failed to negotiate some corners the stig suggested a three-second time penalty but after clarkson consulted the audience it was decided to let the time stand which her doctor who co-star david tennant tried to overturn on 23 december 2007 show at the end of the following series clarkson remarked that if tennant had worn a see through top like piper for her interview he would have been faster than simon cowell in the 11 november 2007 episode simon cowell retook his status as the holder of the fastest lap with a time of 145.90 according to clarkson the cameramen said they had never seen such consistency in the practice laps32 however cowell was knocked off the top spot in series 11 by jay kay who now holds the fastest time in the lacetti although clarkson selected the fastest of jay kays times rather than the last run which was slower than cowells time seemingly due to a dislike of cowell he claimed earlier in the episode that cowell had been at the top of the leaderboard for too long had this not happened cowell would have been knocked off the top by grand designs host kevin mccloud clarkson has referred to the part of the board with times of 151 and over as the thespian zone due to the propensity for classically trained actors to post slow times series 11 featured a slight change to the format with two stars per episode instead of the previous one although there had been a couple of editions in previous series with more than one guest each of the pair are professionally associated with their fellow guest usually both either act in or present the same tv show unlike previous episodes where two stars have appeared the stars drove individual laps without the other present in the car on 28 march 2010 richard hammond attended the demolition of the two 550ft chimneys at

formula one drivers are put into their own list with regard to lap times because of their exceptional skill level when the liana was pulled out from retirement to allow jenson button to make a time clarkson noted that the liana would be pulled out for use by formula 1 drivers in the future the original black stig and the first white stig have done laps around the track in the suzuki liana both had their times removed from the leaderboard upon their departure the first stig was perry mccarthy who once test drove for the williams f1 team and drove for the ill-fated andrea moda formula one team36 the second stig was ben collins in the first episode of series 13 the stig was revealed to be michael schumacher although this was a joke in the vein of the rest of his appearance on the show on 6 july 2011 sebastian vettel managed to top the board with a time of 144.0 vettels lap was the first time someone taking a formula one drivers line through the first corner was able to top the stigs time as rubens barrichello took the tighter line clarkson also mentioned on this episode that the current stig has yet to do a lap of the track in the liana therefore there is currently no time on the board for the stig on 17 february 2013 lewis hamilton returned to do a dry lap and lowered the f1 drivers record by 1.1s to 142.9 this was in the wake of his move to mercedes amg for the 2013
