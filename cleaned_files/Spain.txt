evidence down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses lady of elche the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis meaning city of the western world jess luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy meaning to forge metals therefore i-spn-ya would mean the land where metals are forged9 it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania meaning island of rabbits land of rabbits or edge a reference to spains location at the end of the mediterranean roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet10 and strabo called it the land of the rabbits11 hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia reflecting the greek perception of italy as a western land or land of the setting sun hesperia in greek and spain being still further west as hesperia ultima12 there is the claim that hispania derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning edge or border another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent12 two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars don isaac abrabanel and solomon ibn verga gave an explanation now considered folkloric both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem this man was a grecian by birth but who had been given a kingdom in spain he became related by marriage to espan the nephew of king heracles who also ruled over a kingdom in spain heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece leaving his kingdom to his

the rule of the roman empire during the early middle ages it came under germanic rule but later much of it was conquered by moorish invaders from north africa in a process that took centuries the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula the last moorish kingdom fell in the same year columbus reached the americas a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe the leading world power for a century and a half and the largest overseas empire for three centuries continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable prior to the second world war spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy

to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon1417 archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula from the northeast to the southeast the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula from the northwest to the southwest basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees

hispania began in 409 when the germanic suebi and vandals together with the sarmatian alans crossed the rhine and ravaged gaul until the visigoths drove them into iberia that same year the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal as the western empire disintegrated the social and economic base became greatly simplified but even in modified form the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture the alans allies the hasdingi vandals established a kingdom in gallaecia too occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the douro river the silingi vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their

islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed christian gains basilica of san isidoro len the reconquista reconquest was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula the christian armys victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains shortly after in 739

americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations the rise of humanism the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries

unrelenting challenges from all sides barbary pirates under the aegis of the rapidly growing ottoman empire disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an islamic invasion38 this was at a time when spain was often at war with france the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean39 by the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century europe the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640 and the netherlands and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive europe-wide thirty years war40 the family of philip v 1743 during the enlightenment in spain a new royal family reigned the house of bourbon in the latter half of the 17th century spain went into a gradual decline during which it surrendered several small territories to france and the netherlands however it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent41 during this war a new dynasty originating in france the bourbons was installed long united only by the crown a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king philip v united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws42 the 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdoms elite and monarchy military assistance for the

independence and spanishamerican war the third of may 1808 by francisco de goya depicts an episode of the spanish independence war in 1793 spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola the prime minister manuel godoy then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805 in 1807 a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal napoleons troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spains major fortresses the ridiculed spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleons brother joseph bonaparte joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime44 these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime45 napoleon was forced to intervene personally defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat however further military action by spanish armies guerrillas and wellingtons british-portuguese forces combined with napoleons disastrous invasion of russia led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814 and the return of king ferdinand vii46 during the war in 1810 a revolutionary body the cortes of cdiz was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution47 it met as one body and its members represented the entire spanish empire48 in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries the proclamation of the spanish constitution of 1812 in cdiz spains conquest by france benefited latin american anti-colonialists who resented the imperial spanish governments policies that favoured spanish-born citizens peninsulars over those born overseas criollos and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people starting in 1809 spains american colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence leading to the spanish american wars of independence that ended spanish control over its mainland colonies in the americas king ferdinand viis attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in spain and army revolts followed led by liberal officers by the end of 1826 the only american colonies spain held were cuba and puerto rico the napoleonic war left spain economically ruined deeply divided and politically unstable in the 1830s and 1840s anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the carlist wars liberal forces won but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period after the glorious revolution of 1868 and the short-lived first spanish republic a more stable monarchic period began

cuba in 1895 and 1896 the cuban war of independence and the philippine revolution broke out and eventually the united states became involved the spanishamerican war was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of north africa el desastre the disaster as the war became known in spain gave added impetus to the generation of 98 who

the party was renamed the national movement movimiento nacional in 1949 after world war ii spain was politically and economically isolated and was kept out of the united nations this changed in 1955

mediterranean basin in the 1960s spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the

recognises historic entitiesnationalities a carefully chosen word to avoid the more politically charged nationsand regions within the context of the spanish nation for some people spains identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole spanish identity indeed some of the regional identities may even conflict with the spanish one distinct traditional regional identities within spain include the basques catalans galicians andalusians and valencians140 although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities will claim a distinct historic identity it is this last feature of shared identity between the more local level or autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal minority groups spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies especially latin america and north africa smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants most of whom are of middle eastern south asian and chinese origin the single largest group of immigrants are european represented by large numbers of britons germans french and others141 ceuta and melilla have a big population of north african ancestry the arrival of the gitanos a romani people began in the 16th century estimates of the spanish gitano population range from 750,000 to over one million142143144145146 there are also the mercheros also quinquis a formerly nomadic minority group their origin is unclear historically sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture147 the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews148 immigration main article immigration to spain marbella mlaga where britonswho are the third biggest immigrant community in spainreside in large numbers according to the spanish

migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain principally senegaleses and nigerians150 since 2000 spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants particularly those arriving illegally by sea has caused noticeable social tension151 palma de mallorca where a large population of germans live within the eu spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus but by a great margin the highest in absolute numbers up to 2008.152 the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 out of a total population of 46million.153154 in 2005 alone a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people155 there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration including spains cultural ties with latin america its geographical position the porosity of its borders the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spains mediterranean coast in fact spain was europes largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007 with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5million people arrived156 in 2008 prior to the onset of the economic crisis the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu157 in 2008 the government instituted a plan of voluntary return which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security158 the programme had little effect during its first two months just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer159 what the programme failed to do the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs in 2011 alone more than half a million people left spain160 for

from morocco and other african countries more than 514,000 30 of them had spanish nationality176 the recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of hindus buddhists sikhs and muslims after the reconquista in 1492 muslims did not live in spain for centuries late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in spanish morocco and western sahara full citizenship their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration especially from morocco and algeria judaism was practically non-existent in spain from the 1492 expulsion until the

realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society as they were in the spirit of general realism realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences instead of romanticised or stylised presentations the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spains fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898 which provoked a cultural crisis in spain the disaster of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political economic and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo for a group of younger writers among them miguel de unamuno po baroja and jos martnez ruiz azorn the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper more radical literary shift that affected both form and content these writers along with ramn del valle-incln antonio machado ramiro de maeztu and ngel ganivet came to be known as the generation of 98 miguel de unamuno jos ortega y gasset and federico garca lorca the generation of 1914 or novecentismo the next supposed generation of spanish writers following those of 98 already calls into question the value of such terminology by the year

eugeni dors clara campoamor and ortega y gasset and the novelists gabriel mir ramn prez de ayala and ramn gmez de la serna while still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of 98 they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity salvador de madariaga another prominent intellectual and writer was one of the founders of the college of europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the liberal international the generation of 1927 where poets pedro salinas jorge guilln federico garca lorca vicente aleixandre dmaso alonso all were scholars of their national literary heritage again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish intelligence to turn at least partially
