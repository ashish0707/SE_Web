derived by measuring from the top of a 1.2m 4ft platform at the base13 ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the man-made structure and is above the level of the surrounding pavement13151416 taipei 101 displaced the petronas towers as the tallest building in the world by 57.3m 188ft.1520 the record it claimed for

the shanghai world financial center in 2008 which in turn yielded these records as well to the burj1315 structural designedit location of taipei 101s largest tuned mass damper tuned mass damper taipei 101 is designed to withstand the typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei 101 to withstand gale winds of 60 metres per second 197fts 216kmh or 134mph as well as the strongest earthquakes in a 2,500-year cycle21 taipei 101 was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort for the occupants and for the protection of glass curtain walls and other features22 most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei 101 combined with the surrounding areas geology the building is located just 660 feet away from a major fault line 23 taipei 101 used high-performance steel construction and 36 columns including eight mega-columns packed with 10,000psi 69mpa concrete24 outrigger trusses located at eight-floor intervals connect the columns in the buildings core to those on the exterior25 these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei 101 one of the most stable buildings ever constructed the foundation is reinforced by 380 piles driven 80m 262ft into the ground extending as far as 30m 98ft into the bedrock each pile is 1.5m 5ft in diameter and can bear a load of 1,0001,320 tonnes 1,1001,460 short tons24 during construction on 31 march 2002 a 6.8-magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the 56th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed25 rwdi designed a 660-tonne 728-short-ton262728 steel pendulum that

the largest damper sphere in the world consists of 41 circular steel plates of varying diameters each 125mm 4.92in thick welded together to form a 5.5m 18ft diameter sphere two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing 6 tonnes 7 short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads2930 on 8 august 2015 strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by 100 centimetres 39in the largest movement ever recorded by the damper31 the damper has become such a hot tourist attraction the city contracted sanrio to create a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby rich gold cool black smart silver and lucky red were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei 101 gift shops damper

ruyi figure over one of the buildings entrances shadow of the tower in the late afternoon the adjoining park circular feature bottom acts as the face of a sundial feng shui fountain outside taipei 101 taipei 101s characteristic blue-green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by 50 percent and can sustain impacts of 7 tonnes 8 short tons21 the faade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined moment-resisting lattices contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega-columns with one-story high trusses at every eighth floor this faade system is therefore able to withstand up to 95mm 4in of seismic lateral displacements without damage35 the original corners of the faade were tested at rwdi in ontario a simulation of a 100-year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a 3-second 105 miles per hour 169kmh wind at a height of 10 meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final designs double stairstep corner faade36 architect cy lee also used extensive faade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these faade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two faade sections among others37 taipei 101s own roof and faade recycled water system meets 20 to 30 percent of the buildings water needs in july 2011 taipei 101 was certified the worlds tallest green building under leed standards38 symbolismedit taipei 101 in the skyline the height of 101 floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built 1001 and all the new years that follow 1 january 1-01 it symbolizes high ideals by going one better on 100 a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology24 the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese-speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune3940 the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the buildings shape to a stack of take-out boxes as used in western-style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes41 the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals 1-0-1.24 the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei 101 is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights4243 the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians43 each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei 101 tower stands at least 8m 26ft tall44 at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei 101 in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from 600 to 1000 each evening45 the towers lights display one of seven colours in the spectrum the colors coincide with the days of the week46 day monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday color red orange yellow green blue violet purple the adjoining taipei 101 on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the buildings occupants the parks design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the buildings wind shear47 taipei 101 like many of its neighbours shows the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the towers east entrance48 a ball at the fountains top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the towers rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or chi from a structure and its occupants4950 placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of chi5152 interioredit taipei 101 is the first record-setting skyscraper to be constructed in the 21st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for

building it wasnt until the summer of 2001 that the city granted a license for the construction of a 101-story tower on the site in the meantime construction proceeded and the first tower column was erected in the summer of 2000.259 a major earthquake took place in taiwan during 31 march 2002 destroying a construction crane at the roof top which was at floor number 47 the crane fell down onto the
