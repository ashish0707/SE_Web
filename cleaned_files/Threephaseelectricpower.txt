it has been suggested that phase sequence be merged into this article discuss proposed since october 2016 three-phase transformer with four wire output for 208y120 volt service one wire for neutral others for a b and c phases three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation transmission and distribution1 it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads a three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit electrical power2 the three-phase system was independently invented by galileo ferraris mikhail

to the right the phase order is 123 this cycle repeats with the frequency of the power system three-phase electric power transmission lines three phase transformer bkscsaba hungary left primary wires right the secondary wires in a symmetric three-phase power supply system three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period the common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral due to the phase difference the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor this phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load it also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers for instance a two phase system using a scott-t transformer the symmetric threephase systems described here are simply referred to as threephase systems because although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric threephase power systems ie with unequal voltages or phase shifts they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems in a threephase system feeding a balanced and linear load the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero in other words the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two but with the opposite sign the return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors advantagesedit as compared to a single-phase ac power supply that uses two conductors phase and neutral a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires ie three instead of two thus the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled the same ratio of capacity to conductor material can also be attained with a center-grounded single-phase system3 three-phase systems may also utilize a fourth wire particularly in low-voltage distribution this is the neutral wire the neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each single-phase loads the connections are arranged so that as far as possible in each group equal power is drawn from each phase further up the distribution system the currents are usually well balanced transformers may be wired in a way that they have a fourwire secondary but a threewire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondaryside neutral currents three-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems the phase currents tend to cancel out one another summing to zero in the case of a linear balanced load this makes it possible to reduce the size of the neutral conductor because it carries little or no current with a balanced load all the phase conductors carry the same current and so can be the same size power transfer into a linear balanced load is constant which helps to reduce generator and motor vibrations three-phase systems can produce a rotating magnetic field with a specified direction and constant magnitude which simplifies the design of electric motors most household loads are single-phase in north american residences three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block but the household loads are connected only as single phase in lower-density areas only a single phase might be used for distribution some large european appliances may be powered by three-phase power such as electric stoves and clothes dryers phase sequenceedit wiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors for example pumps and fans may not work in reverse maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit generation and distributionedit see also mains electricity by country animation of three-phase current flow left elementary six-wire three-phase alternator with each phase using a separate pair of transmission wires4 right elementary three-wire three-phase alternator showing how the phases can share only three wires5 at the power station an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three ac electric currents one from each coil or winding of the generator the windings are arranged such that the currents vary sinusoidally at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle 120 or 23 radians the generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 hz varying by country at the power station transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission minimizing losses after further voltage conversions in the transmission network the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers most automotive alternators generate three phase ac and rectify it to dc with a diode bridge6 transformer connectionsedit a delta connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system a wye star transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point in an open delta or v system only two transformers are used a closed delta system can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed7 in open delta each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase therefore capacity is reduced to 87 with one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87 efficiency the capacity is 58 23 87.89 where a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages a grounding transformer usually a zigzag transformer may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground another variation is a corner grounded delta system which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers10 three-wire and four-wire circuitsedit wye y and delta circuits there are two basic three-phase configurations delta and wye star as shown in the diagram a delta configuration requires only 3 wires for transmission but a wye star configuration may utilise a fourth wire the fourth wire if present is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded the 3-wire and 4-wire designations do not count the ground wire used above many transmission lines which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under non-fault conditions a four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the common star point of all supply windings in such a system all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral other non-symmetrical systems have been used the four-wire wye system is used when ground referenced voltages or the flexibility of more voltage selections are required faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event fuse or breaker open locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipmentcitation needed an example of application is local distribution in europe and elsewhere where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral which is common to the three phases when a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced as much as possible within premises where 3-phase power is utilized11 these same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises hence every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that on average as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply for domestic use some countries such as the uk may supply one phase and neutral at a high current up to 100a to one property while others such as germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer but at a lower fuse rating typically 32 a per phase and shuffled to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phasecitation needed a transformer for a high-leg delta system assuming a 200 v 3-phase supply 200 v 3-phase motors would be connected to l1 l2 and l3 200 v single-phase load would be connected between l1 and l2 single-phase 100 v supplies 180 degrees out of phase would be obtained between either l1 or l2 and the neutral n l3 wild or high leg will be 173.2 v with respect to the neutral in north america a high-leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram this setup produces three different voltages if the voltage between the center tap neutral and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 v 100 the voltage across any two phases is 240 v 200 and the neutral to high leg voltage is 208 v 173.7 the reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field however the premises concerned will also require the normal north american 120 v supplies two of which are derived 180 degrees out of phase between the neutral and either of the center tapped phase points balanced circuitsedit in the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads in a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other

connected across any two phases or a load can be connected from phase to neutral13 distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers in a symmetrical three-phase four-wire wye system the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral the voltage between line conductors is 3 times the phase conductor to neutral voltage14 v ll 3 v ln  displaystyle v_textllsqrt 3v_textln the currents returning from the customers premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire if the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently if the supply neutral is broken phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage up to the phase-to-phase voltage a high-leg delta provides phase-to-neutral relationship of vll 2vln however ln load is imposed on one phase7 a transformer manufacturers page suggests that ln loading not exceed 5 of transformer capacity15 since 3 1.73 defining vln as 100 gives vll 100 1.73 173 if vll was set as 100 then vln 57.7 unbalanced loadsedit when the currents on the three live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120 phase angle the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system the method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems non-linear loadsedit with linear loads the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as switch-mode power supplies computers office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase on all the supply phases consequently such harmonic currents add in the neutral which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current1316 three-phase loadsedit an important class of three-phase load is the electric motor a three-phase induction motor has a simple design inherently high starting torque and high efficiency such motors are applied in industry for many applications a three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating and single-phase ac motors above 10 hp 7.5kw are uncommon three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions resistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems electric lighting may also be similarly connected line frequency flicker in light can be reduced by evenly spreading three phases across line frequency operated light sources so that illuminated area is provided light from all three phases the effect of line frequency flicker is detrimental to super slow motion cameras used in sports event broadcasting three phase lighting has been applied successfully at the 2008 beijing olympics to provide consistent light level for each frame17 rectifiers may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse dc output18 the output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and unlike single-phase does not drop to zero between pulses such rectifiers may be used for battery charging electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of dc motors zig-zag transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification twelve pulses per cycle and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components while improving the quality of the resulting dc one example of a three-phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores in many european countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed however the individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit eg if within an older domestic property a three-phase feed is not yet available19 other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters however since those references appeared homes in europe and the uk have standardized on a supply with a nominal 230 v between any phase and ground in practice existing supplies remain nearer 240 v in the uk and 220v on much of the continent only new work is 230v most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection although domestic appliances are invariably designed to be able to work with a single-phase supply phase convertersedit phase converters are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source they are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied resynthesis allowing speed control some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive20 mechanicaledit one method to generate three-phase power from a single-phase source is the rotary phase converter essentially a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages when properly designed these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source in such a device the energy storage is performed by the inertia flywheel effect of the rotating components an external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft a three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor this motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion but requires two machines with all their expense and losses the motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered dc motor for really constant power a standby generator set gives more frequency drop until standby generator kicks in non-mechanicaledit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged

expensive than transformers so an autotransformer was used to apply more power through fewer capacitors separated it from another common method the static converter as both methods have no moving parts which separates them from the rotary converters another method often attempted is with a device referred to as a static phase converter this method of running three-phase equipment is commonly attempted with motor loads though it only supplies 23 power and can cause the motor loads to run hot and in some cases overheat this method does not work when sensitive circuitry is involved such as cnc devices or in induction and rectifier-type loads variable-frequency drives also known as solid-state inverters and adjustable speed drives are used to provide precise speed and torque control of three-phase motors some models can be powered by a single-phase supply vfds work by converting the supply voltage to dc and then converting the dc to a suitable three-phase source for the motor digital phase converters are designed for fixed-frequency operation from a single-phase source similar to a variable-frequency drive they use a microprocessor to control solid-state power switching components to maintain balanced three-phase voltages alternatives to three-phaseedit split-phase electric power is used when three-phase power is not available and allows double the normal utilization voltage to be supplied for high-power loads two-phase electric power like three-phase gives constant power transfer to a linear load for loads that connect each phase to neutral assuming the load is the same power draw the two-wire system has a neutral current that is greater than neutral current in a three-phase system also motors are not entirely linear which means that despite the theory motors running on three-phase tend to run smoother than those on two-phase the generators in the adams power plant at niagara falls that were installed in 1895 were the largest generators in the world at the time and were two-phase machines true two-phase power distribution is obsolete for new work applications but still exists for old work applications perhaps most particularly in buffalo and niagara falls ny toronto and niagara falls ontario philadelphia and reading pa and camden nj new work three-phase installations may be supplied by old two-phase feeders and old work two-phase installations may be supplied by new three-phase feeders using a scott-t transformer invented by charles f scott21 special-purpose systems may use a two-phase system for frequency control monocyclic power was a name for an asymmetrical modified two-phase power system used by general electric around 1897 championed by charles proteus steinmetz and elihu thomson this system was devised to avoid patent infringement in this system a generator was wound with a full-voltage single-phase winding intended for lighting loads and with a small fraction usually 14 of the line voltage winding that produced a voltage in quadrature with the main windings the intention was to use this power wire additional winding to provide starting torque for induction motors with the main winding providing power for lighting loads after the expiration of the westinghouse patents on symmetrical two-phase and three-phase power distribution systems the monocyclic system fell out of use it was difficult to analyze and did not last long enough for satisfactory energy metering to be developed high-phase-order systems for power transmission have been built and tested such transmission lines typically would use six phases or twelve phases high-phase-order transmission lines allow transfer of slightly less than proportionately higher power through a given volume without the expense of a high-voltage direct current hvdc converter at each end of the line however they require correspondingly more pieces of equipment color codesedit see also electrical wiring colour code conductors of a three-phase
