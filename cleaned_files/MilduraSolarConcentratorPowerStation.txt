by up to 30 this is because it tracks the sun and operates at lower temperatures10 previous projectsedit the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia with support from the australian greenhouse office11 see alsoedit renewable energy portal australia portal solar power in australia energy policy of australia referencesedit mildura presentation march 2011 pdf silex systems limited march 2011 retrieved 2011-07-11 22 may 2010 australia advances with solar power environmentcoza retrieved on 28 september 2012 sophie vorrath australias largest concentrated solar power plant officially launched 18 july 2013 a b tom arup sunraysias huge solar farm up and running in the age 17 july 2013 silex shelves major solar plant on ret uncertainty abc 19 august 2014 retrieved 21 august 2014 biggest solar project falls as australia may cut renewables chicago tribune 18 august 2014 retrieved 21 august 2014 lawrence bartlett worlds biggest solar plant for australia in cosmons 26 october 2006 chee chee leung brumby planning to plug victoria into the sun in the age 17 june 2008 solar systems facts sheet -- the technology solar systems -- the technology solar systems retrieved on 28 september 2012 world-leading australian solar technology for export under ap6 solar systems retrieved on 28 september 2012 v t e energy in victoria coal-fired power stations hazelwood loy yang yallourn gas-fired power stations bairnsdale jeeralang laverton north longford mortlake somerton newport valley power hydroelectric banimboola blue rock dartmouth eildon eildon pondage mckay creek kiewa scheme rubicon scheme william hovell yarrawonga weir wind farms challicum hills macarthur mount mercer portland waubra list of wind farms solar concentrator proposed mildura bendigo shepparton cogeneration symex cogeneration project victoria harbour cogeneration project geothermal portland geothermal facility distributors inner melbourne citipower western suburbs western victoria powercor australia easternnortheastern suburbs eastern victoria ausnet services northwestern suburbs jemena southeastern suburbs mornington peninsula united energy retailers agl energy alinta energy australian power and gas click energy country energy dodo power gas energyaustralia lumo energy momentum energy neighbourhood energy origin energy powerdirect powershop red energy simply energy generators pacific hydro solar systems regulators essential services commission australian energy market operator australian energy market commission australian energy regulator historical decommissioned power stations defunct utility companies state electricity commission gas and fuel corporation victorian power exchange nemmco vencorp list of power stations in victoria
