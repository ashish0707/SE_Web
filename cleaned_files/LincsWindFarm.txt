energy and siemens project ventures jointly acquired 50 of the project 25 share each for 50million plus 50 of the capital cost of the project3 preparatory construction work for the development included the extension of the national-grid electricity substation at walpole norfolk which began in april 2009.4note 1 in june 2010 siemens obtained the contract for the offshore electrical substation 101million.7 transmission cables from offshore to onshore electrical substations were installed in 20102011.48 construction of the offshore facilities of the wind farm began in 2011 with the installation of the offshore electricity substation foundations9 the port of hull was selected as one of the logistics bases for the wind farm turbine installation supplying wind tower transition pieces jack-up barge jb114 arriving at the port in march 2012.10 great yarmouth was also used as a base for the wind farm installation11 construction of the offshore 33kv to 132kv substation structure sub-contracted to mcnulty offshore constructionatkins plc12 and of the onshore 132kv to 400kv substation was completed by april 2012.13 in august 2011 the consortia of dong siemens and centrica began to seek financing for the 1billion project committing to providing 166.7 75 and 333.3million respectively 575million total in june 2012 the consortia obtained financing for the project with 425million of nonrecourse debt facilities provided from a consortium of 10 banks approximately 75 of the project cost was for the wind farm installation the remainder for the high voltage electricity transmission link14 construction began in 2010 installation of the 75-monopile tower foundation by mt hjgaard was completed by june 2012 with the underwater installation phase completed by september 2012.15 the first generator had been installed by 14 july 2012.16 the wind farm was scheduled become operational in the second half of 2012 and be complete by 201317 the final turbine was installed by march 201318 and the wind farm officially opened by deputy prime minister nick clegg in august 2013,1920 with commissioning complete in september 2013.21 the license for the electrical transmission link was awarded to tc lincs ofto limited for 308million in late 2014.22 technical descriptionedit the scheme has 250mw of generating capacity with an additional 20mw of turbine generating capacity constructed within the nearby lynn wind farm and dowsing wind farm but connected to the lincs project transmission system23 the project uses 75 three blade 3.6mw siemens wind turbines the wind turbines have 120 metres 390ft rotor diameter machines with 58.5 metres 192ft blades with a hub height of 100 metres 330ft on cylindrical steel towers the turbines were installed in 10 to 15 metres 33 to 49ft water depth with a spacing of approximately 500 metres 1,600ft within a 35 square kilometres 14sqmi wind farm8 transmission of electrical power to land is by 145kv cables supplied by nexans transmission voltage is 132kv to land being increased to 400kv at walpole substation for grid connection8 the operation and maintenance base for the wind farm is be based at grimsby24 the wind farm has an expected lifespan of 40 years with electrical equipment and wind turbines expected to be replaced after 20 years after the end of the projects lifespan the farm is to be decommissioned including removal of turbines and electrical equipment and removal of offshore foundations or cut off to seabed level or lower connecting cables are not scheduled to be removed25 see alsoedit list of
