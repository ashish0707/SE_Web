2001 15 years ago2001-10-2423 currentstatus active writtenin c perl the wayback machine is a digital archive of the world wide web and other information on the internet created by the internet archive a nonprofit organization based in san francisco california united states the internet archive launched the wayback machine in october 2001.45 it was set up by brewster kahle and bruce gilliat and is maintained with content from alexa internet the service enables users to see archived versions of web pages across time which the archive calls a three dimensional index since 1996 the wayback machine has been archiving cached pages of websites onto its large cluster of linux nodes it revisits sites every few weeks or months and archives a new version sites can also be captured on the fly by visitors who enter the sites url into a search box the intent is to capture and archive content that otherwise would be lost whenever a site is changed or closed down the grand vision of the machines creators is to archive the entire internet6 the name wayback machine was chosen as a droll reference to a plot device in an animated cartoon the rocky and bullwinkle show in one of the animated cartoons component segments peabodys improbable history lead characters mr peabody and sherman routinely used a time machine called the wabac machine pronounced way-back to witness participate in and

accessible world wide web pages the gopher hierarchy the netnews usenet bulletin board system and downloadable software9 the information collected by these crawlers does not include all the information available on the internet since much of the data is restricted by the publisher or stored in databases that are not accessible these crawlers also respect the robots exclusion standard for websites whose owners opt for them not to appear in search results or be cached to overcome inconsistencies in partially cached websites archive-itorg was developed in 2005 by the internet archive as a means of allowing institutions and content creators to voluntarily harvest and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives information had been kept on digital tape for five years with kahle occasionally allowing researchers and scientists to tap into the clunky database10 when the archive reached its fifth anniversary it was unveiled and opened to the public in a ceremony at the university of california berkeley snapshots usually become available more than six months after they are archived or in some cases even later it can take twenty-four months or longer11 the frequency of snapshots is variable so not all tracked website updates are recorded sometimes there are intervals of several weeks or years between snapshots after august 2008 sites had to be listed on the open directory in order to be included12 according to jeff kaplan of the internet archive in november 2010 other sites were still being archived13 but more recent captures would become visible only after the next major indexing an infrequent operation storage capabilitiesedit as of 2009update the wayback machine contained approximately three petabytes of data and was growing at a rate of 100 terabytes each month14 the growth rate reported in 2003 was 12 terabytesmonth the data is stored on petabox rack systems manufactured by capricorn technologies15 in 2009 the internet archive migrated its customized storage architecture to sun open storage and hosts a new data center in a sun modular datacenter on sun microsystems california campus16 in 2011 a new improved version of the wayback machine with an updated interface and fresher index of archived content was made available for public testing17 in march 2011 it was said on the wayback machine forum that the beta of the new wayback machine has a more complete and up-to-date index of all crawled materials into 2010 and will continue to be updated regularly the index driving the classic wayback machine only has a little bit of material past 2008 and no further index updates are planned as it will be phased out this year18 in january 2013 the company announced a ground-breaking milestone of 240 billion urls19 in october 2013 the company announced the save a page feature20 which allows any internet user to archive the contents of a url this became a threat of abuse by the service for hosting malicious

legal evidenceedit civil litigationedit netbula llc v chordiant software incedit in a 2009 case netbula llc v chordiant software inc defendant chordiant filed a motion to compel netbula to disable the robotstxt file on its website that was causing the wayback machine to retroactively remove access to previous versions of pages it had archived from netbulas site pages that chordiant believed would support its case37 netbula objected to the motion on the ground that defendants were asking to alter netbulas website and that they should have subpoenaed internet archive for the pages directly38 an employee of internet archive filed a sworn statement supporting chordiants motion however stating that it could not produce the web pages by any other means without considerable burden expense and disruption to its operations37 magistrate judge howard lloyd in the northern district of california san jose division rejected netbulas arguments and ordered them to disable the robotstxt blockage temporarily in order to allow chordiant to retrieve the archived pages that they sought37 telewizja polskaedit in an october 2004 case telewizja polska usa inc v echostar satellite no 02 c 3293 65 fed r evid serv 673 nd ill oct 15 2004 a litigant attempted to use the wayback machine archives as a source of admissible evidence perhaps for the first time telewizja polska is the provider of tvp polonia and echostar operates the dish network prior to the trial proceedings echostar indicated that it intended to offer wayback machine snapshots as proof of the past content of telewizja polskas website telewizja polska brought a motion in limine to suppress the snapshots on the grounds of hearsay and unauthenticated source but magistrate judge arlander keys rejected telewizja polskas assertion of hearsay and denied tvps motion in limine to exclude the evidence at trial3940 at the trial however district court judge ronald guzman the trial judge overruled magistrate keys findingscitation needed and held that neither the affidavit of the internet archive employee nor the underlying pages ie the telewizja polska website were admissible as evidence judge guzman reasoned that the employees affidavit contained both hearsay and inconclusive supporting statements and the purported web page printouts were not self-authenticatingcitation needed patent lawedit main article internet as a source of prior art provided some additional requirements are met eg providing an authoritative statement of the archivist the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application41 limitations of utilityedit there are technical limitations to archiving a website and as a consequence it is possible for opposing parties in litigation to misuse the results provided by website archives this problem can be exacerbated by the practice of submitting screen shots of web pages in complaints answers or expert witness reports when the underlying links are not exposed and therefore can contain errors for example archives such as the wayback machine do not fill out forms and therefore do not include the contents of non-restful e-commerce databases in their archives42 legal statusedit in europe the wayback machine could be interpreted as violating copyright laws only the content creator can decide where their content is published or duplicated so the archive would have to delete pages from its system upon request of the creator43 the exclusion policies for the wayback machine may be found in the faq section of the site the wayback machine also retroactively respects robotstxt files ie pages that currently are blocked to robots on the live web temporarily will be made unavailable from the archives as well archived content legal issuesedit a number of cases have been brought against the internet archive specifically for its wayback machine archiving efforts scientologyedit see also scientology and the internet in late 2002 the internet archive removed various sites that were critical of scientology from the wayback machine44 an error message stated that this was in response to a request by the site owner45 later it was clarified that lawyers from the church of scientology had demanded the removal and that the site owners did not want their material removed46 healthcare advocates incedit in 2003 harding earley follmer frailey defended a client from a trademark dispute using the archives wayback machine the attorneys were able to demonstrate that the claims made by the plaintiff were invalid based on the content of their website from several years prior the plaintiff healthcare advocates then amended their complaint to include the internet archive accusing the organization of copyright infringement as well as violations of the dmca and the computer fraud and abuse act healthcare advocates claimed that since they had installed a robotstxt file on their website even if after the initial lawsuit was filed the archive should have removed all previous copies of the plaintiff website from the wayback machine47 the lawsuit was settled out of court48 robotstxt is used as part of the robots exclusion standard a voluntary protocol the internet archive respects that disallows bots from indexing certain pages delineated by its creator as off-limits as a result the internet archive has rendered unavailable a number of websites that now are inaccessible through the wayback machine currently the internet archive applies robotstxt rules retroactively if a site blocks the internet archive such as healthcare advocates any previously archived pages from the domain are rendered unavailable as well in cases of blocked sites only the robotstxt file is archived the internet archive states however sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site we comply with these requests49 in addition the website says the internet archive is not interested in preserving or offering access to web sites or other internet documents of persons who do not want their materials in the collection50 suzanne shelledit in december 2005 activist suzanne shell filed suit demanding internet archive pay her us 100,000 for archiving her website profane-justiceorg between 1999 and 2004.5152 internet archive filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california on january 20 2006 seeking a judicial determination that internet archive did not violate shells copyright shell responded and brought a countersuit against internet archive for archiving her site which she alleges is in violation of her terms of service53 on february 13 2007 a judge for the united states district court for the district of colorado dismissed all counterclaims except breach of contract52 the internet archive did not move to dismiss copyright infringement claims shell asserted arising out of its copying activities which would also go forward54 on april 25 2007 internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit51 the internet archive said it has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived we recognize that ms shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation shell said i respect the historical value of internet archives goal i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm55 daniel davydiukedit in 201314 a pornographic actor was trying to remove archived images of himself first by sending multiple dmca requests to the archive and
