of the empire state building was first developed as the john thompson farm in the late 18th century22 at the time a stream ran across the site emptying into sunfish pond located a block away beginning in the late 19th century the block was occupied by the waldorf-astoria hotel23 frequented by the four hundred the social elite of new york the limestone for the empire state building came from the empire mill in sanders indiana which is an unincorporated town adjacent to bloomington indiana the empire mill land office is near state road 37 and old state road 37 just south of bloomington the bloomington bedford and oolitic area is known locally as the limestone capital of the world2425 design and construction a worker bolts beams during construction the chrysler building can be seen in the background the empire state building was designed by william f lamb from the architectural firm shreve lamb and harmon which produced the building drawings in just two weeks using its earlier designs for the reynolds building in winston-salem north carolina and the carew tower in cincinnati ohio designed by the architectural firm w w ahlschlager associates as a basis2627 every year the staff of the empire state building sends a fathers day card to the staff at the reynolds building in winston-salem to pay homage to its role as predecessor to the empire state building28 the building was designed from the top down29 the general contractors were the starrett brothers and eken and the project was financed primarily by john j raskob and pierre s du pont the construction company was chaired by alfred e smith a former governor of new york and james farleys general builders supply corporation supplied the building materials1 john w bowser was project construction superintendent303132 excavation of the site began on january 22 1930 and construction on the building itself started on march 17st patricks dayper al smiths influence as empire state inc president the project involved 3,400 workers mostly immigrants from europe along with hundreds of mohawk iron workers many from the kahnawake reserve near montreal according to official accounts five workers died during the construction33 governor smiths grandchildren cut the ribbon on may 1 1931 lewis wickes hines photography of the construction provides not only invaluable documentation of the construction but also a glimpse into common day life of workers in that era34 the construction was part of an intense competition in new york for the title of worlds tallest building two other projects fighting for the title 40 wall street and the chrysler building were still under construction when work began on the empire state building each held the title for less than a year as the empire state building surpassed them upon its completion on april 11 1931 12 days ahead of schedule just 410days after construction commenced2 the building was officially opened on may 1 1931 in dramatic fashion when united states president herbert hoover turned on the buildings lights with the push of a button from washington dc ironically the first use of tower lights atop the empire state building the following year was for the purpose of signaling the victory of franklin d roosevelt over hoover in the presidential election of november 1932.35 opening view of the building from the north the buildings opening coincided with the great depression in the united states and as a result much of its office space was initially unrented the buildings vacancy was exacerbated by its poor location on 34th street which placed it relatively far from public transportation as grand central terminal and penn station built decades beforehand are several blocks away as is the more recently built port authority bus terminal other more successful skyscrapers such as the chrysler building did not have this problem in its first year of operation the observation deck took in approximately 2million dollars as much money as its owners made in rent that year the lack of renters led new yorkers to deride the building as the empty state building3637 the building only became profitable in 1950 the 1951 sale of the empire state building to roger l stevens and his business partners was brokered by the prominent upper manhattan real-estate firm charles f noyes company for a record 51million at the time that was the highest price paid for a single structure in real-estate history38 incidents a night view from the observatory looking south 1945 plane crash main article b-25 empire state building crash at 940

of a nearby building starting a fire that destroyed a penthouse the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft the resulting fire was extinguished in 40minutes fourteen people were killed in the incident4041 elevator operator betty lou oliver survived a plunge of 75 stories inside an elevator which still stands as the guinness world record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded42 despite the damage and loss of life the building was open for business on many floors on the following monday the crash helped spur the passage of the long-pending federal tort claims act of 1946 as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law allowing people to sue the government for the incident43 a year later another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building44 suicide attempts over the years more than 30 people have attempted suicide most successfully by jumping from the upper parts of the building45 the first suicide occurred even before its completion by a worker who had been laid off the fence around the observatory terrace was put up in 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span46 on december 16 1943 ex-united states

equivalent to 638,247,300 in 2016 long-term forecasting of the life cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the buildings future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations this is particularly evident in the over-design of the buildings electrical system the buildings art deco design is typical of preworld war ii architecture in new york the modernistic stainless steel canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th streets lead to two story-high corridors around the elevator core crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level the elevator core contains 67 elevators16 the lobby is three stories high and features an aluminum relief of the skyscraper without the antenna which was not added to the spire until 1952 the north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created by roy sparkia and rene nemorov in 1963 in time for the 1964 worlds fair which depicts the building as the eighth wonder of the world alongside the traditional seven these panels were eventually moved near a ticketing line for the observation deck until the 1960s the ceilings in the lobby had a shiny art deco mural inspired by both the sky and the machine age until it was covered with ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting because the original murals designed by an artist named leif neandross were damaged reproductions were installed over 50 artists and workers used 15,000 square feet of aluminum and 1,300 square feet of 23-carat gold leaf to re-create the mural renovations to the lobby alluded to original plans for the building replacing the clock over the information desk in the fifth avenue lobby with an anemometer as well as installing two chandeliers originally intended to be part of the building when it first opened60 in 2000 the buildings owners installed a series of paintings by the new york artist kysa johnson in the concourse level in january 2014 the artist filed suit in federal court in new york under the visual artists rights act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist61 the buildings lobbies and common areas received a 550 million renovation in 2009 which included new air conditioning waterproofing and renovating the observation deck moving the gift shop to the 80th floor62 of this 120million was spent in an effort to transform the building into a more energy efficient and eco-friendly structure20 for example the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into superwindows which block heat but pass light air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved 17 million of the projects capital cost immediately partly funding other retrofitting63 receiving a gold leadership in energy and environmental design leed rating in september 2011 the empire state building is the tallest leed certified building in the united states21 lighting at the top of the empire state building features above the 102nd floor on the 102nd floor of the empire state building there is a door with stairs ascending to the 103rd floor64 this was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the buildings spire and has a circular balcony outside65 it is now a hot spot for celebritiescitation needed and an access point to reach the spire for maintenance the room now contains electrical equipment above the 103rd floor there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work the buildings art deco spire was designed to be a mooring mast and depot for dirigibles66 an elevator between the 86th and 102nd floors would carry passengers after they checked in on the 86th floor67 the idea proved impractical and dangerous due to the powerful updrafts caused by the building itself68 as well as the lack of mooring lines tying the other end of the craft to the ground69 the buildings design was expanded to include the mooring mast as part of a competition for the worlds tallest buildingcitation needed a large broadcast tower was added atop the spire in the early 1950s to support the transmission antennas of several television and fm stations until then nbc had exclusive rights to the site and beginning in 1931 built various smaller antennas for their television transmissions66 broadcast stations new york city is the largest media market in the united states since the september 11 attacks nearly all of the citys commercial broadcast stations both television and fm radio have transmitted from the top of the empire state building although a few fm stations are located at the nearby cond nast building most new york city am stations broadcast from sites across the hudson river in new jersey or from other surrounding areas antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the empire state building broadcasting began at the empire state building on december 22 1931 when rca began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire they leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there andin 1934rca was joined by edwin howard armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his fm system from the buildings antenna when armstrong and rca fell out in 1935 and his fm equipment was removed the 85th floor became the home of rcas new york television operations first as experimental station w2xbs channel 1 which eventually became on july 1 1941 commercial station wnbt channel 1 now wnbc-tv channel 4 nbcs fm station weaf-fm now wqht began transmitting from the antenna in 1940 nbc retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the fcc ordered the exclusive deal broken based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the now seven new york-area television stations five licensed to new york city ny one licensed to newark nj and one licensed to secaucus nj to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted construction on a giant tower began other television broadcasters then joined rca at the building on the 83rd 82nd and 81st floors frequently bringing sister fm stations along for the ride multiple transmissions of tv and fm began from the new tower in 1951 in 1965 a separate set of fm antennas was constructed ringing the 103rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna when the world trade center was being constructed it caused serious reception problems for the television stations most of which then moved to the world trade center as soon as it was completed this made it possible to renovate the antenna structure and the transmitter facilities for the benefit of the fm stations remaining there which were soon joined by other fms and uhf tvs moving in from elsewhere in the metropolitan area the destruction of the world trade center necessitated a great deal of shuffling of antennas and transmitter rooms to accommodate the stations moving back uptown as of 2012 the

storm with the tour taking an unexpected route through the subway coney island and fao schwartz among other places after the september 11 attacks in 2001 however the ride was closed and an updated version debuted in mid-2002 with actor kevin bacon as the pilot the new version of the narration attempted to make the attraction more educational and included some minor post-911 patriotic undertones with retrospective footage of the world trade center the new flight also goes haywire but this segment is much shorter than in the original lights in 1964 floodlights were added to illuminate the top of the building at night74 since 1976 the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal and other events such as st patricks day christmas independence day and bastille day after the eightieth birthday and subsequent death of frank sinatra for example the building was bathed in blue light to represent the singers nickname ol blue eyes after the death of actress fay wray king kong in late 2004 the building stood in complete darkness for 15minutes.75 the floodlights bathed the building in red white and blue for several months after the destruction of the world trade center then reverted
