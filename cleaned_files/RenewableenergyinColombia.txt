colombia has 28.1 megawatt installed capacity of renewable energy excluding large hydropower consisting mainly of wind power the country has significant wind and solar resources that remain largely unexploited according to a study by the world banks energy sector management assistance program esmap exploitation of the countrys significant wind potential alone could cover more than the countrys current total energy needs1 contents 1 investment costs 2 hydropower 3 wind 4 solar 5 geothermal 6 biomass 7 references 8 external links investment costsedit investment costs for renewable energy technologies in colombia were estimated in 2005 as follows1 energy source technology cost uskw large hydro reservoir dam 700-1,700 solar pv photovoltaic solar systems 5,000-10,000 wind on shore electricity generation 800-1,200 large scale up to 3,000 small scale pump 1,500-4,000 geothermal electricity generation 3,000-5,000 small scale 1,500-2,500 large scale biomass direct combustion 2,800-5,000 hydropoweredit main article hydroelectric power in colombia with 70 percent of the countrys power generation hydropower is a very important national energy source the total large hydropower potential for colombia is estimated at 93gw with an additional 25gw of small hydropower 20mw windedit the wind regime in colombia is among the best in south america offshore regions of the northern part of colombia such as in the guajira department have been classified with class 7 winds over 10 meters per second ms the only other region in latin america with such high wind power classification is the patagonia region of chile and argentina1 colombia has an estimated theoretical wind power potential of 21 gw just in the guajira departmentenough to generate sufficient power to meet the national demand almost twice over however the country only has an installed capacity of 19.5 mw of wind energy tapping only 0.4 of its theoretical wind potential this capacity is concentrated in a single project the jeprachi wind project developed by empresas pblicas de medelln epm under a carbon finance mechanism arranged by the world bank2 there are several projects under consideration including a 200 mw project in ipapure1 see also wind and wind energy atlas of colombia 2006 in spanish at upme then click on publicaciones then on recientes accessed on september 8 2007 solaredit colombia has significant solar power resources because of its location in the equatorial zone but the country sits in a complex region of the andes where climatic conditions vary the daily average radiation is 4.5 kwhm2 and the area with the best solar resource is the guajira peninsula with 6 kwhm2 of radiation of the 6 mw of solar power installed in colombia equivalent to about 78,000 average-size solar panels 57 percent is distributed in rural applications and 43 percent in communication towers and road signaling solar systems can be very suitable for applications in rural areas where energy demands are dispersed and modest and grid connection is often more costly upme 2005.1 geothermaledit the former colombian institute of electrical energy today ipse and the latin american energy organization have identified three areas with geothermal power potential azufral in nario department where the azufral volcano is located cerro negro-tufio also in nario department near the chiles volcano and paipa located in the cordillera oriental in boyac department1 the potential of the main sources of geothermal power in colombia is summarized below1 area department potential

isabel caldas high cerro espaa caldas high macha huilah high biomassedit colombia has a great biomass power potential from agricultural residues banana coffee pulp and animal waste its annual biomass power potential is estimated to be over 16 gwh which is still less than 0.1 of current electricity production the potential is distributed as follows 11,828 mwhyr from agriculture residues 2,640 mwhyr from bioethanol 698 mwhyr from natural forest residues 658 mwhyr from biodiesel 442 mwhyr from planted forest residues the region of urab in the north of the department of antioquia has approximately 19,000 hectares of banana plantations producing more than 1 million tons annually it has also been estimated that approximately 85,000 toeyr could be produced from the 190 million m3yr of biogas generated from coffee plantations equivalent to 995,000 mwh1 in addition the landfills in the four main cities in colombia bogot medelln cali and barranquilla are estimated to have the potential to provide for an installed capacity of 47 mw 0.3 of current installed capacity1 referencesedit a b c d e f g h i esmap 2007 review of policy framework for increased reliance on renewable energy in
