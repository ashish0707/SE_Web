and a block of computer time on a general electric ge computer for the schools students26 gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest he wrote his first computer program on this machine an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly when he reflected back on that moment he said there was just something neat about the machine27 after the mothers club donation was exhausted he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers one of these systems was a pdp-10 belonging to computer center corporation ccc which banned four lakeside students gates paul allen ric weiland and kent evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time2829 at the end of the ban the four students offered to find bugs in cccs software in exchange for computer time rather than use the system via teletype gates went to cccs offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system including programs in fortran lisp and machine language the arrangement with ccc continued until 1970 when the company went out of business the following year information sciences inc hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol providing them computer time and royalties after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities gates wrote the schools computer program to schedule students in classes he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with a disproportionate number of interesting girls30 he later stated that it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at

harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou39 gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at harvard40 and spent a lot of time using the schools computers gates remained in contact with paul allen and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of 1974.41 the following year saw the release of the mits altair 8800 based on the intel 8080 cpu and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company42 gates dropped out of harvard at this time he had talked this decision over with his parents who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start a company40 microsoft main articles history of microsoft and microsoft basic mits altair 8800 computer with 8-inch 200mm floppy disk system after reading the january 1975 issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair 8800 gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems mits the creators of the new microcomputer to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform43 in reality gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it they merely wanted to gauge mitss interest mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer and then the basic interpreter the demonstration held at mitss offices in albuquerque was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic paul allen was hired into mits44 and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november 1975 they named their partnership micro-soft and had their first office located in albuquerque44 within a year the hyphen was dropped and on november 26 1976 the trade name microsoft was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico44 gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies microsofts altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed in february 1976 gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair hobby market was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce distribute and maintain high-quality software45 this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976 and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems44 the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue washington on january 1 1979.43 during microsofts early years all employees had broad responsibility for the companys business gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well in the first five years gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit46 ibm partnership ibm approached microsoft in july 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer the ibm pc47 the computer company first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter when ibms representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system gates referred them to digital research dri makers of the widely used cpm operating system48 ibms discussions with digital research went poorly and they did not reach a licensing agreement ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system a few weeks later gates proposed using 86-dos qdos an operating system similar to cpm that tim paterson of seattle computer products scp had made for hardware similar to the pc microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent and later the full owner of 86-dos after adapting the operating system for the pc microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a one-time fee of 50,000.49 gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibms system49 they did and the sales of ms-dos made microsoft a major player in the industry50 despite ibms name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer pc magazine asked if gates were the man behind the machine47 and infoworld quoted an expert as stating its gates computer51 gates oversaw microsofts company restructuring on june 25 1981 which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman43 windows microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november 20 1985 and in august the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os2 although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate52 management style bill gates in january 2008 from microsofts founding in 1975 until 2006 gates had primary responsibility for the companys product strategy he aggressively broadened the companys range of products and wherever microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended itcitation needed he gained a reputation for being distant to others as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls53 another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times when they met again a month later gates won or tied every game he had studied the game until he solved it that is a competitor54 as an executive gates met regularly with microsofts senior managers and program managers firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the companys long-term interests at risk5556 he interrupted presentations with such comments thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard57 and why dont you just give up your options and join the peace corps58 the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until hopefully gates was fully convinced57 when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating he was known to remark sarcastically ill do it over the weekend596061 gates was an active software developer in microsofts early history particularly on the companys programming language products but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs-80 model 100,62 but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the companys products60 he remained interested in technical details jerry pournelle wrote in 1985 that when watching gates announcing microsoft excel something else impressed me bill gates likes the program not because its going to make him a lot of money although im sure it will do that but because its a neat hack63 on june 15 2006 gates announced that he would

snippets of e-mail that gates both sent and received66 gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions as to his demeanor during the deposition he said did i fence with boies  i plead guilty whatever that penalty is should be levied against me rudeness to boies in the first degree67 despite gates denials the judge ruled that microsoft had
