shepherds flat wind farm is an 845 megawatt mw wind farm in the us state of oregon the 550 mw desert sunlight solar farm in california the 392 mw ivanpah solar power facility in california the facilitys three towers construction of the salt tanks which provide efficient thermal energy storage1 so that output can be provided after the sun goes down and output can be scheduled to meet demand requirements2 the 280 mw solana generating station is designed to provide six hours of energy storage this allows the plant to generate about 38 percent of its rated capacity over the course of a year3 global public support for different energy sources 2011 based on a poll by ipsos global dvisor4 the incentive to use 100 renewable energy for electricity heating and cooling and transport is motivated by global warming pollution and other ecological as well as economic and energy security concerns shifting the total global primary energy supply to renewable sources requires a transition of the energy system in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated5 in 2014 renewables such as wind geothermal solar biomass and burnt waste provided 19 of the total world final energy consumption roughly half of it traditional use of biomass6 the most important sector electricity with a renewable share of 22.8 most of it coming from water power with a share of 16.6 followed by wind with 3.1.6 several places run their grids almost exclusively on renewable energy at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of climate stabilization wedges that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges7 mark z jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program says producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and that existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic jacobson says that energy costs today with a wind solar water system should be similar to todays energy costs from other optimally cost-effective strategies8 the main obstacle against this scenario is the lack of political will9 similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand10 the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political rather than technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints11 contents 1 history 2 recent developments 3 places with around 100 renewable electricity 4 obstacles 5 see also 6 references 7 external links 8 further reading historyedit using 100 renewable energy was first suggested in a science paper12 published in 1975 by danish physicist bent srensen which was followed by several other proposals13 in 1976 energy policy analyst amory lovins coined the term soft energy path to describe an alternative future where energy efficiency and appropriate renewable energy sources steadily replace a centralized energy system based on fossil and nuclear fuels14 in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published these were followed by the first detailed 100 scenarios in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100 renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa in the same year danish energy professor henrik lund published a first paper15 in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100 renewable energy in denmark since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100 renewable energy after 2009 publications began to rise steeply covering 100 scenarios for countries in europa america australia and other parts of the world13 even in the early 2000s it was extraordinary for scientists and decision-makers to consider the concept of 100 per cent renewable electricity however renewable energy progress has been so rapid that things have totally changed since then16 solar photovoltaic modules have dropped about 75 per cent in price current scientific and technological advances in the laboratory suggest that they will soon be so cheap that the principal cost of going solar on residential and commercial buildings will be installation on-shore wind power is spreading over all continents and is economically competitive with fossil and nuclear power in several regions concentrated solar thermal power cst with thermal storage has moved from the demonstration stage of maturity to the limited commercial stage and still has the potential for further cost reductions of about 50 per cent16 renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates had anticipated5 wind turbines generate 3917 percent of danish electricity and denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well together wind and biomass provide 44 of the electricity consumed by the countrys six million inhabitants in 2010 portugals 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources spains 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables5 renewable energy has a history of strong public support in america for example a 2013 gallup survey showed that two in three americans want the us to increase domestic energy production using solar power 76 wind power 71 and natural gas 65 far fewer want more petroleum production 46 and more nuclear power 37 least favored is coal with about one in three americans favouring it18 ren21 says renewable energy already plays a significant role and there are many policy targets which aim to increase this at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy including a binding 20 by 2020 target for the european union some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100 renewables outside europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 20202030 time frame that range from 10 to 50.19 nuclear power involves substantial accident risks eg fukushima nuclear disaster chernobyl disaster and the unsolved problem of safe long-term high-level radioactive waste management and carbon capture and storage has rather limited safe storage potentials13 these constraints have also led to an interest in 100 renewable energy a well established body of academic literature has been written over the past decade evaluating scenarios for 100 renewable energy for various geographical areas in recent years more detailed analyses have emerged from government and industry sources20 the incentive to use 100 renewable energy is created by global warming and ecological as well as economic concerns post peak oil the first country to propose 100 renewable energy was iceland in 1998.21 proposals have been made for japan in 2003,22 and for australia in 2011.23 albania iceland and paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources albania and paraguay 100 from hydroelectricity iceland 72 hydro and 28 geothermal24 norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources 97 percent from hydropower25 iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity the road map for the united states2627 commitment by denmark28 and vision 2050 for europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100 renewable energy29 later reduced to 2040 in 2011.30 zero carbon britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in britain by 2030 by transitioning to renewable energy31 in 2015 hawaii enacted a law that the renewable portfolio standard shall be 100 percent by 2045 this is often confused with renewable energy if electricity produced on the grid is 65 gwh from fossil fuel and 35 gwh from renewable energy and rooftop solar produces 80 gwh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 gwh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 gwh then the rps is 115 percent32 it is estimated that the world will spend an extra 8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100 renewable energy33 research that has been published in energy policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100 renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable but requires political support it would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldnt utilize bioenergy other changes involve use of electric cars and the development of enhanced transmission grids and storage3435 recent developmentsedit the fourth revolution energy is a german documentary film released in 2010 it shows the vision of a global society which lives in a world where the energy is produced 100 with renewable energies showing a complete reconstruction of the economy to reach this goal in 2011 hermann scheer wrote the book the energy imperative 100 percent renewable now published by routledge reinventing fire is a book by amory lovins released in october 2011 by combining reduced energy use with energy efficiency gains lovins says that there will be a 5 trillion saving and a faster-growing economy this can all be done with the profitable commercialization of existing energy-saving technologies through market forces led by business36 bill clinton says the book is a wise detailed and comprehensive blueprint37 the first paragraph of the preface says imagine fuel without fear no climate change no oil spills dead coal miners dirty air devastated lands lost wildlife no energy poverty no oil-fed wars tyrannies or terrorists nothing to run out nothing to cut off nothing to worry about just energy abundance benign and affordable for all for ever38 the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand in a 2011 review of 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17 of total energy by 2030 and 27 by 2050 the highest forecast projected 43 supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77 by 2050.39 in 2011 the international energy agency has said that solar energy technologies in its many forms can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces40 the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared40 in 2011 the refereed journal energy policy published two articles by mark z jacobson a professor of engineering at stanford university and research scientist mark a delucchi about changing our energy supply mix and providing all global energy with wind water and solar power the articles analyze the feasibility of providing worldwide energy for electric power transportation and heatingcooling from wind water and sunlight wws which are safe clean options in part i jacobson and delucchi discuss wws energy system characteristics aspects of energy demand wws resource availability wws devices needed and material requirements41 they estimate that 3,800,000 5 mw wind turbines 5350 100 mw geothermal power plants and 270 new 1300 mw hydroelectric power plants will be required in terms of solar power an additional 49,000 300 mw concentrating solar plants 40,000 300 mw solar photovoltaic power plants and 1.7 billion 3kw rooftop photovoltaic systems will also be needed such an extensive wws infrastructure could decrease world power demand by 30.41 in part ii jacobson and delucchi address variability of supply system economics and energy policy initiatives associated with a wws system the authors advocate producing all new energy with wws by 2030 and replacing existing energy supply arrangements by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic energy costs with a wws system should be similar to todays energy costs8 in general jacobson has said wind water and solar technologies can provide 100 per cent of the worlds energy eliminating all fossil fuels42 he advocates a smart mix of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps43 a 2012 study by the university of delaware for a 72 gw system considered 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective for the pjm interconnection would use 17 gw of solar 68 gw of offshore wind and 115 gw of onshore wind although at times as much as three times the demand would be provided 0.1 of the time would require generation from other sources44 in march 2012 denmarks parliament agreed on a comprehensive new set promotional programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy that will lead to the country getting 100 percent of electricity heat and fuels from renewables by 2050.45 irenec is an annual conference on 100 renewable energy started in 2011 by eurosolar turkey the 2013 conference was in istanbul4647 more recently jacobson and his colleagues have developed detailed proposals for switching to 100 renewable energy produced by wind water and sunlight for new york48 california49 and washington50 states by 2050 as of 2014 a more expansive new plan for the 50 states has been drawn up which includes an online interactive map showing the renewable resource potential of each of the 50 states the 50-state plan is part of the solutions project an independent outreach effort led by jacobson actor mark ruffalo and film director josh fox51 as of 2014 many detailed assessments show that the energy service needs of a world enjoying radically higher levels of wellbeing can be economically met entirely through the diverse currently available technological and organisational innovations around wind solar biomass biofuel hydro ocean and geothermal energy debate over detailed plans remain but transformations in global energy services based entirely around renewable energy are in principle technically practicable economically feasible socially viable and so realisable this prospect underpins the ambitious commitment by germany one of the worlds most successful industrial economies to undertake a major energy transition energiewende52 in 2015 a study was published in energy and environmental science that describes a pathway to 100 renewable energy in the united states by 2050 without using biomass implementation of this roadmap is regarded as both environmentally and economically feasible and reasonable as by 2050 it would save about 600 billion dollars health costs a year due to reduced air pollution and 3.3 trillion global warming costs this would translate in yearly cost savings per head of around 8300 compared to a business as usual pathway according to that study barriers that could hamper implementation are neither technical nor economic but social and political as most people didnt know that benefits from such a transformation far exceeded the costs53 places with around 100 renewable

electricity sector in denmark as of 2014 is 40 wind power with plans in place to reach 85 the electricity sector in canada and the electricity sector in new zealand have even higher percentages 65 and 75 respectively and austria is approaching 70.75 as of 2015 the electricity sector in germany sometimes meets almost 100 of the electricity demand with pv and wind power and renewable electricity is over 25.7677 albania has 94.8 of installed capacity as hydroelectric 5.2 diesel generator but albania imports 39 of its electricity7879 in 2016 portugal achieved 100 renewable electricity for four days between 7 may and 11 may partly because efficient energy use had reduced electricity demand80 france and sweden have low carbon intensity since they predominately use a mixture of nuclear power and hydroelectricity although electricity is currently a big fraction of primary energy it is to be expected that with renewable energy deployment primary energy use will go down sharply as electricity use increases as it is likely to be combined with some degree of further electrification8182 for example electric cars achieve much better miles per gallon equivalent than fossil fuel cars and another example is renewable heat such as in the case of denmark which is proposing to move to greater use of heat pumps for heating buildings which provide multiple kilowatts of heat per kilowatt of electricity obstaclesedit the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies at the pace required to prevent runaway climate change are primarily political and not technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are11 climate change denial efforts to impede renewable energy by the fossil fuel industry political paralysis unsustainable consumption of energy and resources path dependencies and outdated infrastructure financial and governance constraints nasa climate scientist james hansen discusses the problem with rapid phase out of fossil fuels and said that while it is conceivable in places such as new zealand and norway suggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the united states china india or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the easter bunny and tooth fairy8384 in 2013 smil analyzed proposals to depend on wind and solar-generated electricity including the proposals of jacobson and colleagues and writing in an issue of spectrum prepared by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers he identified numerous points of concern such as cost intermittent power supply growing nimbyism and a lack of infrastructure as negative factors and said that history and a consideration of the technical requirements show that the problem is much greater than these advocates have supposed8385 smil and hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power but many other scientists and engineers have analysed this situation and said that the electricity grid can cope86citation needed lester r brown founder and president of the earth policy institute a nonprofit research organization based in washington dc says a rapid transition to 100 renewable energy is both possible and necessary brown compares with the us entry into world war ii and the subsequent rapid mobilization and transformation of the us industry and economy a quick transition to 100 renewable energy and saving of our civilization is proposed by brown to follow an approach with similar urgency87 the international energy agency says that there has been too much attention on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production88 the issue of intermittent supply applies to popular renewable technologies mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system as well as the demand side flexibility variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when dispatchable generation is also available but at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification88 renewable electricity supply in the 20-50 penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system89 in 2011 the intergovernmental panel on climate change the worlds leading climate researchers selected by the united nations said as infrastructure and energy systems develop in spite of the complexities there are few if any fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied39 ipcc scenarios generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world90 the ipcc said that if governments were supportive and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed renewable energy supply could account for almost 80 of the worlds energy use within forty years91 rajendra pachauri chairman of the ipcc said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1 of global gdp annually this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible91 in november 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change came out with their fifth report saying that in the absence of any one technology such as bioenergy carbon dioxide capture and storage nuclear wind and solar climate change mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on which technology is absent for example it may cost 40 more to reduce carbon emissions without carbon dioxide capture table 3.292 see alsoedit renewable energy portal catching the sun film energy transition energy transition in germany germany
