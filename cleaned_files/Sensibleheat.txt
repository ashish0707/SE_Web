sensible heat is heat exchanged by a body or thermodynamic system in which the exchange of heat changes the temperature of the body or system and some macroscopic variables of the body or system but leaves unchanged certain other macroscopic variables of the body or system such as volume or pressure1234 usageedit thermodynamics the classical carnot heat engine branches classical statistical chemical equilibrium non-equilibrium laws zeroth first second third systems state equation of state ideal gas real gas state of matter equilibrium control volume instruments processes isobaric isochoric isothermal adiabatic isentropic isenthalpic quasistatic polytropic free expansion reversibility irreversibility endoreversibility cycles heat engines heat pumps thermal efficiency system properties note conjugate variables in italics property diagrams intensive and extensive properties functions of state temperature entropyintroduction pressure volume chemical potential particle number vapor quality reduced properties process functions work heat material properties property databases specific heat capacity c displaystyle c t displaystyle t s displaystyle partial s n displaystyle n t displaystyle partial t compressibility displaystyle beta -
