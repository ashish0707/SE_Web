shikoku and kyushu the ryukyu islands which include okinawa are a chain to the south of kyushu together they are often known as the japanese archipelago59 about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use260 as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world61 the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward

higher education institution267 the two top-ranking universities in japan are the university of tokyo and kyoto university268269 the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the

permanent capital in nara its checkerboard street layout used the chinese capital of changan as a template for its design a gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of
