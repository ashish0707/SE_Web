environmental and social impact it may have throughout its total life span including its carbon footprint according to the may 2007 vogue sustainable fashion does not appear to be a short-term trend but one that could last multiple seasons the very word season being up for grabs in a climate-affected world1 while environmentalism used to manifest itself in the fashion world through a donation of percentage of sales of a product to a charitable cause fashion designers are now re-introducing eco-conscious methods at the source through the use of environmentally friendly materials and socially responsible methods of production according to earth pledge a non-profit organization committed to promoting and supporting sustainable development at least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into textiles and 25 of the worlds pesticides are used to grow non-organic cotton this causes irreversible damage to people and the environment and still two thirds of a garments carbon footprint will occur after it is purchased2 with the average american throwing away nearly 70 pounds of clothing per year3 the fashion industry is the second largest cause of pollution worldwide4 slow

plentifully without pesticides39 even with this bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo40 some believe that stalk fibres and particularly hemp is one of the best choice for eco fabrics due to its ease of growth though it remains illegal to grow in some countriescitation needed these facts regarding production of
