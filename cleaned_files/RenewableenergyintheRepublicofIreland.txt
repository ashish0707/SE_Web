under the renewable energy directive ireland has set a target of producing 16 of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020 between 2005 and 2014 the percentage of energy from renewable energy sources grew from just 3.1 to 8.6 of total final consumption by 2020 ireland has a target of producing 42.5 of its electricity needs from renewable electricity the country has a large and growing installed windpower capacity at 2,486 mw by the end of 2015 producing just under a quarter of all its electricity needs in that year in contrast in 2015 it had the second lowest
