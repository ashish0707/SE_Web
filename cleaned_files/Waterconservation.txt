united states postal stamp advocating water conservation water conservation includes all the policies strategies and activities made to manage fresh water as a sustainable resource to protect the water environment and to meet current and future human demand population household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used factors such as climate change have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation1 the goals of water conservation efforts include ensuring availability of water for future generations where the withdrawal of fresh water from an ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate energy conservation as water pumping delivery and waste water treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy in some regions of the world over 15 of total electricity consumption is devoted to water management habitat conservation where minimizing human water use helps to preserve freshwater habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl but also water quality2 contents 1 strategies 2 social solutions 3 household applications 4 commercial applications 5 agricultural applications 6 see also 7 references 8 external links strategiesedit the key activities that benefit water conservation are as follows any beneficial deduction in water loss use and waste of resources avoiding any damage to water quality improving water management practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water34 social solutionsedit drip irrigation system in new mexico water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level by either municipal water utilities or regional governments common strategies include public outreach campaigns567 tiered water rates charging progressively higher prices as water use increases or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing8 cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of xeriscaping or natural landscaping in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage9 one fundamental conservation goal is universal metering the prevalence of residential water metering varies significantly worldwide recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30 of uk households10 and about 61 of urban canadian homes as of 2001.11 although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings the us environmental protection agency estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent12 in addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use metering is also an important way to identify and localize water leakage water metering would benefit society in the long run it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come one would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by public domestic and manufacturing services some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70 of the worlds fresh water use13 the agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically and water subsidies are common conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force farmers to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques new technology poses a few new options for consumers features such and full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste also available in our modern world is shower heads that help reduce wasting water old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute all new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage household applicationsedit the home water works website contains useful information on household water conservation14 contrary to popular view experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers15 water-saving technology for the home includes low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy low-flush toilets and composting toilets these have a dramatic impact in the developed world as conventional western toilets use large volumes of water dual flush toilets created by caroma includes two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water dual flush toilets use up to 67 less water than conventional toilets faucet aerators which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain wetting effectiveness while using less water an additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes raw water flushing where toilets use sea water or non-purified water waste water reuse or recycling systems allowing reuse of graywater for flushing toilets or watering gardens recycling of wastewater through purification at a water treatment plant see also wastewater - reuse rainwater harvesting high-efficiency clothes washers weather-based irrigation controllers garden hose nozzles that shut off water when it is not being used instead of letting a hose run low flow taps in wash basins swimming pool covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water energy and chemical costs automatic faucet is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet it automates the use of faucets without the use of hands commercial applicationsedit many water-saving devices such as low-flush toilets that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving other water-saving technology for businesses includes waterless urinals waterless car washes infrared or foot-operated taps which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom pressurized waterbrooms which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks x-ray film processor re-circulation systems cooling tower conductivity controllers water-saving steam sterilizers for use in hospitals and health care facilities rain water harvesting water to water heat exchangers agricultural applicationsedit overhead irrigation center pivot design for crop irrigation optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation runoff or subsurface drainage while maximizing production an evaporation pan in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements flood irrigation the oldest and most common type is often very uneven in distribution as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts overhead irrigation using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses however drip irrigation is increasingly affordable especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates there are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation as changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system this may include chiseling compacted soils creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules12 usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system the 2011 unep green economy report notes that improved soil organic matter from the use of green manures mulching and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains16 which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season see alsoedit water portal
