a building envelope is the physical separator between the conditioned and unconditioned environment of a building including the resistance to air water heat1 light and noise2 transfer contents 1 discussion 2 water and water vapor control 3 air control 4 thermal envelope 5 see also 6 references 7 external links discussionedit the building envelope is all of the elements of the outer shell that maintain a dry heated or cooled indoor environment and facilitate its climate control building envelope design is a specialized area of architectural and engineering practice that draws from all areas of building science and indoor climate control2 the many functions of the building envelope can be separated into three categories3 support to resist and transfer structural loads control the flow of matter and energy of all types finish to meet human desires on the inside and outside the control function is at the core of good performance and in practice focuses in order of importance on rain control air control heat control and vapor control3 water and water vapor controledit control of rain is most fundamental and there are numerous strategies to this end namely perfect barriers drained screens and mass storage systems4 one of the main purposes of a roof is to resist water two broad categories of roofs are flat and pitched flat roofs actually slope up to 10 or 15 but are built to resist standing water pitched roofs are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or ice damming typically residential pitched roofs are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense domestic roof construction may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation walls do not get as severe water exposure as roofs but still leak water types of wall systems with regard to water penetration are barrier drainage and surface-sealed walls5 barrier walls are designed to allow water to be absorbed but not penetrate the wall and include concrete and some masonry walls drainage walls allow water that leaks into the wall to drain out such as cavity walls drainage walls may also be ventilated to aid drying such as rainscreen and pressure equalization wall systems sealed-surface walls do not allow any water penetration at the exterior surface of the siding material generally most materials will not remain sealed over the long term and this system is very limited but ordinary residential construction often treats walls as sealed-surface systems relying on the siding and an underlayment layer sometimes called housewrap moisture can enter basements through the walls or floor basement waterproofing and drainage keep the walls dry and a moisture barrier is needed under the floor air controledit main article air barrier control of air flow is important to ensure indoor air quality control energy consumption avoid condensation and thus help ensure durability and to provide comfort control of air movement includes flow through the enclosure the assembly of materials that perform this function is termed the air barrier system or through components of the building envelope interstitial itself as well as into and out of the interior space which can affect building insulation performance greatly hence air control includes the control of windwashing6 cold air passing through insulation and convective loops which are air movements within a wall or ceiling that may result in 10 to 20 of the heat loss alone7 the physical components of the envelope include the foundation roof walls doors windows ceiling and their related barriers and insulation the dimensions performance and compatibility of materials fabrication process and details connections and interactions are the main factors that determine the effectiveness and durability of the building enclosure system common measures of the effectiveness of a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate comfort indoor air quality hygiene and public health durability and energy efficiency in order to achieve these objectives all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure a drainage plane an air barrier a thermal barrier and may include a vapor barrier moisture control eg damp proofing is essential in all climates but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding8 thermal envelopeedit the thermal envelope or heat flow control layer is part of a building envelope but may be in a different location such as in a ceiling the difference can be illustrated by understanding that an insulated attic floor is the primary thermal control layer between the inside of the house and the exterior while the entire roof from the surface of the shingles to the interior paint finish on the ceiling comprises the building envelope9 building envelope thermography involves using an infrared camera to view temperature anomalies on the interior and exterior surfaces of the structure analysis of infrared images can be useful in identifying moisture issues from water intrusion or interstitial condensation10 see alsoedit
