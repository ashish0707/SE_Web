a 1956 world oil production distribution showing historical data and future production proposed by m king hubbert it has a peak of 12.5 billion barrels per year in about the year 2000 energy descent is the post-peak oil transitional phase when humankind is predicted to move from the ascending use of energy that has occurred since the industrial revolution to a descending use of energy contents 1 summary 2 criticism 3 see also 4 external links 5 references summaryedit energy descent refers to retraction of oil use after the peak oil availability planning and preparing for this peak oil energy descent period has been recently promoted by david holmgren rob hopkins of the transition towns movement and richard heinberg in the 2004 book power down that oil reserves are dwindling is now becoming acknowledged more widely especially after the international energy agency released the 2008 world energy outlook report1 between 2007 and 2008 the iea changed its figures for projected rate of decline in world energy supply from 3.7 a year 2007 to a projected rate of decline of 6.7 a year 2008.2 in 2008 several major companies including arup yahoo and virgin created the uk industry taskforce on peak oil and energy security itpoes and released a report the oil crunch3 which calls for collaborative contingency planning by government and industry in the face of dwindling oil reserves3 an energy descent action plan edap is a local plan for planning and preparing for energy descent it goes well beyond issues of energy supply to look at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of health education economy and much more energy descent planning is a process developed by the transition towns movement criticismedit some techno-optimists such as julian simon have disputed energy projections such as this arguing that as oil becomes more expensive humanity will tend to diversify its energy sources away from a reliance on oil thus avoiding undesired global
