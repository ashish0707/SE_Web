births deaths immigration and emigration 2013 human overpopulation occurs if the number of people in a group exceeds the carrying capacity of the region occupied by that group overpopulation can further be viewed in a long term perspective as existing when a population cannot be maintained given the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources or given the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population1 the term human overpopulation often refers to the relationship between the entire human population and its environment the earth2 or to smaller geographical areas such as countries overpopulation can result from an increase in births a decline in mortality rates an increase in immigration or an unsustainable biome and depletion of resources it is possible for very sparsely populated areas to be overpopulated if the area has a meagre or non-existent capability to sustain life eg a desert advocates of population moderation cite issues like quality of life carrying capacity and risk of starvation as a basis to argue against continuing high human population growth and for population decline in either case a consideration is that any

year 1350,3 although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years mainly due to medical advancements and increase in agricultural productivity the rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s the united nations has expressed concern on continued excessive population growth in sub-saharan africa4 recent research has demonstrated that those concerns are well grounded5 as of november 4 2016 the worlds human population is estimated to be 7.461billion by the united states census bureau6 and over 7 billion by the united nations789 most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the earth under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion depending on which estimate is used human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred nevertheless the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern the population is expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the years 20401011 and 2050.12 in may 2011 the united nations increased the medium variant projections to 9.3 billion for 2050 and 10.1 billion for 2100.13 the recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants the interacademy panel statement on population growth circa 1994 stated that many environmental problems such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide global warming and pollution are aggravated by the population expansion14 other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food starvation and malnutrition consumption of natural resources such as fossil fuels faster than the rate of regeneration and a deterioration in living conditions wealthy but highly populated territories like britain rely on food imports from overseas15 this was severely felt during the world wars when despite food efficiency initiatives like dig for victory and food rationing britain needed to fight to secure import routes however many believe that waste and over-consumption especially by wealthy nations is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation16 most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception only china has imposed legal restrictions on having more than one child extraterrestrial settlement and other technical solutions have been proposed as ways to mitigate overpopulation in the future history of concernedit thousands of scooters make their way through ho chi minh city vietnam concern about overpopulation is an ancient topic tertullian was a resident of the city of carthage in the second century ce when the population of the world was about 190 million only 3-4 of what it is today he notably said what most frequently meets our view and occasions complaint is our teeming population our numbers are burdensome to the world which can hardly support us in very deed pestilence and famine and wars and earthquakes have to be regarded as a remedy for nations as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the human race before that plato aristotle and others broached the topic as well17 throughout history population growth has usually been slow despite high birth rates due to war plagues and other diseases and high infant mortality during the 750 years before the industrial revolution the worlds population increased very slowly remaining under 250 million18 by the beginning of the 19th century the world population had grown to a billion individuals and intellectuals such as thomas malthus predicted that mankind would outgrow its available resources because a finite amount of land would be incapable of supporting a population with a limitless potential for increase19 mercantillists argued that a large population was a form of wealth which made it possible to create bigger markets and armies during the 19th century malthuss work was often interpreted in a way that blamed the poor alone for their condition and helping them was said to worsen conditions in the long run20 this resulted for example in the english poor laws of 183420 and in a hesitating response to the irish great famine of 184552.21 the un population assessment report of 2004 projects that the world population will plateau by 2050 and will remain stable until 2300 22 more recent un projections suggest the population could grow to as many as 15 billion by

7.7 estimate24 the human population has gone through a number of periods of growth since the dawn of civilization in the holocene period around 10,000 bce the beginning of civilization roughly coincides with the receding of glacial ice following the end of the last glacial period25 it is estimated that between 1-5 million people subsisting on hunting and foraging inhabited the earth in the period before the neolithic revolution when human activity shifted away from hunter-gathering and towards very primitive farming26 around 8000 bce at the dawn of agriculture the population of the world was approximately 5 million27 the next several millennia saw a steady increase in the population with very rapid growth beginning in 1000 bce and a peak of between 200 and 300 million people in 1 bce the plague of justinian caused europes population to drop by around 50 between 541 and the 8th century28 steady growth resumed in 800 ce29 however growth was again disrupted by frequent plagues most notably the black death during the 14th century the effects of the black death are thought to have reduced the worlds population then at an estimated 450 million to between 350 and 375 million by 1400.30 the population of europe stood at over 70 million in 134031 these levels did not return until 200 years later32 englands population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650 up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500.33 new crops from the americas via the spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the population growth34 in other parts of the globe chinas population at the founding of the ming dynasty in 1368 stood close to 60 million approaching 150 million by the end of the dynasty in 1644.3536 the population of the americas in 1500 may have been between 50 and 100 million37 encounters between european explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence archaeological evidence indicates that the death of around 90 of the native american population of the new world was caused by old world diseases such as smallpox measles and influenza38 europeans introduced diseases alien to the indigenous people therefore they did not have immunity to these foreign diseases39 after the start of the industrial revolution during the 18th century the rate of population growth began to increase by the end of the century the worlds population was estimated at just under 1 billion40 at the turn of the 20th century the worlds population was roughly 1.6 billion40 by 1940 this figure had increased to 2.3 billion41

6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009.51 niger uganda nigeria tanzania ethiopia and the drc are witnessing a similar growth in population the situation is most acute in western central and eastern africa5 refugees from places like sudan have further strained the resources of neighboring states like chad and egypt chad is also host to roughly 255,000 refugees from sudans darfur region and about 77,000 refugees from the central african republic while approximately 188,000 chadians have been displaced by their own civil war and famines have either fled to either the sudan the niger or more

and some predictions putting the population as high as 11 billion in 2050.56 by 2100 the population could reach 15 billion23 walter greiling projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion in the 21st century and then stop growing after a readjustment of the third world and a sanitation of the tropics57 according to the united nations world population prospects report58 the world population is currently growing by approximately 74 million people per year current united nations predictions estimate that the world population will reach 9.0 billion around 2050 assuming a decrease in average fertility rate from 2.5 down to 2.0.5960 almost all growth will take place in the less developed regions where todays 5.3 billion population of underdeveloped countries is expected to increase to 7.8 billion in 2050 by contrast the population of the more developed regions will remain mostly unchanged at 1.2 billion an exception is the united states population which is expected to increase by 44 from 2008 to 2050.61 in 20002005 the average world fertility was 2.65 children per woman about half the level in 19501955 5 children per woman in

regions the projection is to 82 years by 2050 among the least developed countries where life expectancy today is just under 50 years it is expected to increase to 66 years by 20452050 the population of 51 countries or areas is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005 during 20052050 the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 20052050 population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration in 20002005 net migration in 28 countries either prevented population decline or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase births minus deaths to population growth birth rates are now falling in a small percentage of developing countries while the actual populations in many developed countries would fall without immigration59 urban growthedit urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 3 of the worlds population lived in cities in 1800 rising to 47 at the end of the twentieth century in 1800 only 3 of the worlds population lived in cities by the 20th centurys close 47 did so in 1950 there were 83 cities with populations exceeding one million but by 2007 this had risen to 468 agglomerations of more than one million62 if the trend continues the worlds urban population will double every 38 years according to researchers the un forecasts that todays urban population of 3.2 billion will rise to nearly 5 billion by 2030 when three out of five people will live in cities63 the increase will be most dramatic in the poorest and least-urbanised continents asia and africa projections indicate that most urban growth over the next 25 years will be in developing countries64 one billion people one-seventh of the worlds population or one-third of urban population now live in shanty towns65 which are seen as breeding grounds for social problems such as crime drug addictioncitation needed alcoholism poverty and unemployment in many poor countries slums exhibit high rates of disease due to unsanitary conditions malnutrition and lack of basic health care66 in 2000 there were 18 megacities conurbations such as tokyo beijing guangzhou seoul karachi mexico city mumbai so paulo and new york city that have populations in excess of 10 million inhabitants greater tokyo already has 35 million more than the entire population of canada at 34.1 million67 according to the far eastern economic review asia alone will have at least 10 hypercities by 2025 that is cities inhabited by more than 19 million people including jakarta 24.9 million people dhaka 25 million karachi 26.5 million shanghai 27 million and mumbai 33 million68 lagos has grown from 300,000 in 1950 to an estimated 15 million today and the nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to 25 million residents by 2015.69 chinese experts forecast that chinese cities will contain 800 million people by 2020.70 causesedit street in kathmandu from a historical perspective technological revolutions have coincided with population explosions there have been three major technological revolutions the tool-making revolution the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution all of which allowed humans more access to food resulting in subsequent population explosions7172 for example the use of tools such as bow and arrow allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods eg animal meat similarly the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply which was used to support more people food production further increased with the industrial revolution as machinery fertilizers herbicides and pesticides were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields73 in short similar to bacteria that multiply in response to increased food supply humans have increased their population as soon as food became more abundant as a result of technological innovations significant increases in human population occur whenever the birth rate exceeds the death rate for extended periods of time traditionally the fertility rate is strongly influenced by cultural and social norms that are rather stable and therefore slow to adapt to changes in the social technological or environmental conditions for example when death rates fell during the 19th and 20th century as a result of improved sanitation child immunizations and other advances in medicine allowing more newborns to survive the fertility rate did not adjust downward fast enough resulting in significant population growth prior to these changes seven out of ten children died before reaching reproductive age while today about 95 of newborns in industrialized nations reach adulthood74 agricultureedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it february 2014 agriculture has been the main factor behind human population growth this dates back to prehistoric times when agricultural methods were first developed and continues to the present day with fertilizers agrochemicals large-scale mechanization genetic manipulation and other technologies75 psychological factorsedit human psychology and the cycle of entrenched poverty as well as the rest of the worlds reaction to it are also causative factors areas with greater burden of disease and

million to date yet during the last two decades money and initiatives to lower population growth by contraception have been sidelined in favor of combating hiv76 feeding the population explosion that we see in africa today in 1990 this continents population was roughly 600 million today it is over 1,050 million 150 million more than if the hivaids crisis had never occurred77 extremesedit population growth rates between 1950 and 2012 range from a 0.5 increase in the case of bulgaria to a more than 100 fold increase for the united arab emirates from 79,050 to 8.5 million78 roughly half of all nations have quadrupled their populations since 1950.78 demographic transitionedit main articles demographic transition and sub-replacement fertility the theory of demographic transition held that after the standard of living and life expectancy increase family sizes and birth rates decline however as new data has become available it has been observed that after a certain level of development hdi equal to 0.86 or higher the fertility increases again79 this means that both the worry that the theory generated about aging populations and the complacency it bred regarding the future environmental impact of population growth are misguided factors cited in the old theory included such social factors as later ages of marriage the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside child rearing and domestic work and the decreased need of children in industrialized settings the latter factor stems from the fact that children perform a great deal of work in small-scale agricultural societies and work less in industrial ones it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions many countries have high population growth rates but lower total fertility rates because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturityoriginal researchcitation needed demographic entrapment is a concept developed by maurice king honorary research fellow at the university of leeds who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its carrying capacity no possibility of migration and exports too little to be able to import food this will cause starvation he claims that for example many sub-saharan nations are or will become stuck in demographic entrapment instead of having a demographic transition80 for the world as a whole the number of children born per woman decreased from 5.02 to 2.65 between 1950 and 2005 a breakdown by region is as follows europe 2.66 to 1.41 north america 3.47 to 1.99 oceania 3.87 to 2.30 central america 6.38 to 2.66 south america 5.75 to 2.49 asia excluding middle east 5.85 to 2.43 middle east north africa 6.99 to 3.37 sub-saharan africa 6.7 to 5.53 excluding the observed reversal in fertility decrease for high development the projected world number of children born per woman for 2050 would be around 2.05 only the middle east north africa 2.09 and sub-saharan africa 2.61 would then have numbers greater than 2.05.81 carrying capacityedit main article carrying capacity a family planning placard in ethiopia it shows some negative effects of having too many children some groups for example the world wide fund for nature8283 and global footprint network have stated that the carrying capacity for the human population has been exceeded as measured using the ecological footprint in 2006 wwfs living planet report stated that in order for all humans to live with the current consumption patterns of europeans we would be spending three times more than what the planet can renew84 humanity as a whole was using by 2006 40 percent more than what earth can regenerate85 however roger martin of population matters states the view the poor want to get rich and i want them to get rich with a later addition of course we have to change consumption habits but weve also got to stabilise our numbers86 but critics question the simplifications and statistical methods used in calculating ecological footprints therefore global footprint network and its partner organizations have engaged with national governments and international agencies to test the results reviews have been produced by france germany the european commission switzerland luxembourg japan and the united arab emirates87 some point out that a more refined method of assessing ecological footprint is to designate sustainable versus non-sustainable categories of consumption8889 however if yield estimates were adjusted for sustainable levels of production the yield figures would be lower and hence the overshoot estimated by the ecological footprint method even higher other studies give particular attention to resource depletion and increased world affluencefurther explanation needed 9091 in a 1994 study titled food land population and the us economy david pimentel and mario giampietro estimated the maximum us population for a sustainable economy at 200 million92 and in order to achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster the united states would have to reduce its population by at least one-third and world population would have to be reduced by two-thirds93 many quantitative studies have estimated the worlds carrying capacity for humans that is a limit to the world population94 a meta-analysis of 69 such studies suggests a point estimate of the limit to be 7.7 billion people while lower and upper meta-bounds for current technology are estimated as 0.65 and 98 billion people respectively they conclude recent predictions of stabilized world population levels for 2050 exceed several of our meta-estimates of a world population limit95 effects of human overpopulationedit main article human impact on the environment humanitys overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides raw population the lifestyle including overall affluence and resource utilization and the pollution including carbon footprint are equally important in 2008 the new york times stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world who make up the majority of the human population96 some problems associated with or exacerbated by human overpopulation and over-consumption are inadequate fresh water97 for drinking as well as sewage treatment and effluent discharge some countries like saudi arabia use energy-expensive desalination to solve the problem of water shortages9899 depletion of natural resources especially fossil fuels100 world energy consumption predictions 19702025 increased levels of air pollution water pollution soil contamination and noise pollution once a country has industrialized and become wealthy a combination of government regulation and technological innovation causes pollution to decline substantially even as the population continues to grow101 deforestation and loss of ecosystems102 that valuably contribute to the global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance about eight million hectares of forest are lost each year103 changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global warming104105 loss of arable land and increase in desertification106 deforestation and desertification can be reversed by adopting property rights and this policy is successful even while the human population continues to grow107 mass species extinctions108109 from reduced habitat in tropical forests due to slash-and-burn techniques that sometimes are practiced by shifting cultivators especially in countries with rapidly expanding rural populations present extinction rates may be as high as 140,000 species lost per year110 as of february 2011 the iucn red list lists a total of 801 animal species having gone extinct during recorded human history111 high infant and child mortality112 high rates of infant mortality are associated with poverty rich countries with high population densities have low rates of infant mortality113 intensive factory farming to support large populations it results in human threats including the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria diseases excessive air and water pollution and new viruses that infect humanscitation needed 1972 increased chance of the emergence of new epidemics and pandemics114 for many environmental and social reasons including overcrowded living conditions malnutrition and inadequate inaccessible or non-existent health care the poor are more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases115 starvation malnutrition116 or poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases eg rickets however rich countries with high population densities do not have famine117 poverty coupled with inflation in some regions and a resulting low level of capital formation poverty and inflation are aggravated by bad government and bad economic policies many countries with high population densities have eliminated absolute poverty and keep their inflation rates very low118 low life expectancy in countries with fastest growing populations119 unhygienic living conditions for many based upon water resource depletion discharge of raw sewage120 and solid waste disposal however this problem can be reduced with the adoption of sewers for example after karachi pakistan installed sewers its infant mortality rate fell substantially121 elevated crime rate due to drug cartels and increased theft by people stealing resources to survive122 conflict over scarce resources and crowding leading to increased levels of warfare123 less personal freedom and more restrictive laws laws regulate interactions between humans law serves as a primary social mediator of relations between peoplecitation needed the higher the population density the more frequent such interactions become and thus there develops a need for more laws andor more restrictive laws to regulate these interactions it was even speculated by aldous huxley in 1958 that democracy is threatened due to overpopulation and could give rise to totalitarian style governments124 david attenborough described the level of human population on the planet as a multiplier of all other environmental problems125 many of these problems are explored in the dystopic science fiction film soylent green where an overpopulated earth suffers from food shortages depleted resources and poverty and in the documentary aftermath population overload some economists such as thomas sowell126 and walter e williams117 argue that third world poverty and famine are caused in part by bad government and bad economic policies most biologists and sociologists see overpopulation as a serious threat to the quality of human life102127 some deep ecologists such as the radical thinker and polemicist pentti linkola see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire biosphere128 resourcesedit overpopulation does not depend only on the size or density of the population but on the ratio of population to available sustainable resources it also depends on how resources are managed and distributed throughout the population the resources to be considered when evaluating whether an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water clean air food shelter warmth and other resources necessary to sustain life if the quality of human life is addressed there may be additional resources considered such as medical care education proper sewage treatment waste disposal and energy supplies overpopulation places competitive stress on the basic life sustaining resources129 leading to a diminished quality of life127 directly related to maintaining the health of the human population is water supply and it is one of the resources that experience the biggest strain with the global population at about 7.125 billion and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water there is a demand for 14.25 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living united weather patterns elevation and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water without clean water good health is not a viable option besides drinking water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life in addition to drinking water water is also used for bathing washing clothes and dishes flushing toilets a variety of cleaning methods recreation watering lawns and farm irrigation irrigation poses one of the largest problems because without sufficient water to irrigate crops the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation in addition to water needed for crops and food there is limited land area dedicated to food production and not much more that is suitable to be added arable land needed to sustain the growing population is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply there are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population bashford 240 access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth no increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict only 38 of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture and there is not room for much more although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050 the plants may not be able to keep up biello food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded by trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land the soil becomes exhausted because the soil is exhausted it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before and is overall less productive therefore by using resources beyond a sustainable level the resource become nullified and ineffective which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource there must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles 130131132 an industrial area with a power plant south of yangzhous downtown china david pimentel has stated that with the imbalance growing between population numbers and vital life sustaining resources humans must actively conserve cropland freshwater energy and biological resources there is a need to develop renewable energy resources humans everywhere must understand that rapid population growth damages the earths resources and diminishes human well-being133134 these reflect the comments also of the united states geological survey in their paper the future of planet earth scientific challenges in the coming century as the global population continues to growpeople will place greater and greater demands on the resources of our planet including mineral and energy resources open space water and plant and animal resources earths natural wealth an audit by new scientist magazine states that many of the minerals that we use for a variety of products are in danger of running out in the near future135 a handful of geologists around the world have calculated the costs of new technologies in terms of the materials they use and the implications of their spreading to the developing world all agree that the planets booming population and rising standards of living are set to put unprecedented demands on the materials that only earth itself can provide135 limitations on how much of these materials is available could even mean that some technologies are not worth pursuing long term virgin stocks of several metals appear inadequate to sustain the modern developed world quality of life for all of earths people under contemporary technology136 on the other hand some cornucopian researchers such as julian l simon and bjrn lomborg believe that resources exist for further population growth in a 2010 study they concluded that there are not and will never be too many people for the planet to feed according to the independent137 some critics warn this will be at a high cost to the earth the technological optimists are probably correct in claiming that overall world food production can be increased substantially over the next few decadeshowever the environmental cost of what paul r and anne h ehrlich describe as turning the earth into a giant human feedlot could be severe a large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further deforestation loss of species soil erosion and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production138 since we are intimately dependent upon the living systems of the earth139140141 some scientists have questioned the wisdom of further expansion according to the millennium ecosystem assessment a four-year research effort by 1,360 of the worlds prominent scientists commissioned to measure the actual value of natural resources to humans and the world the structure of the worlds ecosystems changed more rapidly in the second half of the twentieth century than at any time in recorded human history and virtually all of earths ecosystems have now been significantly transformed through human actions142 ecosystem services particularly food production timber and fisheries are important for employment and economic activity intensive use of ecosystems often produces the greatest short-term advantage but excessive and unsustainable use can lead to losses in the long term a country could cut its forests and deplete its fisheries and this would show only as a positive gain to gdp despite the loss of capital assets if the full economic value of ecosystems were taken into account in decision-making their degradation could be significantly slowed down or even reversed143144 another study by the united nations environment programme unep called the global environment outlook145 which involved 1,400 scientists and took five years to prepare comes to similar conclusions it found that human consumption had far outstripped available resources each person on earth now requires a third more land to supply his or her needs than the planet can supplypageneeded it faults a failure to respond to or recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the people and the environment of the planet the systematic destruction of the earths natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged and where the bill we hand to our children may prove impossible to pay the reports authors say its objective is not to present a dark and gloomy scenario but an urgent call to action it warns that tackling the problems may affect the vested interests of powerful groups and that the environment must be moved to the core of decision-making 146pageneeded although all resources whether mineral or other are limited on the planet there is a degree of self-correction whenever a scarcity or high-demand for a particular kind is experienced for example in 1990 known reserves of many natural resources were higher and their prices lower than in 1970 despite higher demand and higher consumption whenever a price spike would occur the market tended to correct itself whether by substituting an equivalent resource or switching to a new technology147 fresh wateredit further information water crisis fresh water supplies on which agriculture depends are running low worldwide148149 this water crisis is only expected to worsen as the population increases150 potential problems with dependence on desalination are reviewed below however the majority of the worlds freshwater supply is contained in the polar icecaps and underground river systems accessible through springs and wells fresh water can be obtained from salt water by desalination for example malta derives two thirds of its freshwater by desalination a number of nuclear powered desalination plants exist151152 however the high costs of desalination especially for poor countries make impractical the transport of large amounts of desalinated seawater to interiors of large countries153 the cost of desalination varies israel is now desalinating water for a cost of 53 cents per cubic meter154 singapore at 49 cents per cubic meter155 in the united states the cost is 81 cents per cubic meter 3.06 for 1,000 gallons156 according to a 2004 study by zhou and tol one needs to lift the water by 2000 m or transport it over more than 1600km to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs desalinated water is expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high such as riyadh and harare in other places the dominant cost is desalination not transport this leads to somewhat lower costs in places like beijing bangkok zaragoza phoenix and of course coastal cities like tripoli thus while the study is generally positive about the technology for affluent areas that are proximate to oceans it concludes that desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions but not for places that are poor deep in the interior of a continent or at high elevation unfortunately that includes some of the places with biggest water problems157 another potential problem with desalination is the byproduction of saline brine which can be a major cause of marine pollution when dumped back into the oceans at high temperatures157 the worlds largest desalination plant is the jebel ali desalination plant phase 2 in the united arab emirates which can produce 300 million cubic metres of water per year158 or about 2500 gallons per second the largest desalination plant in the us is the one at tampa bay florida which began desalinating 25 million gallons 95000 m of water per day in december 2007 a 17 january 2008 article in the wall street journal states worldwide 13,080 desalination plants produce more than 12 billion gallons of water a day according to the international desalination association159 after being desalinated at jubail saudi arabia water is pumped 200 miles 320km inland though a pipeline to the capital city of riyadh160 however new data originating from the grace experiments and isotopic testing done by the iaea show that the nubian aquiferwhich is under the largest driest part of the earths surface has enough water in it to provide for at least several centuries in addition to this new and highly detailed maps of the earths underground reservoirs will be soon created from these technologies that will further allow proper budgeting of cheap water161 foodedit some scientists argue that there is enough food to support the world population162163 and some dispute this particularly if sustainability is taken into account164 many countries rely heavily on imports egypt and iran rely on imports for 40 of their grain supply yemen and israel import more than 90 and just 6 countries argentina australia canada france thailand and the usa supply 90 of grain exports in recent decades the us alone supplied almost half of world grain exports165166 a 2001 united nations report says population growth is the main force driving increases in agricultural demand but most recent expert assessments are cautiously optimistic about the ability of global food production to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future that is to say until approximately 2030 or 2050 assuming declining population growth rates167 however the observed figures for 2007 show an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world 923 million in 2007 versus 832 million in 1995.168 the more recent fao estimates point to an even more dramatic increase to 1.02 billion in 2009.169 global perspectiveedit further information 20072008 world food price crisis growth in food production has been greater than population growth the amounts of natural resources in this context are not necessarily fixed and their distribution is not necessarily a zero-sum game for example due to the green revolution and the fact that more and more land is appropriated each year from wild lands for agricultural purposes the worldwide production of food had steadily increased up until 1995 world food production per person was considerably higher in 2005 than 1961 as world population doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion daily calorie consumption in poor countries increased from 1,932 to 2,650 and the percentage of people in those countries who were malnourished fell from 45 to 18 this suggests that third world poverty and famine are caused by underdevelopment not overpopulation170 however others question these statistics171 from 1950 to 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the world grain production increased by over 250.172 the world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the green revolution and most believe that without the revolution there would be greater famine and malnutrition than the un presently documents43173 the number of people who are overweight has surpassed the number who are undernourished in a 2006 news story msnbc reported there are an estimated 800 million undernourished people and more than a billion considered overweight worldwide the us has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world174 however studies show that wealthy and educated people are far likelier to eat healthy food175 indicating obesity is a disease related to poverty and lack of education and excessive advertising of unhealthy eatables at cheaper cost high in calories with little nutritive value are consumed176177 percentage of population suffering from malnutrition by country according to united nations statistics the food and agriculture organization of the united nations states in its report the state of food insecurity in the world 2006 that while the number of undernourished people in the developing countries has declined by about three million a smaller proportion of the populations of developing countries is undernourished today than in 199092 17 against 20 furthermore faos projections suggest that the proportion of hungry people in developing countries could be halved from 199092 levels to 10 by 2015 the fao also states we have emphasized first and foremost that reducing hunger is no longer a question of means in the hands of the global community the world is richer today than it was ten years ago there is more food available and still more could be produced without excessive upward pressure on prices the knowledge and resources to reduce hunger are there what is lacking is sufficient political will to mobilize those resources to the benefit of the hungry178 as of 2008 the price of grain has increased due to more farming used in biofuels179 world oil prices at over 100 a barrel180 global population growth181 climate change182 loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development183184 and growing consumer demand in china and india185186 food riots have recently taken place in many countries across the world187188189 an epidemic of stem rust on wheat caused by race ug99 is currently spreading across africa and into asia and is causing major concern a virulent wheat disease could destroy most of the worlds main wheat crops leaving millions to starve the fungus has spread from africa to iran and may already be in afghanistan and pakistan190191192 food security will become more difficult to achieve as resources run out resources in danger of becoming depleted include oil phosphorus grain fish and water193194 the british scientist john beddington predicted in 2009 that supplies of energy food and water will need to be increased by 50 to reach demand levels of 2030.195196 according to the food and agriculture organization fao food supplies will need to be increased by 70 by 2050 to meet projected demands197 africaedit in africa if current trends of soil degradation and population growth continue the continent might be able to feed just 25 of its population by 2025 according to unus ghana-based institute for natural resources in africa198 hunger and malnutrition kill nearly 6 million children a year and more people are malnourished in sub-saharan africa this decade than in the 1990s according to a report released by the food and agriculture organization in sub-saharan africa the number of malnourished people grew to 203.5 million people in 200002 from 170.4 million 10 years earlier says the state of food insecurity in the world report in 2001 46.4 of people in sub-saharan africa were living in extreme poverty199 dhaka street crowds bangladesh asiaedit according to a 2004 article from the bbc china the worlds most populous country suffers from an obesity surge the article stated that altogether around 200 million people are thought to be overweight 22.8 of the population and 60 million 7.1 obese200 more recent data indicate chinas grain production peaked in the mid-1990s due to increased extraction of groundwater in the north china plain201 other countriesedit nearly half of indias children are malnourished according to recent government data202 japan may face a food crisis that could reduce daily diets to the austere meals of the 1950s believes a senior government adviser203 population as a function of food availabilityedit thinkers from a wide range of academic fields and political backgroundsincluding agricultural scientist david pimentel204 behavioral scientist russell hopfenberg205 right-wing anthropologist virginia abernethy206 ecologist garrett hardin207 ecologist and anthropologist peter farb journalist richard manning208 environmental biologist alan d thornhill209 cultural critic and writer daniel quinn210 and anarcho-primitivist john zerzan211propose that like all other animal populations human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply growing during an abundance of food and shrinking in times of scarcity proponents of this theory argue that every time food production is increased the population grows most human populations throughout history validate this theory as does the overall current global population populations of hunter-gatherers fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food the world human population began increasing after the neolithic revolution and its increased food supply this was subsequent to the green revolution followed by even more severely accelerated population growth which continues today often wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities however proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run peter farb for example has commented on the paradox that intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population212 daniel quinn has also focused on this phenomenon which he calls the food race comparable in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe to the nuclear arms race critics of this theory point out that in the modern era birth rates are lowest in the developed nations which also have the highest access to food in fact some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply the united nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas including germany italy japan and most of the states of the former soviet union is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.citation needed this shows that limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply however the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major exporters of food to poorer populations so that it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas allaby 1984 pimentel et al 1999 that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled204 regardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability the human population is on the global scale undeniably increasing213 as is the net quantity of human food produced a pattern that has been true for roughly 10,000 years since the human development of agriculture the fact that some affluent countries demonstrate negative population growth fails to discredit the theory as whole since the world has become a globalized system with food moving across national borders from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity hopfenberg and pimentels findings support both this204 and quinns direct accusation that first world farmers are fueling the third world population explosion214 additionally the hypothesis is not so simplistic as to be rejected by any single case study as in germanys recent population trends clearly other factors are at work to limit the population in wealthier areas contraceptive access educational programs cultural norms and most influentially differing economic realities from nation to nation as a result of water deficitsedit water deficits which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries may soon do the same in larger countries such as china or india if technology is not used215 the water tables are falling in scores of countries including northern china the us and india owing to widespread overdrafting beyond sustainable yieldscitation needed other countries affected include pakistan iran and mexico this overdrafting is already leading to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest even with the overpumping of its aquifers china has developed a grain deficit this effect has contributed in driving grain prices upward most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages one suggested solution is for population growth to be slowed quickly by investing heavily in female literacy and family planning services216 desalination is also considered a viable and effective solution to the problem of water shortages154155 after china and india there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits algeria egypt iran mexico and pakistan four of these already import a large share of their grain only pakistan remains self-sufficient but with a population expanding by 4 million a year it will also soon turn to the world market for grain166 landedit percentages of the earths surface covered by water dedicated to agriculture under conversion intact and used for human habitation while humans ourselves occupy only 0.05 of the earths total area our effects are felt on over one-quarter of the land the world resources institute states that agricultural conversion to croplands and managed pastures has affected some 3.3 billion hectares roughly 26 percent of the land area all totaled agriculture has displaced one-third of temperate and tropical forests and one-quarter of natural grasslands217218 forty percent of the land area is under conversion and fragmented less than one quarter primarily in the arctic and the deserts remains intact219 usable land may become less useful through salinization deforestation desertification erosion and urban sprawl global warming may cause flooding of many of the most productive agricultural areas220 the development of energy sources may also require large areas for example the building of hydroelectric dams thus available useful land may become a limiting factor by most estimates at least half of cultivable land is already being farmed and there are concerns that the remaining reserves are greatly overestimated221 high crop yield vegetables like potatoes and lettucecitation needed use less space on inedible plant parts like stalks husks vines and inedible leaves new varieties of selectively bred and hybrid plants have larger edible parts fruit vegetable grain and smaller inedible parts however many of these gain of agricultural technology are now historic and new advances are more difficult to achieve with new technologies it is possible to grow crops on some marginal land under certain conditions aquaculture could theoretically increase available area hydroponics and food from bacteria and fungi like quorn may allow the growing of food without having to consider land quality climate or even available sunlight although such a process may be very energy-intensive some argue that not all arable land will remain productive if used for agriculture because some marginal land can only be made to produce food by unsustainable practices like slash-and-burn agriculture even with the modern techniques of agriculture the sustainability of production is in question some countries such as the united arab emirates and particularly the emirate of dubai have constructed large artificial islands or have created large dam and dike systems like the netherlands which reclaim land from the sea to increase their total land area222 some scientists have said that in the future densely populated cities will use vertical farming to grow food inside skyscrapers223 the notion that space is limited has been decried by skeptics who point out that the earths population of roughly 6.8 billion people could comfortably be housed an area comparable in size to the state of texas in the united states about 269,000 square miles or 696,706.80 square kilometres224 however the impact of humanity extends over a far greater area than that required simply for housing fossil fuelsedit see also peak oil m king hubberts prediction of world petroleum production rates modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy population optimists have been criticized for failing to take into account the depletion of the petroleum required for the production of fertilizers and fuel for transportation as well as other fossil fuels225 in his 1992 book earth in the balance al gore wrote  it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over say a twenty-five-year period226 approximately half of the oil produced in the united states is refined into gasoline for use in internal combustion engines227 the report peaking of world oil production impacts mitigation and risk management commonly referred to as the hirsch report was created by request for the us department of energy and published in february 2005.228 some information was updated in 2007.229 it examined the time frame for the occurrence of peak oil the necessary mitigating actions and the likely impacts based on the timeliness of those actions it concludes that world oil peaking is going to happen and will likely be abrupt initiating a mitigation crash program 20 years before peaking appears to offer the possibility of avoiding a world liquid fuels shortfall for the forecast period optimists counter that fossil fuels will be sufficient until the development and implementation of suitable replacement technologiessuch as nuclear power or various sources of renewable energyoccurs230 methods of manufacturing fertilizers from garbage sewage and agricultural waste by using thermal depolymerization have been discovered231232 wealth and povertyedit main articles demographic transition and income and fertility as the worlds population has grown the percentage of the worlds population living on less than 1 per day adjusted for inflation has halved in 20 years the graph shows the 19812001 period the united nations indicates that about 850 million people are malnourished or starving116 and 1.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water97 some argue that earth may support 6 billion people but only if many live in misery the proportion of the worlds population living on less than 1 per day has halved in 20 years but these are inflation-unadjusted numbers and likely misleading233 since 1980 the global economy has grown by 380 percent but the number of people living on less than 5 a day increased by more than 1.1 billion234 the un human development report of 1997 states during the last 1520 years more than 100 developing countries and several eastern european countries have suffered from disastrous growth failures the reductions in standard of living have been deeper and more long-lasting than what was seen in the industrialised countries during the depression in the 1930s as a result the income for more than one billion people has fallen below the level that was reached 10 20 or 30 years ago similarly although the proportion of starving people in sub-saharan africa has decreased the absolute number of starving people has increased due to population growth the percentage dropped from 38 in 1970 to 33 in 1996 and was expected to be 30 by 2010.171 but the regions population roughly doubled between 1970 and 1996 to keep the numbers of starving constant the percentage would have dropped by more than half143235 graph of total fertility rate vs gdp ppp per

children in their lifetime have a per capita gdp of less than 5000 only in two countries with per capita gdp above 15,000 do women have on the average more than 2 children in their lifetime these are

correlation does not imply cause and effect and can be linked to the interplay of birth rates death rates and economic development poor living conditions can also cause a very bad effect on the population diseases such as malaria and hivaids can also contribute to this lack of nutrients poor sanitation and poor health institutions death rate and birth rate can also have a negative effect on the population environmentedit overpopulation has substantially adversely impacted the environment of earth starting at least as early as the 20th century127 according to the global footprint network today humanity uses the equivalent of 1.5 planets to provide the resources we use and absorb our waste239 there are also economic consequences of this environmental degradation in the form of ecosystem services attrition240 beyond the scientifically verifiable harm to the environment some assert the moral right of other species to simply exist rather than become extinct environmental author jeremy rifkin has said that our burgeoning population and urban way of life have been purchased at the expense of vast ecosystems and habitats  its no accident that as we celebrate the urbanization of the world we are quickly approaching another historic watershed the disappearance of the wild241 says peter raven former president of the american association for the advancement of science aaas in their seminal work aaas atlas of population environment where do we stand in our efforts to achieve a sustainable world clearly the past half century has been a traumatic one as the collective impact of human numbers affluence consumption per individual and our choices of technology continue to exploit rapidly an increasing proportion of the worlds resources at an unsustainable rate  during a remarkably short period of time we have lost a quarter of the worlds topsoil and a fifth of its agricultural land altered the composition of the atmosphere profoundly and destroyed a major proportion of our forests and other natural habitats without replacing them worst of all we have driven the rate of biological extinction the permanent loss of species up several hundred times beyond its historical levels and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century traffic congestion in ho chi minh city vietnam further even in countries which have both large population growth and major ecological problems it is not necessarily true that curbing the population growth will make a major contribution towards resolving all environmental problems242 however as developing countries with high populations become more industrialized pollution and consumption will invariably increase the worldwatch institute said in 2006 that the booming economies of china and india are planetary powers that are shaping the global biosphere the report states the worlds ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of china india japan europe and the united states as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way243 it is said that if china and india were to consume as much resources per capita as the united states in 2030 they would each require a full planet earth to meet their needs244 in the long term these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources245 and in the worst case a malthusian catastrophe many studies link population growth with emissions and the effect of climate change246247 warfare and conflictedit excessive growth may reduce output per worker repress levels of living for the masses and engender strife confucius 551 479 bc248 overpopulation in various countries has become a serious threat to the health of people and a grave obstacle to any attempt to organize peace on this planet albert einstein physicist 1879 1955249 it has been suggested250 that overpopulation leads to increased levels of tensions both between and within countries modern usage of the term lebensraum supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment the youth bulge theory criticism of this hypothesisedit the hypothesis that population pressure causes increased warfare has been recently criticized on the empirical grounds both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare andrey korotayev in collaboration with peter turchin has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis251 population and warfare are dynamical variables and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time that is unlagged korotayev and turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare focusing on internal warfare might be in both stateless and state societies next they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies early modern england han and tang china and the roman empire their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase with warfare peaks following population peaks furthermore they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density251252253 mitigation measuresedit there are several mitigation measures that have been or can be applied to reduce overpopulation all of these mitigations are ways to implement social norms overpopulation is an issue that threatens the state of the environment in the above-mentioned ways and therefore societies must make a change in order to reverse some of the environmental effects brought on by current social norms in societies like china the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple other societies have already begun to implement social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects the intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost a variety of print materials flyers brochures fact sheets stickers needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship sporting events local food markets schools and at car parks taxis bus stands254 such prompts work to introduce the problem so that social norms are easier to implement certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods an example of a country whose laws and norms are hindering the global effort to slow population growth is afghanistan the approval by afghan president hamid karzai of the shia personal status law in march 2009 effectively destroyed shia womens rights and freedoms in afghanistan under this law women have no right to deny their husbands sex unless they are ill and can be denied food if they do255 education and empowermentedit one option is to focus on education about overpopulation family planning and birth control methods and to make birth-control devices like male and female condoms pills and intrauterine devices easily available worldwide nearly 40 of pregnancies are unintended some 80 million unintended pregnancies each year256 an estimated 350 million women in the poorest countries of the world either did not want their last child do not want another child or want to space their pregnancies but they lack access to information affordable means and services to determine the size and spacing of their families in the united states in 2001 almost half of pregnancies were unintended257 in the developing world some 514,000 women die annually of complications from pregnancy and abortion258 with 86 of these deaths occurring in the sub-saharan africa region and south asia259 additionally 8 million infants die many because of malnutrition or preventable diseases especially from lack of access to clean drinking water260 womens rights and their reproductive rights in particular are issues regarded to have vital importance in the debate261 the only ray of hope i can see and its not much is that wherever women are put in control of their lives both politically and socially where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions birth rate falls women dont want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die davidattenborough262 egypt announced a program to reduce its overpopulation by family planning education and putting women in the workforce it was announced in june 2008 by the minister of health and population hatem el-gabali the government has set aside 480 million egyptian pounds about 90 million us for the program263 the business magnate ted turner proposed a voluntary non-imposed one-child family scenario a pledge two or fewer campaign is run by population matters a uk population concern organisation in which people are encouraged to limit themselves to small family size birth regulationsedit overpopulation is related to the issue of birth control some nations like the peoples republic of china use strict measures to reduce birth rates religious and ideological opposition to birth control has been cited as a factor contributing to overpopulation and poverty264 sanjay gandhi son of late prime minister of india indira gandhi implemented a forced sterilization programme between 1975 and 1977 officially men with two children or more had to submit to sterilization but there was a greater focus on sterilizing women than sterilizing men some unmarried young men political opponents and ignorant men were also believed to have been sterilizedcitation needed this program is still remembered and criticized in india and is blamed for creating a public aversion to family planning which hampered government programmes for decades265 urban designer michael e arth has proposed a choice-based marketable birth license plan he calls birth credits266 birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in zero population growth if that allotment was determined to be one child for example then the first child would be free and the market would determine what the license fee for each additional child would cost extra credits would expire after a certain time so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators the actual cost of the credits would only be a fraction of the actual cost of having and raising a child so the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society267 another choice-based approach similar to arths birth credits is financial compensation or other benefits free goods andor services by the state or state-owned companies offered to people who voluntarily undergo sterilization such compensation has been offered in the past by the government of india268 in 2014 the united nations estimated there is an 80 likelihood that the worlds population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100 most of the worlds expected population increase will be in africa and southern asia africas population is expected to rise from the current one billion to three or four billion by 2100 and asia could add another billion in the same period269 because the median age of africans is so low eg uganda 15 years old birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately for countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child bearing age to have their families267 an example of demographic momentum is china which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries267 infectious agentsedit there are also natural diseases such as chlamydia gonorrhea and even some diseases that produce no physical discomfort at all such as some specific adeno-associated viruses270 that may also cause sterilization of males andor females in the population271272273 whereas the natural occurrence of these diseases is not sufficient to significantly reduce the population problem large-scale production of these diseases and human-induced release of such diseases could quite well be used as a mitigation measurecitation needed extraterrestrial settlementedit main article space colonization see also space advocacy various scientists and science fiction authors have contemplated that overpopulation on earth may be remedied in the future by the use of extraterrestrial settlements in the 1970s gerard k oneill suggested building space habitats that could support 30,000 times the carrying capacity of earth using just the asteroid belt and that the solar system as a whole could sustain current population growth rates for a thousand years274 marshall savage 1992 1994 has projected a human population of five quintillion 5 x 1018 throughout the solar system by 3000 with the majority in the asteroid belt275 freeman dyson 1999 favours the kuiper belt as the future home of humanity suggesting this could happen within a few centuries276 in mining the sky johns lewis suggests that the resources of the solar system could support 10 quadrillion 1016 people in an interview stephen hawking claimed that overpopulation is a threat to human existence and our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet earth but to spread out into space277 k eric drexler famous inventor of the futuristic concept of molecular nanotechnology has suggested in engines of creation that colonizing space will mean breaking the malthusian limits to growth for the human species it may be possible for other parts of the solar system to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future geoffrey landis of nasas glenn research center in particular has pointed out that at cloud-top level venus is the paradise planet as one could construct aerostat habitats and floating cities there easily based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense venusian atmosphere venus would like also saturn uranus and neptune in the upper layers of their atmospheres even afford a gravitation almost exactly as strong as that on earth see colonization of venus278 many science fiction authors including carl sagan arthur c clarke279 and isaac asimov280 have argued that shipping any excess population into space is not a viable solution to human overpopulation according to clarke the population battle must be fought or won here on earth279 the problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space as shown in books such as mining the sky281 but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to solve overpopulation on earth however gerard k oneills calculations show that earth could offload all new population growth with a launch services industry about the same size as the current airline industry282 the startram concept by james r powell the co-inventor of maglev transport and others envisions a capability to send up to 4 million people a decade to space per facility283 ahypothetical

despite the increase in population density within cities and the emergence of megacities un habitat states in its reports that urbanization may be the best compromise in the face of global population growth284 cities concentrate human activity within limited areas limiting the breadth of environmental damage285 but this mitigating influence can only be achieved if urban planning is significantly improved286 and city services are properly maintained graph galleryedit afghanistan shows a classic youth bulge angola shows the same even more pronounced china had an extreme youth bulge until the
