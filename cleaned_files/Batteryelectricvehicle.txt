combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged operate in charge-sustaining mode and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking4 hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phev and run as bevs during their charge-depleting mode phevs with a series powertrain are also called

production battery electric vehicles and electric car use by country an electric car is a plug-in battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motors although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges recharging can also take significant lengths of time for journeys within a single battery
