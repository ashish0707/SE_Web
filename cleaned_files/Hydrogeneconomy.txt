the hydrogen economy is a proposed system of delivering energy using hydrogen the term hydrogen economy was coined by john bockris during a talk he gave in 1970 at general motors gm technical center1 the concept was proposed earlier by geneticist jbs haldane2 proponents of a hydrogen economy advocate hydrogen as a potential fuel for motive power3 including cars and boats and on-board auxiliary power stationary power generation eg for the energy needs of buildings and as an energy storage medium eg for interconversion from excess electric power generated off-peak molecular hydrogen of the sort that can be used as a fuel does not occur naturally in convenient reservoirs nonetheless it can be generated by steam reformation of hydrocarbons water electrolysis or by other methods4 the spike in attention for the concept during the 2000s has been repeatedly described as a hype by critics neutral observers and advocates of further research and development567 some small-scale initiatives from that period are still trying to enable hydrogen-fuelled land transport however this application faces many issues given fundamentally low conversion efficiencies and competition from other

hydrogen economy a hydrogen economy was proposed by the university of michigan to solve some of the negative effects of using hydrocarbon fuels where the carbon is released to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide carbon monoxide unburnt hydrocarbons etc modern interest in the hydrogen economy can generally be traced to a 1970 technical report by lawrence w jones of the university of michigan10 in the current hydrocarbon economy transportation is fueled primarily by petroleum burning of hydrocarbon fuels emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants the supply of economically usable hydrocarbon resources in the world is limited and the demand for hydrocarbon fuels is increasing particularly in china india and other developing countries proponents of a world-scale hydrogen economy argue that hydrogen can be an environmentally cleaner source of energy to end-users particularly in transportation applications without release of pollutants such as particulate matter or carbon dioxide at the point of end use a 2004 analysis asserted that most of the hydrogen supply chain pathways would release significantly less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than would gasoline used in hybrid electric vehicles and that significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions would be possible if carbon capture or carbon sequestration methods were utilized at the site of energy or hydrogen production11 hydrogen has a high energy density by weight but has a low energy density by volume when not highly compressed or liquified an otto cycle internal-combustion engine running on hydrogen is said to have a maximum efficiency of about 38 8 higher than a gasoline internal-combustion engine12 the combination of the fuel cell and electric motor is 2-3 times more efficient than an internal-combustion engine13 however the high capital costs of fuel cells about 5,500kw in 2002,14 are one of the major obstacles of its development meaning that the fuel cell is only technically but not economically more efficient than an internal-combustion engine15 other technical obstacles include hydrogen storage issues16 and the purity requirement of hydrogen used in fuel cells with current technology an operating fuel cell requires the purity of hydrogen to be as high as 99.999 on the other hand hydrogen engine conversion technology is more economical than fuel cells17 current hydrogen marketedit timeline hydrogen production is a large and growing industry globally some 57 million metric tons of hydrogen1819 equal to about 170million tons of oil equivalent were produced in 2004 the growth rate is around 10 per year within the united states 2004 production was about 11million metric tons mt an average power flow of 48gigawatts for comparison the average electric production in 2003 was some 442gw as of 2005 the economic value of all hydrogen produced worldwide is about 135billion per year20 there are two primary uses for hydrogen today about half is used in the haber process to produce ammonia nh3 which is then used directly or indirectly as fertilizer because both the world population and the intensive agriculture used to support it are growing ammonia demand is growing the other half of current hydrogen production is used to convert heavy petroleum sources into lighter fractions suitable for use as fuels this latter process is known as hydrocracking hydrocracking represents an even larger growth area since rising oil prices encourage oil companies to extract poorer source material such as tar sands and oil shale the scale economies inherent in large-scale oil refining and fertilizer manufacture make possible on-site production and captive use smaller quantities of merchant hydrogen are manufactured and delivered to end users as well if energy for hydrogen production were available from wind solar fission or fusion nuclear power etc use of the substance for hydrocarbon synfuel production could expand captive use of hydrogen by a factor of 5 to 10 present us use of hydrogen for hydrocracking is roughly 4mt per year it is estimated that 37.7mtyr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end us dependence on foreign oil importation21 and less than half this figure to end dependence on middle east oil coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in us oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in north america22 as of 2004update and 2016 96 of global hydrogen production is from fossil fuels23 48 from natural gas 30 from oil and 18 from coal water electrolysis accounts for only 4.24 the distribution of production reflects the effects of thermodynamic constraints on economic choices of the four methods for obtaining hydrogen partial combustion of natural gas in a ngcc natural gas combined cycle power plant offers the most efficient chemical pathway and the greatest off-take of usable heat energy needs reference the large market and sharply rising prices in fossil fuels have also stimulated great interest in alternate cheaper means of hydrogen production2526 as of 2002 most hydrogen is produced on site and the cost is approximately 0.70kg and if not produced on site the cost of liquid hydrogen is about 2.20kg to 3.08kg.27 production storage infrastructureedit main article hydrogen technologies further information timeline of hydrogen technologies todays hydrogen is mainly produced 90 from fossil sources28 linking its centralized production to a fleet of light-duty fuel cell vehicles would require the siting and construction of a distribution infrastructure with large investment of capitalcitation needed further the technological challenge of providing safe energy-dense storage of hydrogen on board the vehicle must be overcome to provide sufficient range between fillupscitation needed methods of productionedit main article hydrogen production molecular hydrogen is not available on earth in convenient natural reservoirs most hydrogen in the lithosphere is bonded to oxygen in water manufacturing elemental hydrogen does require the consumption of a hydrogen carrier such as a fossil fuel or water the former carrier consumes the fossil resource and produces carbon dioxide but often requires no further energy input beyond the fossil fuel decomposing water the latter carrier requires electrical or heat input generated from some primary energy source fossil fuel nuclear power or a renewable energy hydrogen can also be produced by refining the effluent from geothermal sources in the lithosphere29 hydrogen produced by zero emission renewable energy sources such as electrolysis of water using wind power solar power hydro power wave power or tidal power is referred to as green hydrogen30 hydrogen produced by non-renewable energy sources may be referred to as brown hydrogen hydrogen produced as a waste by-product or industrial by-product is sometimes referred to as grey hydrogen current production methodsedit hydrogen is industrially produced from steam reforming which uses fossil fuels such as natural gas oil or coal31 the energy content of the produced hydrogen is less than the energy content of the original fuel some of it being lost as excessive heat during production steam reforming leads to carbon dioxide emissions in the same way as a car engine would do a small part 4 in 2006 is produced by electrolysis using electricity and water consuming approximately 50kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilogram of hydrogen produced kvrner-processedit the kvrner-process or kvaerner carbon black hydrogen process cbh28 is a method developed in the 1980s by a norwegian company of the same name for the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons cnhm such as methane natural gas and biogas of the available energy of the feed approximately 48 is contained in the hydrogen 40 is contained in activated carbon and 10 in superheated steam32 biological productionedit main article biological hydrogen production algae fermentative hydrogen production is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to biohydrogen manifested by a diverse group bacteria using multi enzyme systems involving three steps similar to anaerobic conversion dark fermentation reactions do not require light energy so they are capable of constantly producing hydrogen from organic compounds throughout the day and night photofermentation differs from dark fermentation because it only proceeds in the presence of light for example photo-fermentation with rhodobacter sphaeroides sh2c can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen33 electrohydrogenesis is used in microbial fuel cells where hydrogen is produced from organic matter eg from sewage or solid matter 34 while 0.2 - 0.8 v is applied biological hydrogen can be produced in an algae bioreactor in the late 1990s it was discovered that if the algae is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen ie normal photosynthesis to the production of hydrogen35 biological hydrogen can be produced in bioreactors that use feedstocks other than algae the most common feedstock being waste streams the process involves bacteria feeding on hydrocarbons and excreting hydrogen and co2 the co2 can be sequestered successfully by several methods leaving hydrogen gas a prototype hydrogen bioreactor using waste as a feedstock is in operation at welchs grape juice factory in north east pennsylvania biocatalysed electrolysisedit besides regular electrolysis electrolysis using microbes is another possibility with biocatalysed electrolysis hydrogen is generated after running through the microbial fuel cell and a variety of aquatic plants can be used these include reed sweetgrass cordgrass rice tomatoes lupines and algae 36 electrolysis of wateredit electrolysis of water ship hydrogen challenger hydrogen can be made via high pressure electrolysis low pressure electrolysis of water or a range of other emerging electrochemical processes such as high temperature electrolysis or carbon assisted electrolysis37 current best processes have an efficiency of 50 to 80,383940 so that 1kg of hydrogen which has a specific energy of 143 mjkg about 40 kwhkg requires 5079 kwh of electricity at 0.08kwh approx 4kg it is with traditional methods 3 to 10 times costlier than steam reformation of natural gas27 the price difference is due to the efficiency of direct conversion of fossil fuels to produce hydrogen rather than burning fuel to produce electricity high-pressure electrolysisedit high pressure electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by decomposition of water h2o into oxygen o2 and hydrogen gas h2 by means of an electric current being passed through the water the difference with a standard electrolyzer is the compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 bar 1740-2900 psi 1220 mpa41 by pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser through a process known as chemical compression the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated4 the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3.42 european largest 1 400 000kga high-pressure electrolysis of water acaline technology hydrogen production plant is operating at kokkola finland43 high-temperature electrolysisedit main article high-temperature electrolysis hydrogen can be generated from energy supplied in the form of heat and electricity through high-temperature electrolysis hte because some of the energy in hte is supplied in the form of heat less of the energy must be converted twice from heat to electricity and then to chemical form and so potentially far less energy is required per kilogram of hydrogen produced while nuclear-generated electricity could be used for electrolysis nuclear heat can be directly applied to split hydrogen from water high temperature 9501000c gas cooled nuclear reactors have the potential to split hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat research into high-temperature nuclear reactors may eventually lead to a hydrogen supply that is cost-competitive with natural gas steam reforming general atomics predicts that hydrogen produced in a high temperature gas cooled reactor htgr would cost 1.53kg in 2003 steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at 1.40kg in 2005 natural gas prices hydrogen costs 2.70kg high-temperature electrolysis has been demonstrated in a laboratory at 108mj thermal per kilogram of hydrogen produced44 but not at a commercial scale in addition this is lower-quality commercial grade hydrogen unsuitable for use in fuel cells45 photoelectrochemical water splittingedit using electricity produced by photovoltaic systems offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen water is broken into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysisa photoelectrochemical cell pec process which is also named artificial photosynthesis william ayers at energy conversion devices demonstrated and patented the first multijunction high efficiency photoelectrochemical system for direct splitting of water in 1983.46 this group demonstrated direct water splitting now referred to as an artificial leaf or wireless solar water splitting with a low cost thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silcon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved off the back metal substrate a nafion membrane above the multijunction cell provided a path for ion transport their patent also lists a variety of other semiconductor multijunction materials for the direct water splitting in addition to amorphous silicon and silicon germanium alloys research continues towards developing high-efficiency multi-junction cell technology at universities and the photovoltaic industry if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system the reaction is in just one step which can improve efficiency4748 concentrating solar thermaledit very high temperatures are required to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen a catalyst is required to make the process operate at feasible temperatures heating the water can be achieved through the use of concentrating solar power hydrosol-2 is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the plataforma solar de almera in spain which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200c to heat water hydrosol ii has been in operation since 2008 the design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept as a result it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to the megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to heliostat fields fields of sun-tracking mirrors of a suitable size49 photoelectrocatalytic productionedit a method studied by thomas nann and his team at the university of east anglia consists of a gold electrode covered in layers of indium phosphide inp nanoparticles they introduced an iron-sulfur complex into the layered arrangement which when submerged in water and irradiated with light under a small electric current produced hydrogen with an efficiency of 60.50 in 2015 it was reported that panasonic corp has developed a photocatalyst based on niobium nitride that can absorb 57 of sunlight to support the decomposition of water to produce hydrogen gas51 the company plans to achieve commercial application as early as possible not before 2020 thermochemical productionedit there are more than 35252 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting53 around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle ceriumiv oxide-ceriumiii oxide cycle zinc zinc-oxide cycle sulfur-iodine cycle copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity54 these processes can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis typical in the range from 35 - 49 lhv efficiency thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered because the direct chemical path is more efficient none of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels although several have been demonstrated in laboratories hydrogen as a byproduct of other chemical processesedit the industrial production of chlorine and caustic soda by electrolysis generates a sizable amount of hydrogen as a byproduct in the port of antwerp a 1mw demonstration fuel cell power plant is powered by such byproduct this unit has been operational since late 2011.55 the excess hydrogen is often managed with a hydrogen pinch analysis storageedit main article hydrogen storage although molecular hydrogen has very high energy density on a mass basis partly because of its low molecular weight as a gas at ambient conditions it has very low energy density by volume if it is to be used as fuel stored on board the vehicle pure hydrogen gas must be stored in an energy-dense form to provide sufficient driving range pressurized hydrogen gasedit increasing gas pressure improves the energy density by volume making for smaller but not lighter container tanks see pressure vessel achieving higher pressures necessitates greater use of external energy to power the compression the mass of the hydrogen tanks needed for compressed hydrogen reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle because it is a small molecule hydrogen tends to diffuse through any liner material intended to contain it leading to the embrittlement or weakening of its container the most common method of on board hydrogen storage in todays demonstration vehicles is as a compressed gas at pressures of roughly 700bar 70mpa liquid hydrogenedit alternatively higher volumetric energy density liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used however liquid hydrogen is cryogenic and boils at 20.268k 252.882c or 423.188f cryogenic storage cuts weight but requires large liquification energies the liquefaction process involving pressurizing and cooling steps is energy intensive the liquefied hydrogen has lower energy density by volume than gasoline by approximately a factor of four because of the low density of liquid hydrogen there is actually more hydrogen in a liter of gasoline 116grams than there is in a liter of pure liquid hydrogen 71grams liquid hydrogen storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off ice may form around the tank and help corrode it further if the liquid hydrogen tank insulation fails storage as hydrideedit distinct from storing molecular hydrogen hydrogen can be stored as a chemical hydride or in some other hydrogen-containing compound hydrogen gas is reacted with some other materials to produce the hydrogen storage material which can be transported relatively easily at the point of use the hydrogen storage material can be made to decompose yielding hydrogen gas as well as the mass and volume density problems associated with molecular hydrogen storage current barriers to practical storage schemes stem from the high pressure and temperature conditions needed for hydride formation and hydrogen release for many potential systems hydriding and dehydriding kinetics and heat management are also issues that need to be overcome a french company mcphy energy 3 is developing the first industrial product based on magnesium hydrate already sold to some major clients such as iwatani and enel adsorptionedit a third approach is to adsorb molecular hydrogen on the surface of a solid storage material unlike in the hydrides mentioned above the hydrogen does not dissociaterecombine upon chargingdischarging the storage system and hence does not suffer from the kinetic limitations of many hydride storage systems hydrogen densities similar to liquefied hydrogen can be achieved with appropriate adsorbent materials some suggested adsorbents include activated carbon nanostructured carbons including cnts mofs and hydrogen clathrate hydrate underground hydrogen storageedit underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground caverns salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields5657 large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by imperial chemical industries ici for many years without any difficulties58 the european project hyunder59 indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it cant be covered by pumped-storage hydroelectricity and compressed air energy storage systems60 power to gasedit power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel there are 2 methods the first is to use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid the second less efficient method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane see natural gas using electrolysis and the sabatier reaction the excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen fuel cell maker hydrogenics and natural gas distributor enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in canada61 pipeline storageedit a natural gas network may be used for the storage of hydrogen before switching to natural gas the german gas networks were operated using towngas which for the most part consisted of hydrogen the storage capacity of the german natural gas network is more than 200,000 gwh which is enough for several months of energy requirement by comparison the capacity of all german pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 gwh the transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss 0.1 than in a power network 8 the use of the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen was studied by naturalhy62 infrastructureedit main article hydrogen infrastructure praxair hydrogen plant the hydrogen infrastructure would consist mainly of industrial hydrogen pipeline transport and hydrogen-equipped filling stations like those found on a hydrogen highway hydrogen stations which were not situated near a hydrogen pipeline would get supply via hydrogen tanks compressed hydrogen tube trailers liquid hydrogen trailers liquid hydrogen tank trucks or dedicated onsite production because of hydrogen embrittlement of steel and corrosion6364 natural gas pipes require internal coatings or replacement in order to convey hydrogen techniques are well-known over 700 miles of hydrogen pipeline currently exist in the united states although expensive pipelines are the cheapest way to move hydrogen hydrogen gas piping is routine in large oil-refineries because hydrogen is used to hydrocrack fuels from crude oil hydrogen piping can in theory be avoided in distributed systems of hydrogen production where hydrogen is routinely made on site using medium or small-sized generators which would produce enough hydrogen for personal use or perhaps a neighborhood in the end a combination of options for hydrogen gas distribution may succeed while millions of tons of elemental hydrogen are distributed around the world each year in various ways bringing hydrogen to individual consumers would require an evolution of the fuel infrastructure for example according to gm 70 of the us population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little public access to that hydrogen the same study however shows that building the infrastructure in a systematic way is much more doable and affordable than most people think for example one article has noted that hydrogen stations could be put within every 10 miles in metro los angeles and on the highways between la and neighboring cities like palm springs las vegas san diego and santa barbara for the cost of a starbucks latte for every one of the 15 million residents living in these areas65 a key tradeoff centralized vs distributed productionedit in a future full hydrogen economy primary energy sources and feedstock would be used to produce hydrogen gas as stored energy for use in various sectors of the economy producing hydrogen from primary energy sources other than coal oil and natural gas would result in lower production of the greenhouse gases characteristic of the combustion of these fossil energy resources one key feature of a hydrogen economy would be that in mobile applications primarily vehicular transport energy generation and use could be decoupled the primary energy source would need no longer travel with the vehicle as it currently does with hydrocarbon fuels instead of tailpipes creating dispersed emissions the energy and pollution could be generated from point sources such as large-scale centralized facilities with improved efficiency this would allow the possibility of technologies such as carbon sequestration which are otherwise impossible for mobile applications alternatively distributed energy generation schemes such as small scale renewable energy sources could be used possibly associated with hydrogen stations aside from the energy generation hydrogen production could be centralized distributed or a mixture of both while generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen production efficiency difficulties in high-volume long range hydrogen transportation due to factors such as hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy in such a scenario small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical distribution grid while hydrogen generation efficiency is likely to be lower than for centralized hydrogen generation losses in hydrogen transport could make such a scheme more efficient in terms of the primary energy used per kilogram of hydrogen delivered to the end user the proper balance between hydrogen distribution and long-distance electrical distribution is one of the primary questions that arises about the hydrogen economy again the dilemmas of production sources and transportation of hydrogen can now be overcome using on site home business or fuel station generation of hydrogen from off grid renewable sources4 distributed electrolysisedit distributed electrolysis would bypass the problems of distributing hydrogen by distributing electricity instead it would use existing electrical networks to transport electricity to small on-site electrolysers located at filling stations however accounting for the energy used to produce the electricity and transmission losses would reduce the overall efficiency natural gas combined cycle power plants which account for almost all construction of new electricity generation plants in the united states generate electricity at efficiencies of 60 percent or greatercitation needed increased demand for electricity whether due to hydrogen cars or other demand would have the marginal impact of adding new combined cycle power plants on this basis distributed production of hydrogen would be roughly 40 efficient however if the marginal impact is referred to todays power grid with an efficiency of roughly 40 owing to its mix of fuels and conversion methods the efficiency of distributed hydrogen production would be roughly 25.66 the distributed production of hydrogen in this fashion would be expected to generate air emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide at various points in the supply chain eg electrolysis transportation and storage such externalities as pollution must be weighed against the potential advantages of a hydrogen economy fuel cells as alternative to internal combustionedit main articles fuel cell and hydrogen vehicle one of the main offerings of a hydrogen economy is that the fuel can replace the fossil fuel burned in internal combustion engines and turbines as the primary way to convert chemical energy into kinetic or electrical energy hereby eliminating greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from that engine although hydrogen can be used in conventional internal combustion engines fuel cells being electrochemical have a theoretical efficiency advantage over heat engines fuel cells are more expensive to produce than common internal combustion engines some types of fuel cells work with hydrocarbon fuels67 while all can be operated on pure hydrogen in the event that fuel cells become price-competitive with internal combustion engines and turbines large gas-fired power plants could adopt this technology hydrogen gas must be distinguished as technical-grade five times pure which is suitable for applications such as fuel cells and commercial-grade which has carbon- and sulfur-containing impurities but which can be produced by the much cheaper steam-reformation process fuel cells require high-purity hydrogen because the impurities would quickly degrade the life of the fuel cell stack much of the interest in the hydrogen economy concept is focused on the use of fuel cells to power electric cars current hydrogen fuel cells suffer from a low power-to-weight ratio68 fuel cells are much more efficient than internal combustion engines and produce no harmful emissions if a practical method of hydrogen storage is introduced and fuel cells become cheaper they can be economically viable to power hybrid fuel cellbattery vehicles or purely fuel cell-driven ones the economic viability of fuel cell powered vehicles will improve as the hydrocarbon fuels used in internal combustion engines become more expensive because of the depletion of easily accessible reserves or economic accounting of environmental impact through such measures as carbon taxes other fuel cell technologies based on the exchange of metal ions eg zinc-air fuel cells are typically more efficient at energy conversion than hydrogen fuel cells but the widespread use of any electrical energy chemical energy electrical energy systems would necessitate the production of electricity since the 2003 state of the union address when the notion of the hydrogen economy came to national prominence in the united states there has been a steady chorus of naysayers most recently in 2013 lux research inc issued a report that stated the dream of a hydrogen economy  is no nearer it concluded that capital cost not hydrogen supply will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 gw by 2030 providing a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption except in niche applications luxs analysis speculated that by 2030 pem stationary market will reach 1 billion while the vehicle market including forklifts will reach a total of 2 billion69 use as an automotive fuel and system efficiencyedit main article hydrogen fuel an accounting of the energy utilized during a thermodynamic process known as an energy balance can be applied to automotive fuels with todays technology the manufacture of hydrogen via steam reforming can be accomplished with a thermal efficiency of 75 to 80percent additional energy will be required to liquefy or compress the hydrogen and to transport it to the filling station via truck or pipeline the energy that must be utilized per kilogram to produce transport and deliver hydrogen ie its well-to-tank energy use is approximately 50mj using technology available in 2004 subtracting this energy from the enthalpy of one kilogram of hydrogen which is 141mj and dividing by the enthalpy yields a thermal energy efficiency of roughly 60.70 gasoline by comparison requires less energy input per gallon at the refinery and comparatively little energy is required to transport it and store it owing to its high energy density per gallon at ambient temperatures well-to-tank the supply chain for gasoline is roughly 80 efficient wang 2002 another grid-based method of supplying hydrogen would be to use electrical to run electrolysers roughly 6 of electricity is lost during transmission along power lines and the process of converting the fossil fuel to electricity in the first place is roughly 33 percent efficient thus if efficiency is the key determinant it would be unlikely hydrogen vehicles would be fueled by such a method and indeed viewed this way electric vehicles would appear to be a better choice however as noted above hydrogen can be produced from a number of feedstocks in centralized or distributed fashion and these afford more efficient pathways to produce and distribute the fuel a study of the well-to-wheels efficiency of hydrogen vehicles compared to other vehicles in the norwegian energy system indicates that hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles fcv tend to be about a third as efficient as evs when electrolysis is used with hydrogen internal combustion engines ice being barely a sixth as efficient even in the case where hydrogen fuel cells get their hydrogen from natural gas reformation rather than electrolysis and evs get their power from a natural gas power plant the evs still come out ahead 35 to 25 and only 13 for a h2 ice this compares to 14 for a gasoline ice 27 for a gasoline ice hybrid and 17 for a diesel ice also on a well-to-wheels basis71 hydrogen has been called one of the least efficient and most expensive possible replacements for gasoline petrol in terms of reducing greenhouse gases other technologies may be less expensive and more quickly implemented7273 a comprehensive study of hydrogen in transportation applications has found that there are major hurdles on the path to achieving the vision of the hydrogen economy the path will not be simple or straightforward11 although ford motor company and french renault-nissan cancelled their hydrogen car rd efforts in 2008 and 2009 respectively7475 they signed a 2009 letter of intent with the other manufacturers and now gmbh in september 2009 supporting the commercial introduction of fcvs by 2015.76 a study by the carbon trust for the uk department of energy and climate change suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver uk transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation however the technologies face very difficult challenges in terms of cost performance and policy 77 hydrogen safetyedit main article hydrogen safety hydrogen has one of the widest explosiveignition mix range with air of all the gases with few exceptions such as acetylene silane and ethylene oxide that means that whatever the mix proportion between air and hydrogen a hydrogen leak will most likely lead to an explosion not a mere flame when a flame or spark ignites the mixture this makes the use of hydrogen particularly dangerous in enclosed areas such as tunnels or underground parking78 pure hydrogen-oxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are nearly invisible to the naked eye so a flame detector is needed to detect if a hydrogen leak is burning hydrogen is odorless and leaks cannot be detected by smell hydrogen codes and standards are codes and standards for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications there are codes and standards for the safe handling and storage of hydrogen for example the standard for the installation of stationary fuel cell power systems from the national fire protection association codes and standards have repeatedly been identified as a major institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies and developing a hydrogen economy to enable the commercialization of hydrogen in consumer products new model building codes and equipment and other technical standards are developed and recognized by federal state and local governments79 one of the measures on the roadmap is to implement higher safety standards like early leak detection with hydrogen sensors80 the canadian hydrogen safety program concluded that hydrogen fueling is as safe as or safer than compressed natural gas cng fueling81 the european commission has funded the first higher educational program in the world in hydrogen safety engineering at the university of ulster it is expected that the general public will be able to use hydrogen technologies in everyday life with at least the same level of safety and comfort as with todays fossil fuels environmental concernsedit there are many concerns regarding the environmental effects of the manufacture of hydrogen hydrogen is made either by electrolysis of water or by fossil fuel reforming reforming a fossil fuel leads to a higher emissions of carbon dioxide compared with direct use of the fossil fuel in an internal combustion engine similarly if hydrogen is produced by electrolysis from fossil-fuel powered generators increased carbon dioxide is emitted in comparison with direct use of the fossil fuel using renewable energy source to generate hydrogen by electrolysis would require greater energy input than direct use of the renewable energy to operate electric vehicles because of the extra conversion stages and losses in distribution hydrogen as transportation fuel however is mainly used for fuel cells that do not produce greenhouse gas emission but water there have also been some concerns over possible problems related to hydrogen gas leakage82 molecular hydrogen leaks slowly from most containment vessels it has been hypothesized that if significant amounts of hydrogen gas h2 escape hydrogen gas may because of ultraviolet radiation form free radicals h in the stratosphere these free radicals would then be able to act as catalysts for ozone depletion a large enough increase in stratospheric hydrogen from leaked h2 could exacerbate the depletion process however the effect of these leakage problems may not be significant the amount of hydrogen that leaks today is much lower by a factor of 10100 than the estimated 1020 figure conjectured by some researchers for example in germany the leakage rate is only 0.1 less than the natural gas leak rate of 0.7 at most such leakage would likely be no more than 12 even with widespread hydrogen use using present technology82 costsedit in 2004 the production of unit of hydrogen fuel by steam reformation or electrolysis was approximately 3 to 6 times more expensive than the production of an equivalent unit of fuel from natural gas83 when evaluating costs fossil fuels are generally used as the reference the energy content of these fuels is not a product of human effort and so has no cost assigned to it only the extraction refining transportation and production costs are considered on the other hand the energy content of a unit of hydrogen fuel must be manufactured and so has a significant cost on top of all the costs of refining transportation and distribution systems which use renewably generated electricity more directly for example in trolleybuses or in battery electric vehicles may have a significant economic advantage because there are fewer conversion processes required between primary energy source and point of use the barrier to lowering the price of high purity hydrogen is a cost of more than 35 kwh of electricity used to generate each kilogram of hydrogen gas hydrogen produced by steam reformation costs approximately three times the cost of natural gas per unit of energy produced this means that if natural gas costs 6million btu then hydrogen will be 18million btu also producing hydrogen from electrolysis with electricity at 5 centskwh will cost 28million btu about 1.5 times the cost of hydrogen from natural gas note that the cost of hydrogen production from electricity is a linear function of electricity costs so electricity at 10 centskwh means that hydrogen will cost 56million btu83 demonstrated advances in electrolyser and fuel cell technology by itm power 84 are claimed to have made significant in-roads into addressing the cost of electrolysing water to make hydrogen cost reduction would make hydrogen from off-grid renewable sources economic for refueling vehicles hydrogen pipelines are more expensive85 than even long-distance electric lines hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel hydrogen embrittlement which increases maintenance costs leakage rates and material costs the difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased material costs but higher pressure pipes require proportionally more material setting up a hydrogen economy would require huge investments in the infrastructure to store and distribute hydrogen to vehicles in contrast battery electric vehicles which are already publicly available would not necessitate immediate expansion of the existing infrastructure for electricity transmission and distribution power plant capacity that now goes unused at night could be used for recharging electric vehicles a study conducted by the pacific northwest national laboratory for the us department of energy in december 2006 found that the idle off-peak grid capacity in the us would be sufficient to power 84 of all vehicles in the us if they all were immediately replaced with electric vehicles86 different production methods each have differing associated investment and marginal costs the energy and feedstock could originate from a multitude of sources ie natural gas nuclear solar wind biomass coal other fossil fuels and geothermal natural gas at small scale uses steam reformation requires 15.9million cubic feet 450,000m3 of gas which if produced by small 500kgday reformers at the point of dispensing ie the filling station would equate to 777,000 reformers costing 1trillion and producing 150million tons of hydrogen gas annually obviates the need for distribution infrastructure dedicated to hydrogen 3.00 per gge gallons of gasoline equivalent nuclear provides energy for electrolysis of water would require 240,000tons of unenriched uranium thats 2,000 600-megawatt power plants which would cost 840billion or about 2.50 per gge87 solar provides energy for electrolysis of water would require 2,500kwh of sun per square meter 113million 40-kilowatt systems which would cost 22trillion or about 9.50 per gge wind provides energy for electrolysis of water at 7meters per second average wind speed it would require 1million 2-mw wind turbines which would cost 3trillion or about 3.00 per gge biomass gasification plants would produce gas with steam reformation 1.5billion tons of dry biomass 3,300 plants which would require 113.4million acres 460,000km of farm to produce the biomass 565billion in cost or about 1.90 per gge coal futuregen plants use coal gasification then steam reformation requires 1billion tons of coal or about 1,000 275-megawatt plants with a cost of about 500billion or about 1 per gge doe cost targets88 examples and pilot programsedit a mercedes-benz o530 citaro powered by hydrogen fuel cells in brno czech republic several domestic us automobile manufactures have committed to develop vehicles using hydrogen the distribution of hydrogen for the purpose of transportation is currently being tested around the world particularly in portugal iceland norway denmark germany california japan and canada but the cost is very high some hospitals have installed combined electrolyser-storage-fuel cell units for local emergency power these are advantageous for emergency use because of their low maintenance requirement and ease of location compared to internal combustion driven generatorscitation needed iceland has committed to becoming the worlds first hydrogen economy by the year 2050.89 iceland is in a unique position presently it imports all the petroleum products necessary to power its automobiles and fishing fleet iceland has large geothermal resources so much that the local price of electricity actually is lower than the price of the hydrocarbons that could be used to produce that electricity iceland already converts its surplus electricity into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements in 2002 it produced 2,000tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis primarily for the production of ammonia nh3 for fertilizer ammonia is produced transported and used throughout the world and 90 of the cost of ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it iceland is also developing an aluminium-smelting industry aluminium costs are driven primarily by the cost of the electricity to run the smelters either of these industries could effectively export all of icelands potential geothermal electricity neither industry directly replaces hydrocarbons reykjavk iceland had a small pilot fleet of city buses running on compressed hydrogen90 and research on powering the nations fishing fleet with hydrogen is under way for more practical purposes iceland might process imported oil with hydrogen to extend it rather than to replace it altogether the reykjavk buses are part of a larger program hyfleetcute91 operating hydrogen fueled buses in eight european cities hyfleetcute buses were also operated in beijing china and perth australia see below a pilot project demonstrating a hydrogen economy is operational on the norwegian island of utsira the installation combines wind power and hydrogen power in periods when there is surplus wind energy the excess power is used for generating hydrogen by electrolysis the hydrogen is stored and is available for power generation in periods when there is little windcitation needed a joint venture between nrel and xcel energy is combining wind power and hydrogen power in the same way in colorado92 hydro in newfoundland and labrador are converting the current wind-diesel power system on the remote island of ramea into a wind-hydrogen hybrid power systems facility93 a similar pilot project on stuart island uses solar power instead of wind power to generate electricity when excess electricity is available after the batteries are full hydrogen is generated by electrolysis and stored for later production of electricity by fuel cell94 the uk started a fuel cell pilot program in january 2004 the program ran two fuel cell buses on route25 in london until december 2005 and switched to route rv1 until january 2007.95 the hydrogen expedition is currently working to create a hydrogen fuel cell-powered ship and using it to circumnavigate the globe as a way to demonstrate the capability of hydrogen fuel cells96 western australias department of planning and infrastructure operated three daimler chrysler citaro fuel cell buses as part of its sustainable transport energy for perth fuel cells bus trial in perth97 the buses were operated by path transit on regular transperth public bus routes the trial began in september 2004 and concluded in september 2007 the buses fuel cells used a proton exchange membrane system and were supplied with raw hydrogen from a bp refinery in kwinana south of perth the hydrogen was a byproduct of the refinerys industrial process the buses were refueled at a station in the northern perth suburb of malaga the united nations industrial development organization unido and the turkish ministry of energy and natural resources have signed in 2003 a 40 million trust fund agreement for the creation of the international centre for hydrogen energy technologies unido-ichet in istanbul which started operation in 2004.98 a hydrogen forklift a hydrogen cart and a mobile house powered by renewable energies are being demonstrated in unido-ichets premises an uninterruptible power supply system has been working since april 2009 in the headquarters of istanbul sea buses company hydrogen-using alternatives to a fully distributive hydrogen economyedit for other energy alternatives see main article energy development hydrogen is simply a method to store and transmit energy various alternative energy transmission and storage scenarios which begin with hydrogen production but do not use it for all parts of the store and transmission infrastructure may be more economic in both near and far term these include ammonia economyedit an alternative to gaseous hydrogen as an energy carrier is to bond it with nitrogen from the air to produce ammonia which can be easily liquefied transported and used directly or indirectly as a clean and renewable fuel99100 hydrogen production of greenhouse-neutral alcoholedit main articles methanol economy and ethanol economy the methanol economy is a synfuel production energy plan which may begin with hydrogen production hydrogen in a full hydrogen economy was initially suggested as a way to make renewable energy in non-polluting form available to automobiles however a theoretical alternative to address the same problem is to produce hydrogen centrally and immediately use it to make liquid fuels from a co2 source this would eliminate the requirement to transport and store the hydrogen the source could be co2 that is produced by fuel-burning power plants in order to be greenhouse-neutral the source for co2 in such a plan would need to be from air biomass or other source of co2 which is already in or to be released into the air101 direct methanol fuel cells are in commercial use though as of august 2011 they are not efficientcitation needed the electrical grid plus synthetic methanol fuel cellsedit main article carbon neutral fuel many of the hybrid strategies described above using captive hydrogen to generate other more easily usable fuels might be more effective than hydrogen-production alone short term energy storage meaning the energy is used not long after it has been captured may be best accomplished with battery or even ultracapacitor storage longer term energy storage meaning the energy is used weeks or months after capture may be better done with synthetic methane or alcohols which can be stored indefinitely at relatively low cost and even used directly in some type of fuel cells for electric vehicles these strategies dovetail well with the recent interest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or phevs which use a hybrid strategy of electrical and fuel storage for their energy needs hydrogen storage has been proposed by somecitation needed to be optimal in a narrow range of energy storage time probably somewhere between a few days and a few weeks this range is subject to further narrowing with any improvements in battery technology it is always possible that some kind of breakthrough in hydrogen storage or generation could occur but this is unlikely given that the physical and chemical limitations of the technical choices are fairly well understoodcitation needed captive hydrogen synthetic methane production sng synthetic natural gasedit in a similar way as with synthetic alcohol production hydrogen can be used on site to directly nonbiologically produce greenhouse-neutral gaseous fuels thus captive-hydrogen-mediated production of greenhouse-neutral methane has been proposed note that this is the reverse of the present method of acquiring hydrogen from natural methane but one that does not require ultimate burning and release of fossil fuel carbon captive hydrogen and carbon dioxide from for example ccs carbon capture storage may be used onsite to synthesize methane using the sabatier reaction this is about 60 efficient and with the round trip reducing to 20 to 36 depending on the method of fuel utilization this is even lower than hydrogen but the storage costs drop by at least a factor of 3 because of methanes higher boiling point and higher energy density liquid methane has 3.2 times the energy density of liquid hydrogen and is easier to store compactly additionally the pipe infrastructure natural gas pipelines are already in place natural-gas-powered vehicles already exist and are known to be easier to adapt from existing internal engine technology than internal combustion autos running directly on hydrogen experience with natural gas powered vehicles shows that methane storage is inexpensive once one has accepted the cost of conversion to store the fuel however the cost of alcohol storage is even lower so this technology would need to produce methane at a considerable savings with regard to alcohol production ultimate mature prices of fuels in the competing technologies are not presently known but both are expected to offer substantial infrastructural savings over attempts to transport and use hydrogen directly it has been proposed in a hypothetical renewable energy dominated energy system to use the excess electricity generated by wind solar photovoltaic hydro marine currents and others to produce hydrogen by electrolysis of water then combine it with co2 make methane natural gas102103 hydrogen would firstly be used onsite in fuel cells chp or for transportation due to its greater efficiency of production and then methane created which could then be injected into the existing gas network to generate electricity and heat on demand to overcome low points of renewable energy production the process described would be to create hydrogen which could partly be used directly in fuel cells and the addition of carbon dioxide co2 possibly from beccs bio-energy with carbon capture storage 104 via the sabatier reaction to create methane as follows co2 4h2 ch4 2h2o note after combusting methane in ccgt the co2 would again be captured ie ccs and used to produce new methane see alsoedit energy portal
