utilities and policymakers using the social sciences to gain insights into energy consumer behavior can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based climate and energy options this could facilitate more efficient energy use renewable energy commercialization and carbon emission reductions1 national energy policyedit measures used to produce an energy policyedit a national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that countrys laws treaties and agency directives the energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures statement of national policy regarding energy planning energy generation transmission and usage legislation on commercial energy activities trading transport storage etc legislation affecting energy use such as efficiency standards emission standards instructions for state-owned energy sector assets and organizations active participation in co-ordination of and incentives for mineral fuels exploration see geological survey and other energy-related research and development policy command fiscal policies related to energy products and services taxes exemptions subsidies  energy security and international policy measures such as international energy sector treaties and alliances general international trade agreements special relations with energy-rich countries including military presence andor domination frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch see energy crisis current energy policies also address environmental issues see climate change particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws2 some governments state explicit energy policy but declared or not each government practices some type of energy policy economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool see economic model poles factors within an energy policyedit there are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy the chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are what is the extent of energy self-sufficiency for this nation where future energy sources will derive how future energy will be consumed eg among sectors what fraction of the population will be acceptable to endure energy poverty what are the goals for future energy intensity ratio of energy consumed to gdp what is the reliability standard for distribution reliability what environmental externalities are acceptable and are forecast what form of portable energy is forecast eg sources of fuel for motor vehicles how will energy efficient hardware eg hybrid vehicles household appliances be encouraged how can the national policy drive province state and municipal functions what specific mechanisms eg taxes incentives manufacturing standards are in place to implement the total policy what future consequences there will be for national security and foreign policy3 state province or municipal energy policyedit even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in plural influential entities such as municipal or regional governments and energy industries will each exercise policy policy measures available to these entities are lesser in sovereignty but may be equally important to national measures in fact there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level such as monitoring energy conservation practices in the process of building construction which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal building codes although can appear basic federal legislation americasedit braziledit main article energy policy of brazil brazil is the 10th largest energy consumer in the world and the largest in south america at the same time it is

europeedit european unionedit main article energy policy of the european union although the european union has legislated set targets and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years and evolved out of the european coal and steel community the concept of introducing a mandatory common european union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the european council on october 27 2005 in london following this the first policy proposals energy for a changing world were published by the european commission on january 10 2007 the most well known energy policy objectives in the eu are 202020 objectives binding for all eu member states the eu is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20 reduce greenhouse gases by 20 and increase energy efficiency by 20.7 germanyedit main article energiewende in germany in september 2010 the german government adopted a set of ambition goals to transform their national energy system and to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 by 2050 relative to 1990.8 this transformation become known as the energiewende subsequently the government decided to the phase-out the nations fleet of nuclear reactors to be complete by 2022.9 as of 2014 the country is making steady progress on this transition10 united kingdomedit main article energy policy of the united kingdom the energy policy of the united kingdom has achieved success in reducing energy intensity but still really high reducing energy poverty and maintaining energy supply reliability to datewhen the united kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for future years but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective the way to be so efficient as france is still hard regarding energy self sufficiency the united kingdom policy does not address this issue other than to concede historic energy self sufficiency is currently ceasing to exist due to the decline of the north sea oil production with regard to transport the united kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging public transport links with cities despite encountering problems with high speed trains which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul european flights the policy does not however significantly encourage hybrid vehicle use or ethanol fuel use options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption regarding renewable energy the united kingdom has goals for wind and tidal energy the white paper on energy 2007 set the target that 20 of the uks energy must come from renewable sources by 2020 the soviet union and russiaedit main articles energy policy of the soviet union and energy

fraction of the gas crude oil and petroleum product requirements and recently the need to import coal as well and indoor urban and regional environmental impacts necessitating the need for the adoption of cleaner fuels and cleaner technologies in recent years these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms restructuring and a focus on energy conservation see also jatropha

sustainable basis1 with rapid change of global as well as domestic situation the policy was updated in 2004 the updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the
