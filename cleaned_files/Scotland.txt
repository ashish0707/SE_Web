surrounded by the atlantic ocean with the north sea to the east and the north channel and irish sea to the south-west in addition to the mainland the country is made up of more than 790 islands16 including the northern isles and the hebrides the kingdom of scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the early middle ages and continued to exist until 1707 by inheritance in 1603 james vi king of scots became king of england and king of ireland thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the kingdom of england on 1 may 1707 to create the new kingdom of great britain1718 the treaty of union was agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin acts of union 1707 passed by the parliaments of both kingdoms despite popular opposition and anti-union riots in edinburgh glasgow and elsewhere1920 the union also created a new parliament of great britain which succeeded both the parliament of scotland and the parliament of england in 1801 great britain itself entered into a political union with the kingdom of ireland to create the united kingdom of great britain and ireland the parliament of ireland merging with that of great britain to form the parliament of the united kingdom since the creation of the irish free state in 1922 the united kingdom has comprised great britain and northern ireland the monarchy of the united kingdom continues to use a variety of styles titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union scotland including the royal standard of scotland the royal coat of arms used in scotland together with its associated royal standard royal titles including that of duke of rothesay certain great officers of state the chivalric order of the thistle and since 1999 reinstating a ceremonial role for the crown of scotland after a 292-year hiatus21 scotlands legal system has also remained separate from those of england and wales and northern ireland and scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in public and private law22 the continued existence of legal educational religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the uk have all contributed to the continuation of scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with england23 edinburgh the countrys capital and second-largest city was the hub of the scottish enlightenment of the

cities and now lies at the centre of the greater glasgow conurbation other major urban areas are aberdeen and dundee scottish waters consist of a large sector of the north atlantic and the north sea25 containing the largest oil reserves in the european union this has given aberdeen the third-largest city in scotland the title of europes oil capital26 following a referendum in 1997 a scottish parliament was re-established in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members having authority over many areas of domestic policy the scottish national party snp which supports

word scotia land of the gaels was initially used to refer to ireland33 by the 11th century at the latest scotia was being used to refer to gaelic-speaking scotland north of the river forth alongside albania or albany both derived from the gaelic alba34 the use of the words scots and scotland to encompass all of what is now scotland became common in the late middle ages17 early history main article prehistoric scotland see also timeline of prehistoric scotland repeated glaciations which covered the entire land mass of modern scotland destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the mesolithic period it is believed the first post-glacial groups of hunter-gatherers arrived in scotland around 12,800 years ago as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation3536 scara brae a neolithic settlement located on the west coast of mainland orkney the groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on scottish soil around 9,500 years ago and the first villages around 6,000 years ago the well-preserved village of skara brae on the mainland of orkney dates from this period neolithic habitation burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the northern isles and western isles where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone37 the 2009 discovery in scotland of a 4000-year-old tomb with burial treasures at forteviot near perth the capital of a pictish kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries ad is unrivalled anywhere in britain it contains the remains of an early bronze age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark it was also discovered for the first time that early bronze age people placed flowers in their graves3839 scotland may have been part of a late bronze age maritime trading culture called the atlantic bronze age which included other celtic nations and the areas that became england france spain and portugal40414243 in the winter of 1850 a severe storm hit scotland causing widespread damage and over 200 deaths44 in the bay of skaill the storm stripped the earth from a large irregular knoll known as skerrabra when the storm cleared local villagers found the outline of a village consisting of a number of small houses without roofs4445 william watt of skaill the local laird began an amateur excavation of the site but after uncovering four houses the work was abandoned in 1868.45 the site remained undisturbed until 1913 when during a single weekend the site was plundered by a party with shovels who took away an unknown quantity of artefacts44 in 1924 another storm swept away part of one of the houses and it was determined the site should be made secure and more seriously investigated44 the job was given to university of edinburghs professor vere gordon childe who travelled to skara brae for the first time in mid-192744 roman influence main article scotland during the roman empire tablet found at boness dated ca ad142 depicting roman cavalryman trampling picts now at the nms the written protohistory of scotland began with the arrival of the roman empire in southern and central great britain when the romans occupied what is now england and wales administering it as a province called britannia roman invasions and occupations of southern scotland were a series of brief interludes according to the roman historian tacitus the caledonians turned to armed resistance on a large scale attacking roman forts and skirmishing with their legions in a surprise night-attack the caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole 9th legion until it was saved by agricolas cavalry46 in ad 8384 the general gnaeus julius agricola defeated the caledonians at the battle of mons graupius tacitus wrote that before the battle the caledonian leader calgacus gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the last of the free and accused the romans of making the world a desert and calling it peace freely translated46 after the roman victory roman forts were briefly set along the gask ridge close to the highland line only cawdor near inverness is known to have been constructed beyond that line three years after the battle the roman armies had withdrawn to the southern uplands47 the romans erected hadrians wall to control tribes on both sides of the wall48 so the limes britannicus became the northern border of the roman empire although the army held the antonine wall in the central lowlands for two short periods the last during the reign of emperor septimius severus from 208 until 210.49 the roman military occupation of a significant part of what is now northern scotland lasted only about 40 years although their influence on the southern section of the country occupied by brythonic tribes such as the votadini and damnonii would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries the welsh term hen ogledd old north is used by scholars to describe what is now the north of england and the south of scotland during its habitation by brittonic-speaking people around ad 500 to 800.48 according to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries the gaelic kingdom of dl riata was founded in the 6th century in western scotland5051 the traditional view is that settlers from ireland founded the kingdom bringing gaelic language and culture with them however recently some archaeologists have argued against this view saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites52 middle ages main articles scotland in the early middle ages scotland in the high middle ages and scotland in the late middle ages the class i pictish stone at aberlemno known as aberlemno 1 or the serpent stone the kingdom of the picts based in fortriu by the 6th century was the state that eventually became known as alba or scotland the development of pictland according to the historical model developed by peter heather was a natural response to roman imperialism53 another view places emphasis on the battle of dun nechtain and the reign of bridei m beli 671693 with another period of consolidation in the reign of engus mac fergusa 732761.54 the kingdom of the picts as it was in the early 8th century when bede was writing was largely the same as the kingdom of the scots in the reign of alexander i 11071124 however by the tenth century the pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as gaelic culture and had developed a traditional story of an irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty cined mac ailpn kenneth macalpin555657 from a base of territory in eastern scotland north of the river forth and south of the river oykel the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south by the 12th century the kings of alba had added to their territories the english-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of gaelic-speaking galloway and norse-speaking caithness by the end of the 13th century the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders however processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured scotland looked very different in the later middle ages the push for this change was the reign of david i and the davidian revolution feudalism government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns called burghs began in this period these institutions and the immigration of french and anglo-french knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdoms original territory in the east became like the newly acquired south-east english-speaking while the rest of the country retained the gaelic language apart from the northern isles of orkney and shetland which remained under norse rule until 1468.585960 the scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries there was relative peace with england trade and educational links were well developed with the continent and at the height of this cultural flowering john duns scotus was one of europes most important and influential philosophers the wallace monument commemorates william wallace the 13th-century scottish hero the death of alexander iii in march 1286 followed by that of his granddaughter margaret maid of norway broke the centuries-old succession line of scotlands kings and shattered the 200-year golden age that began with david i edward i of england was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the scottish crown and he organised a process known as the great cause to identify the most legitimate claimant john balliol was pronounced king in the great hall of berwick castle on 17 november 1292 and inaugurated at scone on 30 november st andrews day edward i who had coerced recognition as lord paramount of scotland the feudal superior of the realm steadily undermined johns authority61 in 1294 balliol and other scottish lords refused edwards demands to serve in his army against the french instead the scottish parliament sent envoys to france to negotiate an alliance scotland and france sealed a treaty on 23 october 1295 known as the auld alliance 12951560 war ensued and king john was deposed by edward who took personal control of scotland andrew moray and william wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to english rule in what became known as the wars of scottish independence 12961328.62 the nature of the struggle changed significantly when robert the bruce earl of carrick killed his rival john comyn on 10 february 1306 at greyfriars kirk in dumfries63 he was crowned king as robert i less than seven weeks later robert i battled to restore scottish independence as king for over 20 years beginning by winning scotland back from the norman english invaders piece by piece victory at the battle of bannockburn in 1314 proved the scots had regained control of their kingdom in 1315 edward bruce brother of the king was briefly appointed high king of ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful scottish invasion of ireland aimed at strengthening scotlands position in its wars against england in 1320 the worlds first documented declaration of independence the declaration of arbroath won the support of pope john xxii leading to the legal recognition of scottish sovereignty by the english crown however war with england continued for several decades after the death of bruce a civil war between the bruce dynasty and their long-term comyn-balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century although the bruce dynasty was successful david iis lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew robert ii to come to the throne and establish the stewart dynasty5964 the stewarts ruled scotland for the remainder of the middle ages the country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the scottish renaissance to the reformation this was despite continual warfare with england the increasing division between highlands and lowlands and a large number of royal minorities6465 this period was the height of the franco-scottish alliance the scots guard la garde cossaise was founded in 1418 by charles vii of france the scots soldiers of the garde cossaise fought alongside joan of arc against england during the hundred years war66 in march 1421 a franco-scots force under john stewart 2nd earl of buchan and gilbert de lafayette defeated a larger english army at the battle of baug three years later at the battle of verneuil the french and scots lost around 7000 men67 the scottish intervention contributed to frances victory in the war early modern era main article scotland in the early modern era james vi succeeded to the english and irish thrones in 1603 in 1502 james iv of scotland signed the treaty of perpetual peace with henry vii of england he also married henrys daughter margaret tudor setting the stage for the union of the crowns for henry the marriage into one of europes most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new tudor royal line68 a decade later james made the fateful decision to invade england in support of france under the terms of the auld alliance he was the last british monarch to die in battle at the battle of flodden69 within a generation the auld alliance was ended by the treaty of edinburgh france agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces in the same year 1560 john knox realised his goal of seeing scotland become a protestant nation and the scottish parliament revoke papal authority in scotland70 mary queen of scots a catholic and former queen of france was forced to abdicate in 1567.71 in 1603 james vi king of scots inherited the thrones of the kingdom of england and the kingdom of ireland and became king james i of england and ireland and left edinburgh for london72 with the exception of a short period under the protectorate scotland remained a separate state but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the covenanters over the form of church government the glorious revolution of 168889 saw the overthrow of the king james vii of scotland and ii of england by the english parliament in favour of william and mary as late as the 1690s scotland experienced famine which reduced the population of parts of the country by at least 20 per cent73 in 1698 the scots attempted an ambitious project to secure a trading colony on the isthmus of panama almost every scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the darien scheme its failure bankrupted these landowners but not the burghs nevertheless the nobles bankruptcy along with the threat of an english invasion played a leading role in convincing the scots elite to back a union with england7475 on 22 july 1706 the treaty of union was agreed between representatives of the scots parliament and the parliament of england and the following year twin acts of union were passed by both parliaments to create the united kingdom of great britain with effect from 1 may 1707.18 18th century david moriers depiction of the battle of culloden with trade tariffs with england now abolished trade blossomed especially with colonial america the clippers belonging to the glasgow tobacco lords were the fastest ships on the route to virginia until the american war of independence in 1776 glasgow was the worlds premier tobacco port dominating world trade76 the disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the scottish lowlands and the ancient clans of the scottish highlands grew amplifying centuries of division the deposed jacobite stuart claimants had remained popular in the highlands and north-east particularly amongst non-presbyterians including roman catholics and episcopalian protestants however two major jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the house of hanover from the british throne the threat of the jacobite movement to the united kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the battle of culloden great britains last pitched battle this defeat paved the way for large-scale removals of the indigenous populations of the highlands and islands known as the highland clearances the scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution made scotland into an intellectual commercial and industrial powerhouse77so much so voltaire said we look to scotland for all our ideas of civilisation78 with the demise of jacobitism and the advent of the union thousands of scots mainly lowlanders took up numerous positions of power in politics civil service the army and navy trade economics colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent british empire historian neil davidson notes after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by scots in political life particularly outside scotland davidson also states far from being peripheral to the british economy scotland or more precisely the lowlands lay at its core79 19th century main article scotland in the modern era shipping on the clyde by john atkinson grimshaw 1881 the scottish reform act 1832 increased the number of scottish mps and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes80 from the mid-century there were increasing calls for home rule for scotland and the post of secretary of state for scotland was revived81 towards the end of the century prime ministers of scottish descent included william e gladstone82 and the earl of rosebery83 in the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by keir hardies success in the mid lanarkshire by-election 1888 leading to the foundation of the scottish labour party which was absorbed into the independent labour party in 1895 with hardie as its first leader84 glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as the second city of the empire after london85 after 1860 the clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron after 1870 made of steel which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world it became the worlds pre-eminent shipbuilding centre86 the industrial developments while they brought work and wealth were so rapid that housing town-planning and provision for public health did not keep pace with them and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad with overcrowding high infant mortality and growing rates of tuberculosis87 walter scott whose waverley novels helped define scottish identity in the 19th century while the scottish enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century88 disproportionately large scottish contributions to british science and letters continued for another 50 years or more thanks to such figures as the physicists james clerk maxwell and lord kelvin and the engineers and inventors james watt and william murdoch whose work was critical to the technological developments of the industrial revolution throughout britain89 in literature the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was walter scott his first prose work waverley in 1814 is often called the first historical novel90 it launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise scottish cultural identity91 in the late 19th century a number of scottish-born authors achieved international reputations such as robert louis stevenson arthur conan doyle j m barrie and george macdonald92 scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture the glasgow school which developed in the late 19th century and flourished in the early 20th century produced a distinctive blend of influences including the celtic revival the arts and crafts movement and japonisme which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental europe and helped define the art nouveau style proponents included architect and artist charles rennie mackintosh93 this period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture in the 1820s as part of the romantic revival tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite not just in scotland but across europe9495 prompted by the popularity of macphersons ossian cycle9697 and then walter scotts waverley novels98 however the highlands remained very poor and traditional99 the desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the highland clearances in which much of the population of the highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed principally so that they could be used for sheep farming the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout britain but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under scots law the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system and the brutality of many evictions100 one result was a continuous exodus from the landto the cities or further afield to england canada america or australia101 the population of scotland grew steadily in the 19th century from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.102 even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs as a result during the period 18411931 about 2 million scots migrated to north america and australia and another 750,000 scots relocated to england103 the disruption assembly painted by david octavius hill after prolonged years of struggle in the kirk in 1834 the evangelicals gained control of the general assembly and passed the veto act which allowed congregations to reject unwanted intrusive presentations to livings by patrons the following ten years conflict of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts the result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by dr thomas chalmers known as the great disruption of 1843 roughly a third of the clergy mainly from the north and highlands formed the separate free church of scotland104 in the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the free church as the rigid calvinists broke away to form the free presbyterian church in 1893.105 catholic emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of irish immigrants particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s mainly to the growing lowland centres like glasgow led to a transformation in the fortunes of catholicism in 1878 despite opposition a roman catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country and catholicism became a significant denomination within scotland105 industrialisation urbanisation and the disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools from 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship and in 1872 scotland moved to a system like that in england of state-sponsored largely free schools run by local school boards106 the historic university of glasgow became a leader in british higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes as opposed to the upper class107 the university of st andrews pioneered the admission of women to scottish universities from 1892 scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century108 early 20th century royal scots with a captured japanese hinomaru yosegaki flag burma 1945 scotland played a major role in the british effort in the first world war it especially provided manpower ships machinery fish and money109 with a population of 4.8 million in 1911 scotland sent over half a million men to the war of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease and 150,000 were seriously wounded110 field marshal sir douglas haig was britains commander on the western front the war saw the emergence of a radical movement called red clydeside led by militant trades unionists formerly a liberal stronghold the industrial districts switched to labour by 1922 with a base among the irish catholic working class districts women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues however the reds operated within the labour party and had little influence in parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.111 the shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939 the interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas and high unemployment112 indeed the war brought with it deep social cultural economic and political dislocations thoughtful scots pondered their declension as the main social indicators such as poor health bad housing and long-term mass unemployment pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best or even a downward spiral service abroad on behalf of the empire lost its allure to ambitious young people who left scotland permanently the heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem and no one offered workable solutions the despair reflected what finlay 1994 describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the second world war113 the second world war brought renewed prosperity despite extensive bombing of cities by the luftwaffe it saw the invention of radar by robert watson-watt which was invaluable in the battle of britain as was the leadership at raf fighter command of air chief marshal sir hugh dowding114 since 1945 after 1945 scotlands economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition inefficient industry and industrial disputes115 only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance economic factors contributing to this recovery include a resurgent financial services industry electronics manufacturing see silicon glen116 and the north sea oil and gas industry117 the introduction in 1989 by margaret thatchers government of the community charge widely known as the poll tax one year before the rest of the united kingdom contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct scottish control over domestic affairs118 following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997 the scotland act 1998119 was passed by the united kingdom parliament to establish a devolved scottish parliament and scottish government with responsibility for most laws specific to scotland120 education the scottish education system has always remained distinct from the rest of the united kingdom with a characteristic emphasis on a broad education121 in the 15th century the humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the education act 1496 which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn perfyct latyne resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite122 in the reformation the 1560 first book of discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish but this proved financially impossible123 in 1616 an act in privy council commanded every parish to establish a school124 by the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands but in the highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas125 education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the education act 1872.126 geography and

ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation from a geological perspective the country has three main sub-divisions the highlands and islands lie to the north and west of the highland boundary fault which runs from arran to stonehaven this part of scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the cambrian and precambrian which were uplifted during the later caledonian orogeny it is interspersed with igneous intrusions of a more recent age remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the cairngorms and skye cuillins a significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of old red sandstones found principally along the moray firth coast the highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the british isles are found here scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups shetland orkney and the inner hebrides and outer hebrides there are numerous bodies of freshwater including loch lomond and loch ness some parts of the coastline consist of machair a low lying dune pasture land the central lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising paleozoic formations many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled scotlands industrial revolution are found this area has also experienced intense volcanism arthurs seat in edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano this area is relatively low-lying although even here hills such as the ochils and campsie fells are rarely far from view the southern uplands are a range of hills almost 200 kilometres 124mi long interspersed with broad valleys they lie south of a second fault line the southern uplands fault that runs from girvan to dunbar133134135 the geological foundations largely comprise silurian deposits laid down some 4500million years ago the high point of the southern uplands is merrick with an elevation of 843m 2,766ft.17136137138 the southern uplands is home to the uks highest village wanlockhead 430m or 1,411ft above sea level135 climate tiree one of the sunniest locations in scotland main article climate of scotland the climate of scotland is temperate and oceanic and tends to be very changeable as it is warmed by the gulf stream from the atlantic it has much milder winters but cooler wetter summers than areas on similar latitudes such as labrador southern scandinavia the moscow region in russia and the kamchatka peninsula on the opposite side of eurasia however temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the uk with the coldest ever uk temperature of 27.2c 17.0f recorded at braemar in the grampian mountains on 11 february 1895.139 winter maxima average 6c 42.8f in the lowlands with summer maxima averaging 18c 64.4f the highest temperature recorded was 32.9c 91.2f at greycrook scottish borders on 9 august 2003.140 the west of scotland is usually warmer than the east owing to the influence of atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the north sea tiree in the inner hebrides is one of the sunniest places in the country it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in may 1975.140 rainfall varies widely across scotland the western highlands of scotland are the wettest with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000mm 118.1in.141 in comparison much of lowland scotland receives less than 800mm 31.5in annually142

per year142 flora and fauna a mountain hare lepus timidus photographed in findhorn valley may 2004 main articles fauna of scotland and flora of scotland scotlands wildlife is typical of the north-west of europe although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx brown bear wolf elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times there are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as gannets144 the golden eagle is something of a national icon145 on the high mountain tops species including ptarmigan mountain hare and stoat can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months146 remnants of the native scots pine forest exist147 and within these areas the scottish crossbill the uks only endemic bird species and vertebrate can be found alongside capercaillie wildcat red squirrel and pine marten148149150 in recent years various animals have been re-introduced including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975 the red kite in the 1980s,151152 and more recently there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar today much of the remaining native caledonian forest lies within the cairngorms national park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across scotland on the west coast remnants of ancient celtic rainforest still remain particularly on the taynish peninsula in argyll these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout scottish history153154 the flora of the country is varied incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species however large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals155 the uks tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside loch fyne argyll in the 1870s and the fortingall yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in europe156157158 although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards scotlands substantial bryophyte flora is of global

scottish parliament scotlands head of state is the monarch of the united kingdom currently queen elizabeth ii since 1952 the regnal numbering elizabeth ii caused controversy around the time of the queens coronation because there had never been an elizabeth i in scotland a legal action maccormick v lord advocate 1953 sc 396 was brought to contest the right of the queen to entitle herself elizabeth ii within scotland arguing that this was a breach of article 1 of the treaty of union the crown won the case it was decided that future british monarchs would be numbered according to either their english or their scottish predecessors whichever number is higher196 for instance any future king james would be styled james viiisince the last scottish king james was james vii also james ii of england etcwhile the next king henry would be king henry ix throughout the uk even though there have been no scottish kings of that name scotland has limited self-government within the united

scottish parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to scotland as well as a limited power to vary income tax198 the scottish parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the uk parliament by passing a legislative consent motion if united kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue the programmes of legislation enacted by the scottish parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the uk for instance university education and care services for the elderly are

constitutional status of scotland is nonetheless subject to ongoing debate the scottish national party snp which supports scottish independence was first elected to form the scottish government in 2007 the new government established a national conversation on constitutional issues proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the scottish parliament federalism or a referendum on scottish independence from the united kingdom in rejecting the last option the three main opposition parties in the scottish parliament created a commission to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved scottish and uk-wide bodies206 the scotland act 2012 based on proposals by the commission was subsequently enacted devolving additional powers to the scottish parliament207 in

notably udal law in orkney and shetland based on old norse law various other systems derived from common celtic or brehon laws survived in the highlands until the 1800s.223 scots law provides for three types of courts responsible for the administration of justice civil criminal and heraldic the supreme civil court is the court of session although civil appeals can be taken to the supreme court of the united kingdom or before 1 october 2009 the house of lords the high court of justiciary is the supreme criminal court in scotland the court of session is housed at parliament house in edinburgh which was the home of the pre-union parliament of scotland with the high court of justiciary and the supreme court of appeal currently located at the lawnmarket the sheriff court is the main criminal and civil court hearing most cases there are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country224 district courts were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims these were gradually replaced by justice of the peace courts from 2008 to 2010 the court of the lord lyon regulates heraldry for many decades the scots legal system was unique for being the only legal system without a parliament this ended with the advent of the scottish parliament which legislates for scotland many features within the system have been preserved within criminal law the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts guilty not guilty and not proven225 both not guilty and not proven result in an acquittal typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy there is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice see the provisions of the double jeopardy scotland act 2011 many laws differ between scotland and the other parts of the united kingdom and many terms differ for certain legal concepts manslaughter in england and wales is broadly similar to culpable homicide in scotland and arson is called wilful fire raising indeed some acts considered crimes in england and wales such as forgery are not so in scotland procedure also differs scots juries sitting in criminal
