proposed since july 2013 a shell gasoline station in hiroshima japan gasoline slin known as petrol ptrl outside north america is a transparent petroleum-derived liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in internal combustion engines it consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum enhanced with a variety of additives on average a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil 159 l yields about 19 us gallons 72l of gasoline when processed in an oil refinery though this varies based on the crude oil sources assay the characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines is measured by its octane rating gasoline is produced in several grades of octane rating tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability control corrosiveness and provide fuel system cleaning and determine performance characteristics under intended use sometimes gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel for economic or environmental reasons gasoline as used worldwide in the vast number of internal combustion engines used in transport and industry has a significant impact on the environment both in local effects eg smog and in global effects eg effect on the climate gasoline may also enter the environment uncombusted as liquid and as vapors from leakage and handling during production transport and delivery from storage tanks from spills etc as an example of efforts to control such leakage many underground storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leakscitation needed gasoline

so-called otto engines were developed in the last quarter of the 19th century in germany the fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas with a boiling point near 85c octanes boil about 40c higher it was well suited for early carburetors evaporators the development of a spray nozzle carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios but early attempts were blocked by knocking premature explosion of fuel in the 1920s antiknock compounds were introduced by thomas midgley jr and boyd specifically tetraethyllead tel this innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline in the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors the 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline these considerations led to the phasing out of tel and its replacement by other antiknock compounds subsequently low-sulfur gasoline was introduced in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems2 etymology and terminologyedit mogas redirects here for other uses see moga disambiguation gasoline is cited under the spelling gasolene from 1863 in the oxford english dictionary it was never a trademark although it may have been derived from older trademarks such as cazeline and gazeline3 variant spellings of gasoline have been used to refer to raw petroleum since the 16th century3 petrol was first used as the name of a refined petroleum product around 1870 by british wholesaler carless capel leonard who marketed it as a solvent4 when the product later found a new use as a motor fuel frederick simms an associate of gottlieb daimler suggested to carless that they register the trade mark petrol5 but by this time the word was already in general use possibly inspired by the french ptrole3 and the registration was not allowed carless registered a number of alternative names for the product while their competitors used the term motor spirit until the 1930s.67 the use of the word gasoline instead of petrol outside north america can often be confusing shortening gasoline to gas which happens often causes confusion with various forms of gas used as car fuel compressed natural gas cng liquefied natural gas lng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg in many countries gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical benzene eg german benzin czech benzn dutch benzine italian benzina polish benzyna chilean spanish bencina thai bayn sin  greek venzini romanian benzin swedish bensin arabic binzn argentina uruguay paraguay and italy use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical naphtha8 octane ratingedit main article octane rating spark ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration however the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time this causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine this is often referred to as engine knocking or end-gas knock knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasolines resistance to autoignition which is expressed by its octane rating octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane an isomer of octane and n-heptane there are different conventions for expressing octane ratings so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used one of the best known is the research octane number ron the octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country in finland sweden and norway 95 ron is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 ron is also available as a more expensive option in the uk ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 ron commonly available premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 ron and super unleaded is usually 97-98 roncitation needed however both shell and bp produce fuel at 102 ron for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 ron in the us octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 859 and 87 aki 91-92 ron for regular through 89-90 aki 94-95 ron for mid-grade equivalent to european regular up to 90-94 aki 95-99 ron for premium european premium south africas largest city johannesburg is located on the highveld at 1,753 metres 5,751ft above sea level so the south african aa recommends 95 octane gasoline petrol at low altitude and 93 octane for use in johannesburg because the higher the altitude the lower the air pressure and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain10 the octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s a higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost and thus higher temperatures and pressures which translate to higher power output some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power in 1943 the rolls-royce merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower 984kw using 100 ron fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement by the time of operation overlord during world war ii both the raf and usaaf were conducting some operations in europe using 150 ron fuel 100150 avgas obtained by adding 2.5 aniline to 100 octane avgas11 by this time the rolls-royce merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel stabilityedit quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up if left undiluted improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring andor the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate if applicable to the vehicle storage should be in an airtight container to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions at a stable cool temperature to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions when gasoline is not stored correctly gums and solids may be created which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces resulting in a condition called stale fuel gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture then forming gums solids or two phases a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase the presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance on resumption of regular engine use the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline the addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits isopropyl alcohol 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene or other additives fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines such as lawnmower and tractor engines especially when their use is seasonal low to no use for one or more seasons of the year users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure to avoid storage at high temperatures to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor2 gasoline stability requirements are set in standard astm d4814-14b the standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines energy contentedit energy is obtained from the combustion of gasoline by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water the combustion of octane follows this

actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75 more or less than the average13 on average about 74 l of gasoline 19.5 us gal 16.3 imp gal are available from a barrel of crude oil about 46 by volume varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline the remainder are products ranging from tar to naphtha14 a high-octane-rated fuel such as liquefied petroleum gas lpg has an overall lower power output at the typical 101 compression ratio of a gasoline engine however with an engine tuned to the use of lpg ie via higher compression ratios such as 121 instead of 101 the power output can be improved this is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking resulting in a higher cylinder temperature which improves efficiency also increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke which is by far the greater effect the higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process an atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages chiefly detonation of a high compression ratio a high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow the lower energy content per liter of lpg in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density energy content per kilogram is higher

of gasoline is derived from a 42-gallon 159 l barrel of crude oil material separated from crude oil via distillation called virgin or straight-run gasoline does not meet specifications for modern engines particularly the octane rating see below but can be pooled to the gasoline blend the bulk of a typical gasoline consists of hydrocarbons with between 4 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule commonly referred to as c4-c122 it is a mixture of paraffins alkanes cycloalkanes naphthenes and olefins alkenes where the usage of the terms paraffin and olefin is particular to the oil industry the actual ratio depends on the oil refinery that makes the gasoline as not all refineries have the same set of processing units the crude oil feed used by the refinery the grade of gasoline in particular the octane rating the various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics some important streams are straight-run gasoline usually also called naphtha is distilled directly from crude oil once the leading source of fuel its low octane rating required lead additives it is low in aromatics depending on the grade of crude oil containing some cycloalkanes naphthenes and no olefins alkenes between 0 and 20 of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline because the supply of this fraction is insufficientclarification needed and its ron is too lowcitation needed the chemical properties namely octane and rvp of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerisation however before feeding those units the naphtha needs to be split in light and heavy naphtha straight-run gasoline can be also used as a feedstock into steam-crackers to produce olefins reformate produced in a catalytic reformer has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefins alkenes most of the benzene toluene and xylene the so-called btx are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent catalytic cracked gasoline or catalytic cracked naphtha produced from a catalytic cracker with a moderate octane rating high olefins alkene content and moderate aromatics level hydrocrackate heavy mid and light produced from a hydrocracker with medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels alkylate is produced in an alkylation unit using as feedstocks isobutane and alkenes alkylate contains no aromatics and alkenes and has high mon isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low octane straight run gasoline to iso-paraffins non-chain alkanes like isooctane isomerate has medium ron and mon but nil aromatics and olefins butane is usually blended in the gasoline pool although the quantity of this stream is limited by the rvp specification the terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies currently many countries set limits on gasoline aromatics in general benzene in particular and olefin alkene content such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin alkane components such as alkylate and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content in the eu the benzene limit is set at 1 volume for all grade of automotive gasoline gasoline can also contain other organic compounds such as organic ethers deliberately added plus small levels of contaminants in particular organosulfur compounds but these are usually removed at the refinery additivesedit see also list of gasoline additives antiknock additivesedit a plastic container for storing gasoline used in germany almost all countries in the world have phased out automotive leaded fuel in 2011 six countries16 were still using leaded gasoline afghanistan myanmar north korea algeria iraq and yemen it was expected that by the end of 2013 those countries would ban leaded gasoline17 but it has not occurred algeria will replace leaded with unleaded automotive fuel only in 2015.clarification needed different additives have replaced the lead compounds the most popular additives include aromatic hydrocarbons ethers and alcohol usually ethanol or methanol for technical reasons the use of leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100ll because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach without the use of leaded additives a gas can tetraethylleadedit main article tetraethyllead gasoline when used in high-compression internal combustion engines tends to autoignite detonate causing damaging engine knocking also called pinging or pinking noise to address this problem tetraethyllead tel was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the 1920s with the discovery of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by the lead however and the incompatibility of lead with catalytic converters leaded gasoline was phased out in the usa beginning in 1973 by 1995 leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6 of total gasoline sales and under 2000 short tons 1814 t of lead per year in the usa from 1 january 1996 the us clean air act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the usa the use of tel also necessitated other additives such as dibromoethane first european countries started replacing lead by the end of the 1980s and by the end of the 1990s leaded gasoline was banned within the entire european union reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the united states18 and south africa19 a statistically significant

under the protocol for the evaluation of effects of metallic fuel-additives on the emissions performance of vehicles25 fuel stabilizers antioxidants and metal deactivatorsedit substituted phenols and derivatives of phenylenediamine are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline gasoline gummy sticky resin deposits result from oxidative degradation of gasoline upon long term storage these harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline see drying oils improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems previously catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines are most susceptible to oxidation the formation of these gums is accelerated by copper salts which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators this degradation can be prevented through the addition of 5100 ppm of antioxidants such as phenylenediamines and other amines2 hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil-soluble strong amine bases such as hindered phenols stale gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline26 gasolines are also treated with metal deactivators which are compounds that sequester deactivate metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues the metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel detergentsedit gasoline as delivered at the

federal renewable fuel standard rfs effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable biofuels mostly ethanol with gasoline sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10 most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10 ethanol an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage until late 2010 fuels retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol e10 and most vehicle warranties except for flexible fuel vehicles authorize fuels that contain no more than 10

united states aviation gasoline avgas is dyed to identify its octane rating and to distinguish it from kerosene-based jet fuel which is clear33 in canada the gasoline for marine and farm use is dyed red and is not subject to road taxcitation needed oxygenate blendingedit oxygenate blending adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as mtbe etbe ethanol and biobutanol the presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas in many areas throughout the us oxygenate blending is mandated by epa regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants for example in southern california fuel must contain 2 oxygen by weight resulting in a mixture of 5.6 ethanol in gasoline the resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline rfg or oxygenated gasoline or in the case of california california reformulated gasoline the federal requirement that rfg contain oxygen was dropped on 6 may 2006 because the industry had developed voc-controlled rfg that did not need additional oxygen34 mtbe was phased out in the us due to ground water contamination and the resulting regulations and lawsuits ethanol and to a lesser extent the ethanol-derived etbe are common replacements a common ethanol-gasoline mix of 10 ethanol mixed with gasoline is called gasohol or e10 and an ethanol-gasoline mix of 85 ethanol mixed with gasoline is called e85 the most extensive use of ethanol takes place in brazil where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane in 2004 over 3.4 billion us gallons 2.8billion impgal13 million m of ethanol was produced in the united states for fuel use mostly from corn and e85 is slowly becoming available in much of the united states though many of the relatively few stations vending e85 are not open to the general public35 the use of bioethanol either directly or indirectly by conversion of such ethanol to bio-etbe is encouraged by the european union directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport since producing bioethanol from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation though ordinary people in much of europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own

of 1 us gallon 3.8l of gasoline produces 8.74 kilograms 19.3lb of carbon dioxide 2.3kgl a greenhouse gas36 the main concern with gasoline on the environment aside from the complications of its extraction and refining is the potential effect on the climate unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank when in the atmosphere reacts in sunlight to produce photochemical smog vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline but the increase is greatest at 10 by volumecitation needed at higher concentrations of ethanol above 10 the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease at a 10 ethanol by volume the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog this rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture the chief risks of such leaks come not from vehicles but from gasoline delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks because of this risk most underground storage tanks now have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent any such leaks such as monitoring systems veeder-root franklin fueling production of gasoline

opal fuel has been developed by the bp kwinana oil refinery in australia and contains only 5 aromatics which weakens the effects of inhalation42 flammabilityedit uncontrolled burning of gasoline produces large quantities of soot and carbon monoxide like other hydrocarbons gasoline burns in a limited range of its vapor phase and coupled with its volatility this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4 by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6 if the concentration is below 1.4 the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite if the concentration is above 7.6 the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite however gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air making unconstrained gasoline quickly
