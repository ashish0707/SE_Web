territory regardless of the publication language the ranges of isbns assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active some isbn registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services in other cases the isbn registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded in canada isbns are issued at no cost with the stated purpose of encouraging canadian culture13 in the united kingdom united states and some other countries where the service is provided by non-government-funded organisations the issuing of isbns requires payment of a fee australia isbns are issued by the commercial library services agency thorpe-bowker14 and prices range from 42 for a

accompanying series of isbns within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the isbns to each of its books in most countries a book publisher is not required by law to assign an isbn however most book stores only handle isbn bearing merchandisecitation needed a listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published and can be ordered in book form 1399 us1959 the web site of the isbn agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes28 partial lists have been compiled from library catalogs for the english-language groups identifier 0 and identifier 1 publishers receive blocks of isbns with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive isbns of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element once that block of isbns is used the publisher may receive another block of isbns with a different registrant element consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements there also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country this might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers by using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of isbns that they make to publishers for example a large publisher may be given a block of isbns where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements29 here are some

digitsedit a check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit it consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number the method for the ten digit code is an extension of that for sbns the two systems are compatible and sbn prefixed with 0 will give the same check-digit as without - the digit is base eleven and can be 0-9 or x the system for thirteen digit codes is not compatible and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding 10 digit isbn and does not provide the same protection against transposition this is because the thirteen digit code was required to be compatible with the ean format and hence could not contain an x isbn-10 check digitsedit the 2001 edition of the official manual of the international isbn agency says that the isbn-10 check digit31 which is the last digit of the ten-digit isbn must range from 0 to 10 the symbol x is used for 10 and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from 10 to 1 is a multiple of 11 for example for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615-2 s 0 10 3 9 0 8 6 7 4 6 0 5 6 4 1 3 5 2 2 1 0 27

sum of all the ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10 is a multiple of 11 for this example s 0 1 3 2 0 3 6 4 4 5 0 6 6 7 1 8 5 9 2 10 0 6 0 24 20 0 42 8 45 20 165 15

digit or the transposition of adjacent digits it can be proved that all possible valid isbn-10s have at least two digits different from each other it can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid isbn-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits these are true only because the isbn is less than 11 digits long and because 11 is a prime number the isbn check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error ie if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid isbn the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11 however if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected the book will be issued with an invalid isbn32 in contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non-transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid isbn number although it is still unlikely isbn-10 check digit calculationedit modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11 each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit isbnexcluding the check digit itselfis multiplied by a number in a sequence from 10 to 2 and the remainder of the sum with respect to 11 is computed the resulting remainder plus the check digit must equal a multiple of 11 either 0 or 11 therefore the check digit is 11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11 modulo 11 taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0 without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 0 11 which is invalid strictly speaking the first modulo 11 is unneeded but it may be considered to simplify the calculation for example the check digit for an isbn-10 of 0-306-40615- is calculated as follows s 11 0 10 3 9 0 8 6 7 4 6 0 5 6 4 1 3 5 2 mod 11 mod 11 11 0 27 0 42 24 0 24 3 10 mod 11 mod 11 11 130 mod 11 mod 11 11 9 mod 11

possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples returns isbn error syndrome zero for a valid

end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as 496 for the invalid isbn 99999-999-9-x or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition isbn-13 check digit calculationedit the 2005 edition of the international isbn agencys official manual33 describes how the 13-digit isbn check digit is calculated the isbn-13 check digit which is the last digit of the isbn must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between 1 and 3 is a multiple of 10 formally using modular arithmetic we can say x 1 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 5 3 x 6 x 7 3 x 8 x 9 3 x 10 x 11 3 x 12 x 13 0 mod 10  displaystyle x_13x_2x_33x_4x_53x_6x_73x_8x_93x_10x_113x_12x_13equiv 0pmod 10 the calculation of an isbn-13 check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit isbn thus excluding the check digit itself each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3 then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9 subtracted from 10 that leaves a result from 1 to 10 a zero 0 replaces a ten 10 so in all cases a single check digit results for example the isbn-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- is calculated as follows s 91 73 81 03 31 03 61 43 01 63 11 53 9 21 8 0 3 0 6 12 0 18 1 15 93 93 10 9 remainder 3 10 3 7 thus the check digit is 7 and the complete sequence is isbn 978-0-306-40615-7 in general the isbn-13 check digit is calculated as follows let r 10 x 1 3 x 2 x 3 3 x 4 x 11 3 x 12 mod 10  displaystyle rbig 10-big x_13x_2x_33x_4cdots x_113x_12big bmod 10big  then x 13 r r 10 0 r 10 displaystyle x_13begincasesrtext r100text r10endcases this check system similar to the upc check digit formula does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5 the check digit will not catch their transposition for instance the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1 the correct order contributes 3611 19 to the sum while if the digits are transposed 1 followed by a 6 the contribution of those two digits will be 3116 9 however 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10 and so produce the same final result both isbns will have a check digit of 7 the isbn-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit additionally if the sum of the 2nd 4th 6th 8th 10th and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th and 13th the total will always be divisible by 10 ie end in 0 isbn-10 to isbn-13 conversionedit the conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix 978 to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the isbn-13 algorithm errors in usageedit publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the isbn check digit publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its isbn before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers34 for example isbn 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books ninja gaiden a novel based on the best-selling game by tecmo 1990 and wacky laws 1997 both published by scholastic most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid isbn issued by the publisher the library of congress catalogue contains books published with invalid isbns which it usually tags with the phrase cancelled isbn35 however book-ordering systems such as amazoncom will not search for a book if an invalid isbn is entered to its search enginecitation needed oclc often indexes by invalid isbns if the book is indexed in that way by a member library eisbnedit only the term isbn should be used the terms eisbn and e-isbn have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided if a book exists in one or more digital e-book formats each of those formats must have its own isbn in other words each of the three separate epub amazon kindle and pdf formats of a particular book will have its own specific isbn they should not share the isbn of the paper version and there is no generic eisbn which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title36 ean format used in barcodes and upgradingedit currently the barcodes on a books back cover or inside a mass-market paperback books front cover are ean-13 they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits for the currency and the recommended retail price37 for 10 digit isbns the number 978 the bookland country code is prefixed to the isbn in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the ean13 formula modulo 10 1x and 3x weighting on alternate digits partly because of an expected shortage in certain isbn categories the international organization for standardization iso decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit isbn isbn-13 the process began 1 january 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 january 2007.38 as of 2011 all the 13-digit isbns began with 978 as the 978 isbn supply is exhausted the 979 prefix was introduced part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the musicland code for musical scores with an ismn 10 digit ismn codes differed visually as they began with an m letter the bar code represents the m as a zero 0 and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3 all ismns are now 13 digits commencing 979-0 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by isbn publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 isbns likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same moreover the ten-digit isbn check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit isbn check digit because the gtin-13 is part of the global trade item number gtin system that includes the gtin-14 the gtin-12 and the gtin-8 the 13-digit isbn falls within the 14-digit data field range39 barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the isbn-13 barcode format is identical to the ean barcode format of existing 10-digit isbns so migration to an ean-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing isbn based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems hence many booksellers eg barnes noble migrated to ean barcodes as early as march 2005 although many american and canadian booksellers were able to read ean-13 barcodes before 2005 most general retailers could not read them the upgrading of the upc barcode system to full ean-13 in 2005 eased migration to the isbn-13 in north america see alsoedit asin amazon standard identification number coden serial publication identifier currently used by libraries replaced
