federation to have introduced a formal system of horizontal fiscal equalisation hfe which was introduced in 1933 to compensate states which have a lower capacity to raise revenue many federations use fiscal equalisation to reduce the inequalities in the fiscal capacities of sub-national governments arising from the differences in their geography demography natural endowments and economies however the level of equalisation sought varies in australia the objective is full equalisation full equalisation means that after hfe each of the six states the australian capital territory and the northern territory would have the capacity to provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard if each state or territory made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency currently the funds distributed to achieve hfe are the revenues raised from the goods and services tax gst currently about aud50bn a year the distribution of gst required to achieve hfe is decided by the federal treasurer each year on the basis of advice provided by the commonwealth grants commission cgc achieving hfe does not mean that the states and territories are directed how to raise revenue or how to spend their funds gst revenue grants from the commonwealth are unencumbered and available for any purpose accordingly hfe equalises fiscal capacity not fiscal policies which remain for the states and territories to decide for themselves it does not result in the same level of services or taxes in all states and territories direct that the states and territories must achieve any specified level of service in any area nor impose actual budget outcomes in accordance with the commissions calculations2 at its meeting on 13 december 2013
