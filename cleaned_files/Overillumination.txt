this cosmetics store has over twice the recommended lighting levels 1 over-illumination is the presence of lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate for a specific activity over-illumination was commonly ignored between 1950 and 1995 especially in office and retail environments2 since then however the interior design community has begun to reconsider this practice over-illumination encompasses two separate concerns unnecessary electric lighting is expensive and energy-intensive lighting accounts for approximately 9 of residential electricity use as of 2001update3 and about 40 of commercial electricity use4 excessive levels of artificial light may adversely affect health these detrimental effects may depend on the spectrum as well as the overall brightness level of light over-illumination can be reduced by installing occupancy sensors using natural sunlight whenever possible turning off lights when leaving a room or changing the type of lightbulb over-illumination does not refer to snowblindness where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye too little light the opposite of over-illumination is associated

illuminated mostly by natural light over-illumination can be caused by several factors illuminating an unoccupied area using electrical lights instead of natural light providing lighting for an occupied area but with too much intensity installing too few electrical controls this results in an area that must either be over-illuminated or not illuminated at all in addition there are ancillary reasons why over-illumination might be decided to be necessary for example retail stores with large windows will sometimes stay illuminated overnight as a method of crime prevention while some aspects of illumination are readily controllable such as turning off lights when exiting a room others are determined by the architecture and construction of the building for example skylights decrease the amount of artificial lighting that is required during the daytime but most buildings do not have them installed in addition too few light switches can also cause issues if an office building with large windows only has one switch per floor then electric lights will illuminate the perimeter areas with abundant natural light to same level as the interior zones which receive less sunlight health

effects while some effects might happen because the color spectrum of fluorescent lighting is significantly different from sunlight567full citation neededneed quotation to verify other symptoms might be caused by light that is simply too intense in particular over-illumination has been linked to headaches fatigue medically defined stress anxiety and decreases in sexual function58910 some studies attribute migraine headaches to overly intense light8 while others linked it with certain spectral distributions7 in one survey bright light was the number two trigger affecting 47 of respondents for causing a migraine episode8 fatigue is another common complaint from individuals exposed to over-illumination especially with fluorescent media5 likewise over-illumination can also cause stress and anxiety in fact natural light was preferred over purely artificial light by office workers from both eastern and western cultures11 in addition over-illumination can cause medical stress912 and even aggravate other psychological disorders like agoraphobia13 the replacement of natural light with artificial light also decreases task performance under certain conditions10 circulatory and circadian rhythm effectsedit hypertension effects of over-illumination can lead to aggravation of cardiovascular disease and erectile dysfunction which impacts are outcomes of long term cumulative exposure and associated systematic increases in blood pressure the mechanism of this effect seems to be stress by related upregulation of adrenaline production akin to the fight-or-flight response1415 circadian rhythm disruption is primarily caused by the wrong timing of light in reference to the circadian phase it can also be affected by too much light too little light or incorrect spectral composition of light this effect is driven by stimulus or lack of stimulus to photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina the time of day the circadian phase is signalled to the pineal gland the bodys photometer by the suprachiasmatic nucleus bright light in the evening or in the early morning shifts the phase of the production of melatonin see phase response curve an out-of-sync melatonin rhythm can worsen cardiac arrhythmias and increase oxidized lipids in the ischemic heart melatonin also reduces superoxide production and myeloperoxide an enzyme in neutrophils which produces hypochlorous acid during ischemia-reperfusion716 energy and economic considerationsedit using too much lighting will lead to higher electricity consumption and therefore higher electricity costs for the owner of the building the solution to this issue is multi-faceted because there are several causes of too much light high-intensity lightedit first over-illumination happens when the intensity of lighting is too high for a given activity for example an office building might have many sets of fluorescent lights to keep the area illuminated after sundown during the daytime however large windows might allow for abundant amounts of natural sunlight to enter the office therefore keeping all of the fluorescent lights illuminated during the daytime might cause unnecessary costs and energy consumption leaving lights turned onedit likewise not switching off the lights when exiting a room will also cause higher energy consumption some people avoid frequently turning off cfl bulbs because they think that doing so will cause them to burn out prematurely while this is true to a certain extent17 the us department of energy recommends that 15 minutes is an appropriate time frame if someone plans to leave the room for less than 15 minutes then the light should be left on if the room will be unoccupied for more than 15 minutes then the light should be switched off18 another concern is that turning on a fluorescent bulb consumes large amounts of energy while fluorescent bulbs do need more energy turn on the amount of electricity consumed is equal to only a few seconds of normal operation181920 sometimes people do not turn off lights for other reasons such as an office worker whose company actually pays for the electricity in these cases building automation provides more control these solutions provide centralized control of all lighting within a home or commercial building allowing easy implementation of scheduling occupancy control daylight harvesting and more many systems also support demand response and will automatically dim or turn off lights to take advantage of dr incentives and cost savings many newer control systems are using wireless mesh open standards such as zigbee which provides benefits including easier installation no need to run control wires and interoperability with other standards-based building control systems eg security21 architectural design and the type of light bulbsedit architectural design can also provide ways of reducing energy usage there are technological aspects of window design where window angles can be calculated to minimize interior glare and reduce interior over-illumination while at the same time reducing solar heat loading and subsequent demand for air conditioning as energy conservation techniques for the dakin building in brisbane california the angled window projections effectively provide permanent sunscreens obviating interior blinds or shades ideally the design of a building would create multiple switches for the overhead lighting adjusting these settings would allow the optimal light intensity to be delivered2 the most common version of this control being the three-level switch also called ab switching much of the benefit of the excess illumination reduction comes from a better ratio of natural light to fluorescent light that can result from any of the above changes research has been conducted showing worker productivity gains in settings where each worker selects his or her own lighting level22 lastly the type of light bulbs that are installed has a significant effect on energy consumption the efficiency of light sources vary greatly fluorescent lights produce several times as much light for given power input as incandescent lights do and leds are continuing to improve beyond that shades vary in their absorption light colored ceilings walls and other surfaces increase ambient light by reflecting related phenomenaedit over-illumination can also contribute to light pollution if stray light can be seen a neighboring property or building over-illumination is a topic normally addressed in the process of building design whereas light pollution is normally addressed
