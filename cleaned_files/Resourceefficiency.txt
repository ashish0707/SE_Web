resource efficiency is about maximising the supply of money materials staff and other assets that can be drawn on by a person or organization in order to function effectively with minimum wasted natural resource expenses it means using the earths limited resources in a sustainable manner while minimising environmental impact contents 1 motivation 2 related concepts 3 energy efficiency 4

40 gap between available water supplies and water needs by 2030 and some critical materials could be in short supply as soon as 2016 these challenges could lead to disruptions to supply growing regulatory requirements volatile fluctuation of prices and may ultimately threaten the viability of existing business models1 related conceptsedit resource efficiency measures methods and aims are quite similar to those of resource productivityresource intensity and of the slightly more environment-inclined concept of ecological efficiencyeco-efficiency see also sustainability measurement energy efficiencyedit main article efficient energy use possible approachesedit to achieve and optimize natural resource and energy effiency several sustainable economical or production schemes have been proposed over the course of the last 50 years circular economy cradle-to-cradle- or regenerative design as well as biomimetics principles just to name a few common to all of them is built-in sustainability in which non-renewable resource-wasting is ruled out by design they are generally built to be holistic robustly self-sustaining and respecting the carrying capacity of the economic ecological system resource use measurement and identification of hotspotsedit a key tool in resource efficiency is measuring different aspects of resource use eg carbon footprint water footprint land footprint or material use then identifying hot spots where the most resources are used andor where there are the best opportunities to reduce this resource use for example wrap has published information on hotspots for 50 grocery products likely to contribute most to the environmental impacts associated with uk household consumption 2 wrap have created a range of tools and guides to help improve business resource efficiency3 initiatives and programmesedit unepedit unep works to promote resource efficiency and sustainable consumption and production scp in both developed and developing countries the focus is on achieving increased understanding and implementation by public and private decision makers as well as civil society of policies and actions for resource efficiency and scp this includes the promotion of sustainable resource management in a life cycle perspective for goods and services4 europe 2020edit the resource-efficient europe flagship initiative is part of the europe 2020 strategy the eus growth strategy for a smart inclusive and sustainable economy it supports the shift towards sustainable growth via a resource-efficient low-carbon economy5 resource efficiency in tomsk polytechnic universityedit in october 2012 tomsk polytechnic university tpu launched the development program of resource efficient technologies for the period 2013-2018.6 that program was presented by tpu in 2009 at the russian federal competition national research university a key point of the program of tpu was announced the formation of high school as a world-class university-based staffing and development of technologies for resource-efficient economy tpu developed educational module resource efficiency prepared and published a textbook principals of resource efficiency optional subject matter of the same name introduced in the curriculum for all disciplines and areas of undergraduate tpu envisages university development in the field of resource-efficient technologies that unites six research and educational clusters safe environment non-destructive testing and diagnostics materials for extreme conditions domestic and industrial waste recycling
