franks19 modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm20 the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english21 it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation22 another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca23 however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around24 history

same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc29 the maison carre was a temple of the gallo-roman city of nemausus present-day nmes and is one of the best preserved vestiges of the roman empire the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia around 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french30 julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc31 gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces32 many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the capital of the gauls32 these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians33 nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul34 in 312 the emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire35 but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed36

ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory known as the kingdom of syagrius simultaneously celtic britons fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region with clovis conversion to catholicism in 498 the frankish monarchy elective and secular until then became hereditary and of divine right the pagan franks from whom the ancient name of francie was derived originally settled the north part of gaul but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church french la fille ane de lglise by the papacy38 and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france rex christianissimus the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian

viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobilitys titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the kings vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for

of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu reinforced the centralisation of the state royal power and french dominance in europe foreshadowing the reign of louis xiv during louis xivs minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france which was at that

to varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility european monarchies gathered against the new rgime to restore the french absolute monarchy the foreign threat exacerbated frances political

oceanic climate zone cfb cwb and cfc in the kppen classification a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances the west of france has strictly oceanic climate it extends from flanders to the basque country in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide narrower to the north and south but wider in brittany which is almost entirely in this climate zone the climate of the south is also oceanic but warmer the climate of the northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier away from the coast the climate is always oceanic but it characteristics change a little in the paris sedimentary basin and more in the intra mountain basins the seasonal amplitude becomes a little stronger the autumn rains and winter especially are less marked therefore most of the territory has qualified climate gradient semi-oceanic climate this is a transition zone between the strict oceanic climate and continental climate the oceanic degraded climate of plain in the centrenorth sometimes called parisien due tot eh fact that corresponds approximately to the paris basin where the oceanic climate is slightly altered and the semi-continental climate in the north and in the centre-west alsace plains of sane or of middle-rhne

europe france was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971.80 although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions behind less populous nations such as canada or australia this is due to frances decision to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis81 which now accounts for 75 of its

france and constitution of france the french republic is a unitary semi-presidential republic with strong democratic traditions108 the constitution of the fifth republic was approved by referendum on 28 september 1958.109 it greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to parliament the executive branch itself has two leaders the president of the republic currently franois hollande who is head of state and is elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term formerly 7 years110 and the government led by the president-appointed prime minister currently manuel valls the french parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a national assembly assemble nationale and a senate111 the national assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms112 the assembly has the power to dismiss the government and thus the majority in the assembly determines the choice of government senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms originally 9-year terms and one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years starting in september 2008.113 the senates legislative powers are limited in the event of disagreement between the two chambers the national assembly has the final say114 the government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of parliament french politics are characterised by two politically opposed groupings one left-wing centred on the french socialist party and the other right-wing centred previously around the rassemblement pour la rpublique rpr then its successor the ump union for a popular movement ump which in 2015 was renamed les rpublicains115 since the 2012 elections the executive branch is currently composed mostly of the socialist party law main article law of france france uses a civil legal system78 that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy the basic principles that the french republic must respect are found in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen french law is divided into two principal areas private law and public law private law includes in particular civil law and criminal law public law includes in particular administrative law and constitutional law however in practical terms french law comprises three principal areas of law civil law criminal law and administrative law criminal laws can only address the future and not the past criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited116 while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court ordinary courts which handle criminal and civil litigation are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state to be applicable every law must be officially published in the journal officiel de la rpublique franaise france does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions france has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws the latter being abolished in 1791 however offences against public decency contraires aux bonnes murs or disturbing public order trouble lordre public have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution since 1999 civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted and since may 2013 same-sex marriage and lgbt adoption are legal in france117 laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881 some consider however that hate speech laws in france are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech118 france has laws against racism and antisemitism119 since 1990 the gayssot act prohibits holocaust denial frances attitude towards freedom of religion is complex freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen however since the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state the state tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the french society the parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004 in 2010 it banned the wearing of face-covering islamic veils in public as some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus and after criticism by human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch120121 these laws remain controversial although they are supported by most of the population122 foreign relations main article foreign relations of france french president franois mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl in 1987 france is a founding member of the
