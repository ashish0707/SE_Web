after germany electricity from renewable sources in spain represented 42.8 of electricity demand coverage during 2014 the country has a very large wind power capability built up over many years and is one of the world leaders in wind power generation initially spain also positioned itself as a european leader in solar power by 2007-2010 the country was second only to germany in installed capacity however other countries italy in particular have since leapfrogged spanish development by 2015 solar power in spain though significant produced less than a third of that of wind power in 2015 spain has set the target of generating 20 of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 20203 and an additional 0.8 may be available for other eu countries under the cooperation mechanism bringing the total to 20.8.4 by the end of 2014 spain had reached a level of 16.2 of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources5 the story of renewable energy development in spain is both a mixed and unfinished one under previous subsidies the country expanded its renewable base rapidly and helped establish a domestic industry in both wind turbine and solar energy however support was drastically cut back following the global financial crisis and new installations stagnated between 2012 and 2015 the debts incurred during the boom period have led to tougher and retrospective revisions of contracts to providers of renewable energy reducing returns considerably in being one of the first-to-market countries spain faces the challenge of powerful competitors from countries such as denmark germany and china and ironically a cheaper and more mature renewable energy sector which spain itself helped to pioneer in 2015 solar power suddenly demonstrated a possible way through the impasse the continued fall in prices for solar systems and spains abundant sunshine led to prices for solar power reaching grid price parity suddenly there was the potential for sustained and spontaneous growth in solar installations in spain as households and producers could produce power more economically however the spanish government introduced what has been dubbed the worlds first sun tax on solar installations making them economically less viable as well as draconian fines up to 60 million euros for anyone not complying with the tax the tax has proved highly controversial on the one hand the government has argued that those generating their own power still rely on the national grid for power backup and so should be liable for contributing to the cost on the other hand the solar industry has argued that the government is simply trying to protect the centralised established power producers whose revenues would be threatened by this competiitve solar threat environmentalists have criticised the tax for artificially blocking spain from continuing its long standing movement to renewable energy production whatever the merits of both arguments the controversy can only become more heightened as the price of solar energy continues to fall and if pv solar power installed capacity in spain were to continue sliding down the eu league from 12th position in 2014 102.9 kw per 1000 inhabitants in the same year in terms of wind energy production spain was much stronger in 3rd position 495 kw per 1000 inhabitants contents 1 energy consumption by

the heating and cooling sector also known as the thermal sector includes domestic heating and air conditioning industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally the electricity sector and transport sector are also projected to account for around a third of energy consumption each at 33.6 and 33.9 respectively the proportion of energy use in each sector is similar to that of 2016 in order to meet spains overall target for 20 use of renewable energy it was just 8.3 in 2005 in gross final energy consumption 20,505 ktoe by 2020 targets have been set for each sector as

million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2020 the report expected spain to produce a surplus of 0.8 above the 20 target 20.8 total for renewable energy use which would be available for other countries to meet their renewable energy targets under the cooperation mechanism the energy measures above are gross final energy consumption another broader measure primary energy consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels the energy sector and energy lost in transformation the transformation sector ie converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants as well as gross final energy consumption for end users under the european union energy efficiency directive eu countries submit their energy efficiency plans every three years and energy efficiency annual reports every year according to spains 2016 energy efficiency annual report the countrys total final energy consumption in 2014 was 79.2 mtoes whilst its primary energy consumption was 112.6 mtoes8 most of the approximately 42 difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector these losses are likely to be most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce co2 emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption by using more efficient thermal generation the potential remains to reduce energy wastage by almost a third and to cut co2 emissions accordingly electricity sectoredit renewable electricity by sourceedit components of renewable electricity coverage in spain
