proton-conducting fuel cell a fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction of positively charged hydrogen ions with oxygen or another oxidizing agent1 fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen or air to sustain the chemical reaction whereas in a battery the chemicals present in the battery react with each other to generate an electromotive force emf fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as these inputs are supplied the first fuel cells were invented in 1838 the first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in nasa space programs to generate power for satellites and space capsules since then fuel cells have been used in many other applications fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas they are also used to power fuel cell vehicles including forklifts automobiles buses boats motorcycles and submarines there are many types of fuel cells but they all consist of an anode a cathode and an electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions or protons to move between the two sides of the fuel cell the anode and cathode contain catalysts that cause the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons the hydrogen ions are drawn through the electrolyte after the reaction at the same time electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit producing direct current electricity at the cathode hydrogen ions electrons and oxygen react to form water as the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells pem fuel cells or pemfc to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells sofc individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials about 0.7 volts so cells are stacked or placed in series to create sufficient voltage to meet an applications requirements2 in addition to electricity fuel cells produce water heat and depending on the fuel source very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions the energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 4060 or up to 85 efficient in cogeneration if waste heat is captured for use the fuel cell market is growing and in 2013 pike research estimated that the stationary fuel cell

hydrogen fuel cells appeared in 1838 in a letter dated october 1838 but published in the december 1838 edition of the london and edinburgh philosophical magazine and journal of science welsh physicist and barrister william grove wrote about the development of his first crude fuel cells he used a combination of sheet iron copper and porcelain plates and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid45 in a letter to the same publication written in december 1838 but published in june 1839 german physicist christian friedrich schnbein discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented his letter discussed current generated from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water6 grove later sketched his design in 1842 in the same journal the fuel cell he made used similar materials to todays phosphoric-acid fuel cell7 9.8 in 1939 british engineer francis thomas bacon successfully developed a 5kw stationary fuel cell in 1955 w thomas grubb a chemist working for the general electric company ge further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte three years later another ge chemist leonard niedrach devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions this became known as the grubb-niedrach fuel cell910 ge went on to develop this technology with nasa and mcdonnell aircraft leading to its use during project gemini this was the first commercial use of a fuel cell in 1959 a team led by harry ihrig built a 15kw fuel cell tractor for allis-chalmers which was demonstrated across the us at state fairs this system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants later in 1959 bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine in the 1960s pratt and whitney licensed bacons us patents for use in the us space program to supply electricity and drinking water hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks in 1991 the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by roger billings1112 utc power was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large stationary fuel cell system for use as a co-generation power plant in hospitals universities and large office buildings13 in recognition of the fuel cell industry and americas role in fuel cell development the us senate recognized october 8 2015 as national hydrogen and fuel cell day passing s res 217 the date was chosen in recognition of the atomic weight of hydrogen 1.008.14 types of fuel cells designedit fuel cells come in many varieties however they all work in the same general manner they are made up of three adjacent segments the anode the electrolyte and the cathode two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments the net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed water or carbon dioxide is created and an electric current is created which can be used to power electrical devices normally referred to as the load at the anode a catalyst oxidizes the fuel usually hydrogen turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron the electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it but the electrons cannot the freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current the ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode once reaching the cathode the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical usually oxygen to create water or carbon dioxide a block diagram of a fuel cell the most important design features in a fuel cell arecitation needed the electrolyte substance the electrolyte substance usually defines the type of fuel cell the fuel that is used the most common fuel is hydrogen the anode catalyst breaks down the fuel into electrons and ions the anode catalyst is usually made up of very fine platinum powder the cathode catalyst turns the ions into the waste chemicals like water or carbon dioxide the cathode catalyst is often made up of nickel but it can also be a nanomaterial-based catalyst a typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 v to 0.7 v at full rated load voltage decreases as current increases due to several factors activation loss ohmic loss voltage drop due to resistance of the cell components and interconnections mass transport loss depletion of reactants at catalyst sites under high loads causing rapid loss of voltage15 to deliver the desired amount of energy the fuel cells can be combined in series to yield higher voltage and in parallel to allow a higher current to be supplied such a design is called a fuel cell stack the cell surface area can also be increased to allow higher current from each cell within the stack reactant gases must be distributed uniformly over each of the cells to maximize the power output161718 proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcsedit main article proton exchange membrane fuel cell in the archetypical hydrogenoxide proton exchange membrane fuel cell design a proton-conducting polymer membrane typically nafion contains the electrolyte solution that separates the anode and cathode sides1920 this was called a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell spefc in the early 1970s before the proton exchange mechanism was well-understood notice that the synonyms polymer electrolyte membrane and proton exchange mechanism result in the same acronym on the anode side hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons these protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what are commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes the protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit supplying power because the membrane is electrically insulating on the cathode catalyst oxygen molecules react with the electrons which have traveled through the external circuit and protons to form water in addition to this pure hydrogen type there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells including diesel methanol see direct-methanol fuel cells and indirect methanol fuel cells and chemical hydrides the waste products with these types of fuel are carbon dioxide and water when hydrogen is used the co2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam in a process called steam methane reforming to produce the hydrogen this can take place in a different location to the fuel cell potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoorsfor example in fork lifts construction of a high-temperature pemfc bipolar plate as electrode with in-milled gas channel structure fabricated from conductive composites enhanced with graphite carbon black carbon fiber andor carbon nanotubes for more conductivity21 porous carbon papers reactive layer usually on the polymer membrane applied polymer membrane condensation of water produced by a pemfc on the air channel wall the gold wire around the cell ensures the collection of electric current22 the different components of a pemfc are bipolar plates electrodes catalyst membrane and the necessary hardware such as current collectors and gaskets23 the materials used for different parts of the fuel cells differ by type the bipolar plates may be made of different types of materials such as metal coated metal graphite flexible graphite cc composite carbonpolymer composites etc24 the membrane electrode assembly mea is referred as the heart of the pemfc and is usually made of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two catalyst-coated carbon papers platinum andor similar type of noble metals are usually used as the catalyst for pemfc the electrolyte could be a polymer membrane proton exchange membrane fuel cell design issuesedit cost in 2013 the department of energy estimated that 80-kw automotive fuel cell system costs of us67 per kilowatt could be achieved assuming volume production of 100,000 automotive units per year and us55 per kilowatt could be achieved assuming volume production of 500,000 units per year25 many companies are working on techniques to reduce cost in a variety of ways including reducing the amount of platinum needed in each individual cell ballard power systems has experimented with a catalyst enhanced with carbon silk which allows a 30 reduction 1mgcm to 0.7mgcm in platinum usage without reduction in performance26 monash university melbourne uses pedot as a cathode27 a 2011 published study doi 10.1021ja111290428 documented the first metal-free electrocatalyst using relatively inexpensive doped carbon nanotubes which are less than 1 the cost of platinum and are of equal or superior performance a recently published article demonstrated how the environmental burdens change when using carbon nanotubes as carbon substrate for platinum29 water and air management30 in pemfcs in this type of fuel cell the membrane must be hydrated requiring water to be evaporated at precisely the same rate that it is produced if water is evaporated too quickly the membrane dries resistance across it increases and eventually it will crack creating a gas short circuit where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly generating heat that will damage the fuel cell if the water is evaporated too slowly the electrodes will flood preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction methods to manage water in cells are being developed like electroosmotic pumps focusing on flow control just as in a combustion engine a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently temperature management the same temperature must be maintained throughout the cell in order to prevent destruction of the cell through thermal loading this is particularly challenging as the 2h2 o2 - 2h2o reaction is highly exothermic so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell durability service life and special requirements for some type of cells stationary fuel cell applications typically require more than 40,000 hours of reliable operation at a temperature of 35c to 40c 31f to 104f while automotive fuel cells require a 5,000-hour lifespan the equivalent of 240,000km 150,000mi under extreme temperatures current service life is 2,500 hours about 75,000 miles31 automotive engines must also be able to start reliably at 30c 22f and have a high power-to-volume ratio typically 2.5kw per liter limited carbon monoxide tolerance of some non-pedot cathodes phosphoric acid fuel cell pafcedit main article phosphoric acid fuel cell phosphoric acid fuel cells pafc were first designed and introduced in 1961 by g v elmore and h a tanner in these cells phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode these cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees celsius this high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly this heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system32 using this heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 4050 to about 80.32 phosphoric acid the electrolyte used in pafcs is a non-conductive liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate a key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte this increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid33 solid acid fuel cell safcedit main article solid acid fuel cell solid acid fuel cells safcs are characterized by the use of a solid acid material as the electrolyte at low temperatures solid acids have an ordered molecular structure like most salts at warmer temperatures between 140 and 150 degrees celsius for cshso4 some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered superprotonic structures which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude the first proof-of-concept safcs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate cshso434 current safc systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate csh2po4 and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours35 high-temperature fuel cellsedit sofcedit main article solid oxide fuel cell solid oxide fuel cells sofcs use a solid material most commonly a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia ysz as the electrolyte because sofcs are made entirely of solid materials they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes they require high operating temperatures 8001000c and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas36 sofcs are unique since in those negatively charged oxygen ions travel from the cathode positive side of the fuel cell to the anode negative side of the fuel cell instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode as is the case in all other types of fuel cells oxygen gas is fed through the cathode where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions the oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode the reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel but the carbon emissions from an sofc system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant37 the chemical reactions for the sofc system can be expressed as follows38 anode reaction 2h2 2o2 2h2o 4e cathode reaction o2 4e 2o2 overall cell reaction 2h2 o2 2h2o sofc systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas however since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms for the fuel cell to operate the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas sofcs are capable of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane natural gas39 propane and butane40 these fuel cells are at an early stage of development41 challenges exist in sofc systems due to their high operating temperatures one such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode which slows down the internal reforming process research to address this carbon coking issue at the university of pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based cermet heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal can reduce coking and the loss of performance42 another disadvantage of sofc systems is slow start-up time making sofcs less useful for mobile applications despite these disadvantages a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum thereby reducing cost additionally waste heat from sofc systems may be captured and reused increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 8085.36 the high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the ysz electrolyte as temperature decreases so does the ionic conductivity of ysz therefore to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell a high operating temperature is required according to their website ceres power a uk sofc fuel cell manufacturer has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their sofc system to 500600 degrees celsius they replaced the commonly used ysz electrolyte with a cgo cerium gadolinium oxide electrolyte the lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate which reduces cost and start-up time of the system43 hydrogen-oxygen fuel celledit the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell or alkaline fuel cell was designed and first demonstrated publicly by francis thomas bacon in 1959 it was used as a primary source of electrical energy in the apollo space program44 the cell consists of two porous carbon electrodes impregnated with a suitable catalyst such as pt ag coo etc the space between the two electrodes is filled with a concentrated solution of koh or naoh which serves as an electrolyte h2 gas and o2 gas are bubbled into the electrolyte through the porous carbon electrodes thus the overall reaction involves the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water the cell runs continuously until the reactants supply is exhausted this type of cell operates efficiently in the temperature range 343 k to 413 k and provides a potential of about 0.9 v45 mcfcedit main article molten carbonate fuel cell molten carbonate fuel cells mcfcs require a high operating temperature 650c 1,200f similar to sofcs mcfcs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte and this salt liquefies at high temperatures allowing for the movement of charge within the cell in this case negative carbonate ions46 like sofcs mcfcs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally the reforming process creates co2 emissions mcfc-compatible fuels include natural gas biogas and gas produced from coal the hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water carbon dioxide electrons and small amounts of other chemicals the electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode there oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte completing the circuit46 the chemical reactions for an mcfc system can be expressed as follows47 anode reaction co32 h2 h2o co2 2e cathode reaction co2 o2 2e co32 overall cell reaction h2 o2 h2o as with sofcs mcfc disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature this makes mcfc systems not suitable for mobile applications and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes the main challenge of mcfc technology is the cells short life span the high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode these factors accelerate the degradation of mcfc components decreasing the durability and cell life researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance36 mcfcs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies including their resistance to impurities they are not prone to carbon coking which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel reforming process therefore carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system the department of energy claims that coal itself might even be a fuel option in the future assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen36 mcfcs also have relatively high efficiencies they can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50 considerably higher than the 3742 efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant efficiencies can be as high as 65 when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine and 85 if heat is captured and used in a combined heat and power chp system46 fuelcell energy a connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer develops and sells mcfc fuel cells the company says that their mcfc products range from 300kw to 2.8mw systems that achieve 47 electrical efficiency and can utilize chp technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies one product the dfc-erg is combined with a gas

maximum efficiencyedit the energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system output energy to the total amount of energy that is put in input energy or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy in the case of fuel cells useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system input energy is the energy stored in the fuel according to the us department of energy fuel cells are generally between 4060 energy efficient56 this is higher than some other systems for energy generation for example the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25 energy efficient57 in combined heat and power chp systems the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 8590.36 the theoretical maximum efficiency of any type of power generation system is never reached in practice and it does not consider other steps in power generation such as production transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power however this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation the maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83 operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants assuming no heat recapture58 according to the world energy council this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58 for internal combustion engines58 while these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications high-temperature fuel cells solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit a gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cells operational efficiency this solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80.59 in practiceedit in a fuel-cell vehicle the tank-to-wheel efficiency is greater than 45 at low loads60 and shows average values of about 36 when a driving cycle like the nedc new european driving cycle is used as test procedure61 the comparable nedc value for a diesel vehicle is 22 in 2008 honda released a demonstration fuel cell electric vehicle the honda fcx clarity with fuel stack claiming a 60 tank-to-wheel efficiency62 it is also important to take losses due to fuel production transportation and storage into account fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22 if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas and 17 if it is stored as liquid hydrogen63 fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery64 except as hydrogen but in some applications such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system most hydrogen however is produced by steam methane reforming and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide65 the overall efficiency electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity of such plants known as round-trip efficiency using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be from 35 up to 50 percent depending on gas density and other conditions66 while a much cheaper leadacid battery might return about 90 the electrolyzerfuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen and is therefore better suited for long-term storage solid-oxide fuel cells produce heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen the ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees celsius this heat can be captured and used to heat water in a micro combined heat and power m-chp application when the heat is captured total efficiency can reach 8090 at the unit but does not consider production and distribution losses chp units are being developed today for the european home market professor jeremy p meyers in the electrochemical society journal interface in 2008 wrote while fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines they are not as efficient as batteries due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction and  the oxygen evolution reaction should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water they make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid or when fuel can be provided continuously for applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups  where zero emissions are a requirement as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses and where hydrogen is considered an acceptable reactant a pem fuel cell is becoming an increasingly attractive choice if exchanging batteries is inconvenient67 in 2013 military organisations are evaluating fuel cells to significantly reduce the battery weight carried by soldiers68 applicationsedit type 212 submarine with fuel cell propulsion of the german navy in dry dock poweredit stationary fuel cells are used for commercial industrial and residential primary and backup power generation fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations such as spacecraft remote weather stations large parks communications centers rural locations including research stations and in certain military applications a fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight and have no major moving parts because fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion in ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999 reliability69 this equates to less than one minute of downtime in a six-year period69 since fuel cell electrolyzer systems do not store fuel in themselves but rather rely on external storage units they can be successfully applied in large-scale energy storage rural areas being one example70 there are many different types of stationary fuel cells so efficiencies vary but most are between 40 and 60 energy efficient36 however when the fuel cells waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85.36 this is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants which are only about one third energy efficient71 assuming production at scale fuel cells could save 2040 on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems72 fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution other than co2 for every 1,000kwh produced compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems73 fuel cells also produce 97 less nitrogen oxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power plants one such pilot program is operating on stuart island in washington state there the stuart island energy initiative74 has built a complete closed-loop system solar panels power an electrolyzer which makes hydrogen

used to generate both electricity and heat for homes see home fuel cell office building and factories the system generates constant electric power selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed and at the same time produces hot air and water from the waste heat as the result chp systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems77 a typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 13kwel 48kwth.7879 chp systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration80 the

power generation and have electrical energy efficiences around 60.85 disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates high cost and short lifetime8687 also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium88 delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64 of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.68 the japanese ene farm project will pass 100,000 fc mchp systems in 2014 34.213 pemfc and 2.224 sofc were installed in the period 2012-2014 30,000 units on lng and 6,000 on lpg89 fuel cell electric vehicles fcevsedit main articles fuel cell vehicle hydrogen vehicle and list of fuel cell vehicles configuration of components in a fuel cell car toyota mirai element one fuel cell vehicle automobilesedit as of 2015 two fuel cell vehicles have been introduced for commercial lease and sale in limited quantities the toyota mirai and the hyundai ix35 fcev additional demonstration models include the honda fcx clarity and mercedes-benz f-cell90 as of june 2011 demonstration fcevs had driven more than 4,800,000km 3,000,000mi with more than 27,000 refuelings91 demonstration fuel cell vehicles have been produced with a driving range of more than 400km 250mi between refueling92 they can be refueled in less than 5 minutes93 the us department of energys fuel cell technology program claims that as of 2011 fuel cells achieved 5359 efficiency at one-quarter power and 4253 vehicle efficiency at full power94 and a durability of over 120,000km 75,000mi with less than 10 degradation92 in a well-to-wheels simulation analysis that did not address the economics and market constraints general motors and its partners estimated that per mile traveled a fuel cell electric vehicle running on compressed gaseous hydrogen produced from natural gas could use about 40 less energy and emit 45 less greenhouse gasses than an internal combustion vehicle95 a lead engineer from the department of energy whose team is testing fuel cell cars said in 2011 that the potential appeal is that these are full-function vehicles with no limitations on range or refueling rate so they are a direct replacement for any vehicle for instance if you drive a full sized suv and pull a boat up into the mountains you can do that with this technology and you cant with current battery-only vehicles which are more geared toward city driving96 in 2014 toyota introduced its first fuel cell vehicle in japan the mirai at a price of less than us10000097 although former european parliament president pat cox estimates that toyota will initially lose about 100,000 on each mirai sold98 hyundai introduced the limited production hyundai ix35 fcev99 other manufacturers that have announced intentions to sell fuel cell electric vehicles commercially by 2016 include general motors100 honda101 mercedes-benz102 and nissan103 criticismedit some experts believe that hydrogen fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive with other technologies104105106107 or that it will take decades for them to become profitable67108 elon musk stated in 2015 that fuel cells for use in cars will never be commercially viable because of the inefficiency of producing transporting and storing hydrogen and the flammability of the gas among other reasons104 professor jeremy p meyers estimated in 2008 that cost reductions over a production ramp-up period will take about 20 years after fuel-cell cars are introduced before they will be able to compete commercially with current market technologies including gasoline internal combustion engines67 in 2011 the chairman and ceo of general motors daniel akerson stated that while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing the car is still too expensive and probably wont be practical until the 2020-plus period i dont know109 in 2012 lux research inc issued a report that stated the dream of a hydrogen economy  is no nearer it concluded that capital cost  will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 gw by 2030 providing a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption except in niche applications the analysis concluded that by 2030 pem stationary market will reach 1 billion while the vehicle market including forklifts will reach a total of 2 billion108 other analyses cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the us as an ongoing challenge to fuel cell electric vehicle commercialization in 2006 a study for the ieee showed that for hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water only about 25 of the power generated from wind water or sun is converted to practical use the study further noted that electricity obtained from hydrogen fuel cells appears to be four times as expensive as electricity drawn from the electrical transmission grid  because of the high energy losses hydrogen cannot compete with electricity110 furthermore the study found natural gas reforming is not a sustainable solution110 the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds water natural gas biomass package the light gas by compression or liquefaction transfer the energy carrier to the user plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells leaves around 25 for practical use6067111 joseph romm the author of the hype about hydrogen 2005 devoted two articles in 2014 to updating his critique of the use of fuel cells in cars he stated that fcvs still had not overcome the following issues high cost of the vehicles high fueling cost and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades112 most importantly he said fcvs arent green because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced as 95 of it is using the steam reforming process he concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet either now or in the future105 greentech medias analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014.113 in 2015 clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles114 so did car throttle115 another clean technica writer concluded while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage especially seasonal storage it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles116 busesedit toyota fchv-bus at the expo 2005 as of august 2011update there were a total of approximately 100 fuel cell buses deployed around the world most buses are produced by utc power toyota ballard hydrogenics and proton motor utc buses had accumulated over 970,000km 600,000mi of driving by 2011.117 fuel cell buses have a 39141 higher fuel economy than diesel buses and natural gas buses118 fuel cell buses have been deployed around the world including in whistler canada san francisco united states hamburg germany shanghai china london england and so paulo brazil119 the fuel cell bus club is a global cooperative effort in trial fuel cell buses notable projects include 12 fuel cell buses are being deployed in the oakland and san francisco bay area of california119 daimler ag with 36 experimental buses powered

freight genco at wegmans coca-cola kimberly clark and whole foods and h-e-b grocers129 europe demonstrated 30 fuel cell forklifts with hylift and extended it with hylift-europe to 200 units130 with other projects in france 131132 and austria133 pike research stated in 2011 that fuel cell-powered forklifts will be the largest driver of hydrogen fuel demand by 2020.134 most companies in europe and the us do not use petroleum-powered forklifts as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts128135 fuel cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery-powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures the fc units are often designed as drop-in replacements136137 motorcycles and bicyclesedit in 2005 a british manufacturer of hydrogen-powered fuel cells intelligent energy ie produced the first working hydrogen run motorcycle called the env emission neutral vehicle the motorcycle holds enough fuel to run for four hours and

about a third in 2009 and the four dominant producers in the fuel cell industry were the united states germany japan and south korea179 the department of energy solid state energy conversion alliance found that as of january 2011 stationary fuel cells generated power at approximately 724 to 775 per kilowatt installed180 in 2011 bloom energy a major fuel cell supplier said that its fuel cells generated power at 911 cents per kilowatt-hour including the price of fuel maintenance and hardware181182 industry groups predict that there are sufficient platinum resources for future demand183 and in 2007 research at brookhaven national laboratory suggested that platinum could be replaced by a gold-palladium coating which may be less susceptible to poisoning and thereby improve fuel cell lifetime184 another method would use iron and sulphur instead of platinum this would lower the cost of a fuel cell as the platinum in a regular fuel cell costs around us1500 and the same amount of iron costs only around us150 the concept was being developed by a coalition of the john innes centre and the university of milan-bicocca185 pedot cathodes are immune to monoxide poisoning186 in 2016
