v t e wind power is the use of air flow through wind turbines to mechanically power generators for electricity wind power as an alternative to burning fossil fuels is plentiful renewable widely distributed clean produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation consumes no water and uses little land2 the net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of nonrenewable power sources wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electricity competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants345 offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electricity to isolated off-grid locations6 wind power gives variable power which is very consistent from year to year but which has significant variation over shorter time scales it is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply as the proportion of wind power in a region increases a need to upgrade the grid and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur78 power management techniques such as having excess capacity geographically distributed turbines dispatchable backing sources sufficient hydroelectric power exporting and importing power to neighboring areas using vehicle-to-grid strategies or reducing demand when wind production is low can in many cases overcome these problems910 in addition weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur111213 as of 2015 denmark generates 40 of its electricity from wind1415 and at least 83 other countries around the world are using wind power to supply their electricity grids16 in 2014 global

external links historyedit main article history of wind power charles brushs windmill of 1888 used for generating electricity wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind for more than two millennia wind-powered machines have ground grain and pumped water wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams or later requiring sources of fuel wind-powered pumps drained the polders of the netherlands and in arid regions such as the american mid-west or the australian outback wind pumps provided water for live stock and steam engines the first windmill used for the production of electricity was built in scotland in july 1887 by prof james blyth of andersons college glasgow the precursor of strathclyde university20 blyths 10 m high cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at marykirk in kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the frenchman camille alphonse faure to power the lighting in the cottage20 thus making it the first house in the world to have its electricity supplied by wind power21 blyth offered the surplus electricity to the people of marykirk for lighting the main street however they turned down the offer as they thought electricity was the work of the devil20 although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local lunatic asylum infirmary and dispensary of montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable20 across the atlantic in cleveland ohio a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 18871888 by charles f brush22 this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.23 the brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m 56 foot in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m 60 foot tower although large by todays standards the machine was only rated at 12kw the connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 incandescent light bulbs three arc lamps and various motors in brushs laboratory24 with the development of electric power wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging

production of electricity a large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes for example gansu wind farm the largest wind farm in the world has several thousand turbines a wind farm may also be located offshore almost all large wind turbines have the same design a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with three blades attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower in a wind farm individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage often 34.5 kv power collection system and communications network in general a distance of 7d 7 rotor diameter of the wind turbine is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm36 at a substation this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission systemcitation needed generator characteristics and stabilityedit induction generators which were often used for wind power projects in the 1980s and 1990s require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults in particular induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators today these generators arent used any more in modern turbines instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with partial- or full-scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have low voltage ride through-capabilities37 modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial-scale converters or squirrel-cage induction generators or synchronous generators both permanently and electrically excited with full scale converters38 transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid this will include power factor constancy of frequency and dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault3940 offshore wind

from china and the us43 in 2012 1,662 turbines at 55 offshore wind farms in 10 european countries produced 18 twh enough to power almost five million households44 as of august 2013 the london array in

transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system play media wind power in serbia a transmission line is required to bring the generated power to often remote markets for an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation one of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the united states is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind to high load locations usually on the coasts where population density is higher the current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy52 as transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased making it harder to transport large loads over large distances53 however resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electricity rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates a 2005 energy law gave the energy department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on but after an attempt to use this authority the senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so52 another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards these are important issues that need to be solved as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together in a process known as curtailment while this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service54 wind power capacity and productionedit main

more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 doubling about every three years the united states pioneered wind farms and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s in 1997 installed capacity in germany surpassed the us and led until once again overtaken by the us in 2008 china has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the us in 2010 to become the world leader as of 2011 83 countries around the world were using wind power on a commercial basis16 wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 gw in june 2014 and wind energy production was around 4 of total worldwide electricity usage and growing rapidly18 the actual amount of electricity that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor which varies according to equipment and location estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of 35 to 44.58 europe accounted for 48 of the world total

capacity of wind power will be 792.1 gw by the end of 202062 and 4,042 gw by end of 2050.65 the increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electricity in some cases wind onshore is already the cheapest electricity generation option and costs are continuing to decline the contracted prices for wind onshore for the next few years are now as low as 30 usdmwh in the eu in 2015 44 of all new generating capacity was wind power while in the same period net fossil fuel power capacity decreased19 capacity factoredit since wind speed is not constant a wind farms annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year the ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor typical capacity factors are 1550 values at the upper end of the range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements6667nb 1 online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output6869 for example the german nationwide average wind power capacity factor over all of 2012 was just under 17.5 45867gwhyr29.9gw243660.1746,70 and the capacity factor for scottish wind farms averaged 24 between 2008 and 2010.71 unlike fueled generating plants the capacity factor is affected by several parameters including the variability of the wind at the site and the size of the generator relative to the turbines swept area a small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electricity and thus less profit in high winds conversely a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and depending on the type may stall out at low wind speed thus an optimum capacity factor of around 4050 would be aimed for6772 a 2008 study released by the us department of energy noted that the capacity factor of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves and projected further improvements for future capacity factors73 in 2010 the department estimated the capacity factor of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45.74 the annual average capacity factor for wind generation in the us has varied between 29.8 and 34.0 during the period 20102015.75 penetrationedit country penetration denmark

wind compared with the total generation the wind power penetration in world electricity generation in 2015 was 3.5.8384 there is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration the limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants pricing mechanisms capacity for energy storage demand management and other factors an interconnected electricity grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures this reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations studies have indicated that 20 of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty85 these studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity demand management and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electricity when needed beyond the 20 level there are few technical limits but the economic implications become more significant electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics86878889 a wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different durations of time but is often quoted annually to obtain 100 from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage on a monthly weekly daily or hourly basisor lesswind might supply as much as or more than 100 of current use with the rest stored or exported seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand such industry might include production of silicon aluminum90 steel or of natural gas and hydrogen and using future long term storage to facilitate 100 energy from variable renewable energy9192 homes can also be programmed to accept extra electricity on demand for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats93 in australia the state of south australia generates around half of the nations wind power capacity by the end of 2011 wind power in south australia championed by premier and climate change minister mike rann reached 26 of the states electricity generation edging out coal for the first time94 at this stage south australia with only 7.2 of australias population had 54 of australias installed capacity7894 variabilityedit main article variable renewable energy wind turbines are typically installed in favourable windy locations in the image wind power generators in spain near an osborne bull electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales hourly daily or seasonally annual variation also exists but is not as significant because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation incremental operating reserve and at high penetration levels could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management load shedding storage solutions or system interconnection with hvdc cables fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil-fuel generating units require reserve capacity that can also compensate for variability of wind generation increase in system operation costs euros per mwh for 10 20 wind share7 country 10 20 germany 2.5 3.2 denmark 0.4 0.8 finland 0.3 1.5 norway 0.1 0.3 sweden 0.3 0.7 wind power is variable and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power are unlike those of conventional power generation plants which when scheduled to be operating may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95 of the time presently grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of natural gas spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electricity in the event that conditions are not favorable for power production from the wind at lower wind power grid penetration this is less of an issue959697 ge has installed a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery similar to that of an electric car equivalent of 1minute of production despite the small capacity it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15minutes as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent the battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants98 a report on denmarks wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1 of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002.99 wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness or interlinking with hvdc100 electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power99 according to a 2007 stanford university study published in the journal of applied meteorology and climatology interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33 of the total energy produced ie about 8 of total nameplate capacity to be used as reliable baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height101102 conversely on particularly windy days even with penetration levels of 16 wind power generation can surpass all other electricity sources in a country in spain in the early hours of 16 april 2012 wind power production reached the highest percentage of electricity production till then at 60.46 of the total demand103 in denmark which had power market penetration of 30 in 2013 over 90hours wind power generated 100 of the countrys power peaking at 122 of the countrys demand at 2am on 28 october104 a 2006 international energy agency forum presented costs for managing intermittency as a function of wind-energys share of total capacity for several countries as shown in the table on the right three reports on the wind variability in the uk issued in 2009 generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account but it does not make the grid unmanageable the additional costs which are modest can be quantified8 the combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location forecasting their variation and integrating them with dispatchable renewables flexible fueled generators and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world105 in 2009 eight american and three european authorities writing in the leading electrical engineers professional journal didnt find a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids in fact not one of more than 200 international studies nor official studies for the eastern and western us regions nor the international energy agency has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30 variable renewable supplies into the grid and in some studies much more reinventing fire105 solar power tends to be complementary to wind106107 on daily to weekly timescales high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier on seasonal timescales solar energy peaks in summer whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winternb 2108 thus the intermittencies of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat in 2007 the institute for solar energy supply technology of the university of kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar wind biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year entirely from renewable sources109 further information grid balancing predictabilityedit main article wind power forecasting wind power forecasting methods are used but predictability of any particular wind farm is low for short-term operation for any particular generator there is an 80 chance that wind output will change less than 10 in an hour and a 40 chance that it will change 10 or more in 5hours.110 however studies by graham sinden 2009 suggest that in practice the variations in thousands of wind turbines spread out over several different sites and wind regimes are smoothed as the distance between sites increases the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites decreases111 thus while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable13112 wind power hardly ever suffers major technical failures since failures of individual wind turbines have hardly any effect on overall power so that the distributed wind power is reliable and predictable113unreliable source whereas conventional generators while far less variable can suffer major unpredictable outages energy storageedit main article grid energy storage see also list of energy storage projects the sir adam beck generating complex at niagara falls canada includes a large pumped-storage hydroelectricity reservoir during hours of low electrical demand excess electrical grid power is used to pump water up into the reservoir which then provides an extra 174 mw of electricity during periods of peak demand typically conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well when the wind is blowing strongly nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water when the wind drops they can provided they have the generation capacity rapidly increase production to compensate this gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water alternatively where a suitable head of water is not available pumped-storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed the type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level low penetration requires daily storage and high penetration requires both short and long term storage as long as a month or more stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods the potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage the cost of storage may add 25 to the cost of any wind energy stored but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated for example in the uk the 1.7 gw dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75 efficient and have high installation costs their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs114115 in particular geographic regions peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power in the us states of california and texas for example hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of air conditioning some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 more efficient116 widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds a possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an hvdc super grid in the us it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least 60 billion117 while the society value of added windpower would be more than that cost82 germany has an installed capacity of wind and solar that can exceed daily demand and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kilowatt hours in 2012.118 a more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80 of demand which will become necessary when most of europes energy is obtained from wind power and solar power just as the eu requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electricity storage instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering119 capacity credit fuel savings and energy paybackedit the capacity credit of wind is estimated by determining the capacity of conventional plants displaced by wind power whilst maintaining the same degree of system security120121 according to the american wind energy association production of wind power in the united states in 2015 avoided consumption of 73 billion gallons of water and reduced co2 emissions by 132 million metric tons while providing 7.3 billion in public health savings122123 the energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life energy return on energy invested of wind power varies but averages about 2025.124125 thus the energy payback time is typically around one year economicsedit wind turbines reached grid parity the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources in some areas of europe in the mid-2000s and in the us around the same time falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in europe in 2010 and will reach the same point in the us around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12.126 electricity cost and trendsedit estimated cost per mwh for wind power in denmark the national renewable energy laboratory projects that the levelized cost of wind power in the us will decline about 25 from 2012 to 2030.127 a turbine blade convoy passing through edenfield in the uk 2008 even longer two-piece blades are now manufactured and then assembled on-site to reduce difficulties in transportation wind power is capital intensive but has no fuel costs128 the price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources129 the marginal cost of wind energy once a station is constructed is usually less than 1-cent per kwh130 however the estimated average cost per unit of electricity must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities borrowed funds return to investors including cost of risk estimated annual production and other components averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment which may be in excess of twenty years energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially in 2004 wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt turbines were mass-produced131 in 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 20082010 but still above 2002 levels132 a 2011 report from the american wind energy association stated winds costs have dropped over the past two years in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour recently about 2 cents cheaper than coal-fired electricity and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year winning more mainstream acceptance from wall streets banks equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles 5,600 mw of new installed capacity is under construction in the united states more than double the number at this point in 2010 thirty-five percent of all new power generation built in the united states since 2005 has come from wind more than new gas and coal plants combined as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves133 a british wind energy association report gives an average generation cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence between us 5 and 6 cents per kwh 2005.134 cost per unit of energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the us for coal and natural gas wind cost was estimated at 55.80 per mwh coal at 53.10mwh and natural gas at 52.50.135 similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the uk in 2011.136 in 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants it is also expected that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future137 the presence of wind energy even when subsidised can reduce costs for consumers 5 billionyr in germany by reducing the marginal price by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants138 an 2012 eu study shows base cost of onshore wind power similar to coal when subsidies and externalities are disregarded wind power has some of the lowest external costs139 in february 2013 bloomberg new energy finance bnef reported that the cost of generating electricity from new wind farms is cheaper than new coal or new baseload gas plants when including the current australian federal government carbon pricing scheme their modeling gives costs in australian dollars of 80mwh for new wind farms 143mwh for new coal plants and 116mwh for new baseload gas plants the modeling also shows that even without a carbon price the most efficient way to reduce economy-wide emissions wind energy is 14 cheaper than new coal and 18 cheaper than new gas140 part of the higher costs for new coal plants is due to high financial lending costs because of the reputational damage of emissions-intensive investments the expense of gas fired plants is partly due to export market effects on local prices costs of production from coal fired plants built in the 1970s and 1980s are cheaper than renewable energy sources because of depreciation140 in 2015 bnef calculated lcoe prices per mwh energy in new powerplants excluding carbon costs 85 for onshore wind 175 for offshore 6675 for coal in the americas 82105 in europe gas 80100.141142143 a 2014 study showed unsubsidized lcoe costs between 3781 depending on region144 a 2014 us doe report showed that in some cases power purchase agreement prices for wind power had dropped to record lows of 23.5mwh.145 the cost has reduced as wind turbine technology has improved there are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency also wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline146 for example the wind industry in the usa in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades capturing the faster winds at higher elevations this has opened up new opportunities and in indiana michigan and ohio the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio saying it is their cheapest option147 a number of initiatives are working to reduce costs of electricity from offshore wind one example is the carbon trust offshore wind accelerator a joint industry project involving nine offshore wind developers which aims to reduce the cost of offshore wind by 10 by 2015 it has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25 cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020.148 henrik stiesdal former chief technical officer at siemens wind power has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind will be one of the cheapest scalable solutions in the uk compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation149 he calculates the cost at that time to be 43 eurmwh for onshore and 72 eurmwh for offshore wind150 incentives and community benefitsedit us landowners typically receive 3,0005,000 annual rental income per wind turbine while farmers continue to grow crops or graze cattle up to the foot of the turbines151 shown the brazos wind farm texas some of the 6,000 turbines in californias altamont pass wind farm aided by tax incentives during the 1980s.152 the us wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity153 wind projects provide local taxes or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land151154 wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions either to increase its attractiveness or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities in the us wind power receives a production tax credit ptc of 1.5kwh in 1993 dollars for each kwh produced for the first ten years at 2.2 cents per kwh in 2012 the credit was renewed on 2 january 2012 to include construction begun in 2013.155 a 30 tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the ptc156157 another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation many american states also provide incentives such as exemption from property tax mandated purchases and additional markets for green credits158 the energy improvement and extension act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind including microturbines countries such as canada and germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation with assured grid access sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs these feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electricity prices159160 in december 2013 us senator lamar alexander and other republican senators argued that the wind energy production tax credit should be allowed to expire at the end of 2013161 and it expired 1 january 2014 for new installations secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power even if there is a premium price for the electricity for example socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure companies use wind-generated power and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong green efforts in the us the organization green-e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits162 small-scale wind poweredit further information microgeneration a small quietrevolution qr5 gorlov type vertical axis wind turbine on the roof of colston hall in bristol england measuring 3m in diameter and 5m high it has a nameplate rating of 6.5kw small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kw of electrical power163 isolated communities that may otherwise rely on diesel generators may use wind turbines as an alternative individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electricity for economic reasons or to reduce their carbon footprint wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas164 recent examples of small-scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in new york city where since 2009 a number of building projects have capped their roofs with gorlov-type helical wind turbines although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings overall consumption they help to reinforce the buildings green credentials in ways that showing people your high-tech boiler can not with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the new york state energy research and development authority165 grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage thus replacing purchased electricity with locally produced power when available the surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can in some jurisdictions be fed into the network and sold to the utility company producing a retail credit for the microgenerators owners to offset their energy costs166 off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine equipment such as parking meters traffic warning signs street lighting or wireless internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine possibly combined with a photovoltaic system that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid167 a carbon trust study into the potential of small-scale wind energy in the uk published in 2010 found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours twh per year of electricity 0.4 of total uk electricity consumption saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide mt co2 emission savings this is based on the assumption that 10 of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity around 12 pence us 19 cents a kwh168 a report prepared for the uks government-sponsored energy saving trust in 2006 found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40 of the countrys electricity needs by 2050.169 distributed generation from renewable resources is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of climate change the electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the utility system can include additional functions such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality170 environmental effectsedit main article environmental impact of wind power livestock grazing near a wind turbine171 the environmental impact of wind power when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels is relatively minor according to the ipcc in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 gco2eqkwh depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed172173 compared with other low carbon power sources wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated174 while a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use175176 there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures the scale of the ecological impact may177 or may not178 be significant depending on specific circumstances prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs179 affect the siting and operation of wind turbines wind turbines generate some noise at a residential distance of 300 metres 980ft this may be around 45db which is slightly louder than a refrigerator at 1.5km 1mi distance they become inaudible180181 there are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines182 peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims183184185 the united states air force and navy have expressed concern that siting large wind turbines near bases will negatively impact radar to the point that air traffic controllers will lose the location of aircraft186 aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are significant187 conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes politicsedit central governmentedit part of the seto hill windfarm in japan nuclear power and fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments and wind power and other forms of renewable energy are also often subsidized for example a 2009 study by the environmental law institute188 assessed the size and structure of us energy subsidies over the 20022008 period the study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately 72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled 29 billion in the united states the federal government has paid us74billion for energy subsidies to support rd for nuclear power 50 billion and fossil fuels 24 billion from 1973 to 2003 during this same time frame renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of us26billion it has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors namely solar power wind power and biofuels189 history shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies189 according to the international energy agency iea 2011 energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits190 in november 2011 an iea report entitled deploying renewables 2011 said subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits the ieas report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand in the us the wind power industry has recently increased its lobbying efforts considerably spending about 5 million in 2009 after years of relative obscurity in washington191 by comparison the us nuclear industry alone spent over 650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten-year period ending in 2008.192193194 following the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents germanys federal government is working on a new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization with a particular focus on offshore wind farms under the plan large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land and where the enormous turbines wont bother the inhabitants the plan aims to decrease germanys dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants195 public opinionedit environmental group members are both more in favor of wind power 74 as well as more opposed 24 few are undecided surveys of public attitudes across europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power196197198 about 80 of eu citizens support wind power199 in germany where wind power has gained very high social acceptance hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 of germanys electricity200201 although wind power is a popular form of energy generation the construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed often for aesthetic reasons175196197198199202203 in spain with some exceptions there has been little opposition to the installation of inland wind parks however the projects to build offshore parks have been more controversial204 in particular the proposal of building the biggest offshore wind power production facility in the world in southwestern spain in the coast of cdiz on the spot of the 1805 battle of trafalgar205 has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area206 and because the area is a war grave205 which should be increased in scotland207 in a survey conducted by angus reid strategies in october 2007 89 per cent of respondents said that using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power was positive for canada because these sources were better for the environment only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be unreliable and expensive208 according to a saint consulting survey in april 2007 wind power was the alternative energy source most likely to gain public support for future development in canada with only 16 opposed to this type of energy by contrast 3 out of 4 canadians opposed nuclear power developments209 a 2003 survey of residents living around scotlands 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms the results of this survey support those of an earlier scottish executive survey public attitudes to the environment in scotland 2002 which found that the scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy210 a survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74 of people in scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs when people were asked the same question in a scottish renewables study conducted in 2010 78 agreed the increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005 the 2010 survey also showed that 52 disagreed with the statement that wind farms are ugly and a blot on the landscape 59 agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant211 regarding tourism query responders consider power pylons cell phone towers quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms212 scotland is planning to obtain 100 of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.213 in other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects the hundreds of thousands of people who have become involved in germanys small and medium-sized wind farms demonstrate such support there214 this 2010 harris

about wind farms wind turbines such as these in cumbria england have been opposed for a number of reasons including aesthetics by some sectors of the population217218 many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms219220221 in other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects appropriate government consultation planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks196222223 some may still object to wind farms224 but according to the australia institute their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community225 in america wind projects are reported to boost local tax bases helping to pay for schools roads and hospitals wind projects also revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners151 in the uk both the national trust and the campaign to protect rural england have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms226227 a panoramic view of the united kingdoms whitelee wind farm with lochgoin reservoir in the foreground some wind farms have become tourist attractions the whitelee wind farm visitor centre has an exhibition room a learning hub a caf with a viewing deck and also a shop it is run by the glasgow science centre228 in denmark a loss-of-value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine the loss must be at least 1 of the propertys value229 despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects230231232 for example there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect tv and radio reception and doppler weather radar as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values233 potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection234235 a study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected236 while aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity protest groups are often formed to attempt to block new wind power sites for various reasons224237238 this type of opposition is often described as nimbyism239 but research carried out in 2009 found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to renewable power facilities such as

kinetic energy into electrical power the result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering todays wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types the smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid arrays of large turbines known as wind farms have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind241 a wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the winds energy point the turbine into the wind convert mechanical rotation into electrical power and other systems to start stop and control the turbine in 1919 the german physicist albert betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind-energy extraction machine the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 1627 59.3 of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured this betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs which may reach 70 to 80 of the theoretical betz limit242243 the aerodynamics of a wind turbine are not straightforward the air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine the very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine in addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields the shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade244 in addition to the aerodynamic design of the blades the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installations rotor hub nacelle tower structure generator controls and foundation245 further design factors must also be considered when integrating wind turbines into electrical power grids wind energyedit map of available

the global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1.50 mjm2 over the period from 1979 to 2010 1.31 mjm2 in the northern hemisphere with 1.70 mjm2 in the southern hemisphere the atmosphere acts as a thermal engine absorbing heat at higher temperatures releasing heat at lower temperatures the process is responsible for production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 wm2 sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation248 a global 1km2 map of wind resources is housed at httpirenamasdaracaemap103  based on calculations by the technical university of denmark249250251 the total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources252 axel kleidon of the max planck institute in germany carried out a top down calculation on how much wind energy there is starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere he concluded that somewhere between 18 tw and 68 tw could be extracted253 cristina archer and mark z jacobson presented a bottom-up estimate which unlike kleidons are based on actual measurements of wind speeds and found that there is 1700 tw of wind power at an altitude of 100metres over land and sea of this between 72 and 170 tw could be extracted in a practical and cost-competitive manner253 they later estimated 80 tw254 however research at harvard university estimates 1 wattm2 on average and 210 mwkm2 capacity for large scale wind farms suggesting that these estimates of total global wind resources are too high by a factor of about 4.255 the strength of wind varies and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there to assess prospective wind power sites a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data256 different locations will have different wind speed distributions the weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourlyten-minute wind speeds at many locations the weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a rayleigh
