fishing26 it is believed by some scholarswho that early in the first millennium bc several waves of celts invaded portugal from central europe and inter-married with the local populations forming different ethnic groups with many tribes chief among these tribes were the calaicians or gallaeci of northern portugal the lusitanians of central portugal the celtici of alentejo and the cynetes or

fond of de melo and with the queen mothers approval he appointed melo as minister of foreign affairs as the kings confidence in de melo increased the king entrusted him with more control of the state by 1755 sebastio de melo was made prime minister impressed by british economic success that he had witnessed from the ambassador he successfully implemented similar economic policies in portugal he abolished slavery in portugal and in the portuguese colonies in india reorganized the army and the navy restructured the university of coimbra and ended discrimination against different christian sects in portugal but sebastio de melos greatest reforms were economic and financial with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity he demarcated the region for production of port to ensure the wines quality and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in europe he ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class along with a widespread review of the countrys tax system these reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes especially

rebuilding the city with his famous quote what now we bury the dead and take care of the living despite the calamity and huge death toll lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt the new city centre of lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes architectural models were built for tests and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models the buildings and big squares of the pombaline city centre still remain as one of lisbons tourist attractions sebastio de melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country the 1755 lisbon earthquake devastated the country with an estimated magnitude between 8.59.0 following the earthquake
