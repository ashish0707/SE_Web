world consumption of primary energy by energy type1 energy consumption per capita per country 2001 red hues indicate increase green hues decrease of consumption during the 1990s.2 the environmental impact of the energy industry is diverse energy has been harnessed by human beings for millennia initially it was with the use of fire for light heat cooking and for safety and its use can be traced back at least 1.9 million years3 in recent years there has been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources consumption of fossil fuel resources leads to global warming and climate change in most parts of the world little change is being made to slow these changes if the peak oil theory proves true and more explorations of viable alternative energy sources are made our impact could be less hostile to our environment rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation water and waste management and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of systems ecology and industrial ecology45 contents 1 issues 1.1 climate change 1.2 biofuel use 1.2.1 bio-diesel 1.2.2 firewood 1.3 fossil fuel

external links issuesedit climate changeedit global mean surface temperature anomaly relative to 19611990 main article attribution of recent climate change the scientific consensus on global warming and climate change is that it is caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the majority of which comes from burning fossil fuels with deforestation and some agricultural practices being also major contributors6 although there is a highly publicized denial of climate change the vast majority of scientists working in climatology accept that it is due to human activity the ipcc report climate change 2007 climate change impacts adaptation and vulnerability predicts that climate change will cause shortages of food and water and increased risk of flooding that will affect billions of people particularly those living in poverty7 one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparisons between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the paul scherrer institut and the university of stuttgart which was funded by the european commission8 according to that study9 hydroelectric electricity produces the lowest co2 emissions wind produces the second-lowest nuclear energy produces the third-lowest and solar photovoltaic produces the fourth-lowest9 similarly the same research study externe externalities of energy undertaken from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30 if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health from the airborne particulate matter nitrogen oxides chromium vi and arsenic emissions produced by these sources were taken into account it was estimated in the study that these external downstream fossil fuel costs amount up to 1-2 of the eus entire gross domestic product gdp and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included10 the study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power per unit of energy delivered was 0.0019kwh which was found to be lower than that of many renewable sources including that caused by biomass and photovoltaic solar panels and was thirty times lower than coal at 0.06kwh or 6 centskwh with the energy sources of the lowest external environmental and health costs associated with it being wind power at 0.0009kwh.11 biofuel useedit further information environmental impact of biofuels biofuel is defined as solid liquid or gaseous fuel obtained from relatively recently lifeless or living biological material and is different from fossil fuels which are derived from long-dead biological material various plants and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacturing bio-dieseledit main article environmental effects of biodiesel see also indirect land use change impacts of biofuels and sustainable biofuel high use of bio-diesel leads to land use changes including deforestation12 firewoodedit unsustainable firewood harvesting can lead to loss of biodiversity and erosion due to loss of forest cover an example of this is a 40-year study done by the university of leeds of african forests which account for a third of the worlds total tropical forest which demonstrates that africa is a significant carbon sink a climate change expert lee white states that to get an idea of the value of the sink the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests is at issue according to the un the african continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world once upon a time africa boasted seven million square kilometers of forest but a third of that has been lost most of it to charcoal13 fossil fuel useedit global fossil carbon emission by fuel type 1800-2007 ad the three fossil fuel types are coal petroleum and natural gas it was estimated by the energy information administration that in 2006 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.8 coal 26.6 natural gas 22.9 amounting to an 86 share for fossil fuels in primary energy production in the world14 in 2013 the burning of fossil fuels produced around 32 billion tonnes 32 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and additional air pollution this caused negative externalities of 4.9 trillion due to global warming and health problems 150 ton carbon dioxide15 carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that enhances radiative forcing and contributes to global warming causing the average surface temperature of the earth to rise in response which climate scientists agree will cause major adverse effects coaledit main article environmental impact of the coal industry the environmental impact of coal mining and burning is diverse16 legislation passed by the us congress in 1990 required the united states environmental protection agency epa to issue a plan to alleviate toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants after delay and litigation the epa now has a court-imposed deadline of march 16 2011 to issue its report petroleumedit main article environmental impact of the petroleum industry a beach after an oil spill the environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life the possibility of climate change exists petroleum commonly referred to as oil is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities gasedit natural gas is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel producing less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either coal or oil17 and far fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels however in absolute terms it does contribute substantially to global carbon emissions and this contribution is projected to grow according to the ipcc fourth assessment report18 in 2004 natural gas produced about 5,300 mtyr of co2 emissions while coal and oil produced 10,600 and 10,200 respectively figure 4.4 but by 2030 according to an updated version of the sres b2 emissions scenario natural gas would be the source of 11,000 mtyr with coal and oil now 8,400 and 17,200 respectively total global emissions for 2004 were estimated at over 27,200 mt in addition natural gas itself is a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released in smaller amounts electricity generationedit main article environmental impact of electricity generation the environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power this power is normally generated at power plants that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power each such system has advantages and disadvantages but many of them pose environmental concerns reservoirsedit main article environmental impact of reservoirs the environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases dams and the reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water generate hydroelectric power increasing the water supply for irrigation provide recreational opportunities and for flood control however adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimentalto both the environment and surrounding human populations has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that in 1960 the construction of llyn celyn and the flooding of capel celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day more recently the construction of three gorges dam and other similar projects throughout asia africa and latin america have generated considerable environmental and political debate nuclear poweredit main article environmental impact of nuclear power nuclear power activities involving the environment mining enrichment generation and geological disposal the environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle operation and the effects of nuclear accidents the routine health risks and greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear fission power are smaller than those associated with coal oil and gas however there is a catastrophic risk potential if containment fails19 which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment the most long-lived radioactive wastes including spent nuclear fuel must be contained and isolated from humans and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years the public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable public opposition to nuclear power the 1979 three mile island accident and 1986 chernobyl disaster along with high construction costs ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity19 a further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 japanese tsunami which damaged the fukushima i nuclear power plant resulting in hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns classified as a level 7 event the large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20km exclusion zone set up around the power plant similar to the 30km radius chernobyl exclusion zone still in effect wind poweredit main article environmental impact of wind power livestock grazing near a wind turbine the environmental impact of wind power when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels is relatively minor according to the ipcc in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 gco2eqkwh depending respectively on if offshore or onshore turbines are being assessed2021 compared with other low carbon power sources wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated22 while a wind farm may cover a large area of land many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use2324 there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures the scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant depending on specific circumstances prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities and protection of peat bogs affect the siting and operation of wind turbines there are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines25 peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims26 aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are significant27 conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes mitigationedit energy
