crystallinebedrock an enhanced geothermal system egs generates geothermal electricity without the need for natural convective hydrothermal resources until recently geothermal power systems have exploited only resources where naturally occurring heat water and rock permeability are sufficient to allow energy extraction1 however by far most of geothermal energy within reach of conventional techniques is in dry and impermeable rock2 egs technologies enhance andor create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock hdr through hydraulic stimulation when natural cracks and pores do not allow economic flow rates the permeability can be enhanced by pumping high-pressure cold water down an injection well into the rock the injection increases the fluid pressure in the naturally fractured rock triggering shear events that enhance the systems permeability as long as the injection pressure is maintained a high matrix permeability is not required nor are hydraulic fracturing proppants required to maintain the fractures in an open state this process is termed hydro-shearing3 perhaps to differentiate it from hydraulic tensile fracturing used in the oil and gas industry which can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures4 water travels through fractures in the rock capturing the rocks heat until forced out of a second borehole as very hot water the waters heat is converted into electricity using either a steam turbine or a binary power plant system5 all of the water now cooled is injected back into the ground to heat up again in a closed loop egs technologies can function as baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day unlike hydrothermal egs may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth good locations are over deep granite covered by a 35 kilometres 1.93.1mi layer of insulating sediments that slow heat loss6 an egs plant is expected to have an economical lifetime of 20-30 years using

technology8 on 30 may 2007 then australian opposition environmental spokesperson and former minister for the environment heritage and the arts peter garrett announced that if elected at the 2007 australian federal election the australian labor party would use taxpayer money to subsidise putting the necessary drilling rigs in place in an interview he promised there are some technical difficulties and challenges there but those people who are keen on getting australia into geothermal say weve got this great access to resource and one of the things interestingly thats held them back is not having the capacity to put the drilling plants in place and so what we intend this 50 million to go towards is to provide one-for-one dollars match 1 from us 1 from the industry so that they can get these drilling rigs on to site and really get the best sites identified and get the industry going9 european unionedit the eus egs rd project at soultz-sous-forts france has recently connected

article hot dry rock geothermal energy the first egs effort then termed hot dry rock took place at fenton hill new mexico with a project run by the federal los alamos laboratory16 it was the first attempt to make a deep full-scale egs reservoir the egs reservoir at fenton hill was first completed in 1977 at a depth of about 2.6km with rock temperatures of 185 c in 1979 the reservoir was enlarged with additional hydraulic stimulation and was operated for about 1 year the results demonstrated that heat could be extracted at reasonable rates from a hydraulically stimulated region of low-permeability hot crystalline rock in 1986 a second reservoir was prepared for initial hydraulic circulation and heat extraction testing in a 30-day flow test with a constant reinjection temperature of 20 c the production temperature steadily increased to about 190 c corresponding to a thermal power level of about 10 mw due to budget cuts further study at fenton hill was discontinued working at the edgesusing egs technology to improve hydrothermal resourcesedit egs funding languished for the next few years and by the next decade us efforts focused on the less ambitious goal of improving the productivity of existing hydrothermal resources according to the fiscal year 2004 budget request to congress from does office of energy efficiency and renewable energy 17 egs are engineered reservoirs that have been created to extract heat from economically unproductive geothermal resources egs technology includes those methods and equipment that enhance the removal of energy from a resource by increasing the productivity of the reservoir better productivity may result from improving the reservoirs natural permeability andor providing additional fluids to transport heat18 in fiscal year 2002 preliminary designs for five projects employing egs technology were completed and the coso hot springs geothermal field at the us naval weapons air station in china lake california was selected for full-scale development two additional projects were selected for preliminary analysis at desert peak in nevada and glass mountain in california funding for this effort totaled 1.5 million the effort was continued in 2003 with an additional 3.5 million 19 in 2009 the us department of energy usdoe issued two funding opportunity announcements foas related to enhanced geothermal systems together the two foas offered up to 84 million over six years 20 the doe followed up with another foa in 2009 of stimulus funding from the american reinvestment and recovery act for 350 million including 80 million aimed specifically at egs projects21 forgeedit in february 2014 the department of energy announced the intent to establish a dedicated subsurface laboratory called the frontier observatory for research in geothermal energy forge22 in order to investigate and develop enhanced geothermal technology in april 2015 it was announced that the proposed sites had been narrowed to five expected to be reduced to at most three the following year23 eventually the selected site will host the forge laboratory which will provide annual solicitations for research to be performed there induced seismicityedit main article induced seismicity some induced seismicity is inevitable and expected in egs which involves pumping fluids at pressure to enhance or create permeability through the use of hydro-shearing and hydraulic fracturing techniques hydro-shear stimulation methods seek to expand and extend the connectivity of the rocks existing fractures to create a better fluid network for the transfer of heat from the rock to the fluid2425 seismicity events at the geysers geothermal field in california have been strongly correlated with injection data26 the case of induced seismicity in basel merits special mention it led the city which is a partner to suspend the project and conduct a seismic hazard evaluation which resulted in the cancellation of the project in december 2009.27 according to the australian government risks associated with hydrofracturing induced seismicity are low compared to that of natural earthquakes and can be reduced by careful management and monitoring and should not be regarded as an impediment to further development of the hot rock geothermal energy resource28 however the risks of induced seismicity vary from site to site and should be considered before large scale fluid injection is begun co2 egsedit the geothermal energy centre of excellence at the university of queensland has been awarded aud 18.3 million for egs research a large portion of which will be used to develop co2 egs technologies research conducted at los alamos national laboratories and lawrence berkeley national laboratories examined the use of supercritical co2 instead of water as the geothermal working fluid with favorable results co2 has numerous advantages for egs greater power output minimized parasitic losses from pumping and cooling carbon sequestration minimized water use co2 has a much lower tendency to dissolve minerals and other substances than water which greatly reduces scaling and corrosion of system components co2 is however much more expensive and somewhat more difficult to work with than water egs potential in the united statesedit geothermal power technologies a 2006 report by mit7 and funded by the us department of energy conducted the most comprehensive analysis to date on the potential and technical status of egs the 18-member panel chaired by professor jefferson tester of mit reached several significant conclusions resource size the report calculated the united states total egs resources from 310km of depth to be over 13,000zettajoules of which over 200zj would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over 2,000zj with technology improvements sufficient to provide all the worlds current energy needs for several millennia7 the report found that total geothermal resources including hydrothermal and geo-pressured resources to equal 14,000 zj or roughly 140,000 times the total us annual primary energy use in 2005 development potential with an rd investment of 1 billion over 15 years the report estimated that 100gwe gigawatts of electricity or more could be installed by 2050 in the united states the report further found that recoverable resources accessible with todays technology were between 1.212.2tw for the conservative and moderate recovery scenarios respectively cost the report found that egs could be capable of producing electricity for as low as
