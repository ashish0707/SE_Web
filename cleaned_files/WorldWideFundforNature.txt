ecological practices the advisory council included leading scientists such as charles sutherland elton g evelyn hutchinson aldo leopold carl sauer and paul sears8 it supported much of the scientific work cited by rachel carsons silent spring including that of john l george roger hale robert rudd and george woodwell in 1963 the foundation held a conference and published a major report warning of anthropogenic global warming written by noel eichhorn based on the work of foundation vice-president frank fraser darling edward deevey erik eriksson charles keeling gilbert plass lionel walford and william garnett9 in 1990 the conservation foundation was merged into wwf after becoming an affiliate of wwf in 1985 when it became a distinct legal entity but with the same staff and board the organization now known as the conservation foundation in the united states is the former forest foundation of dupage county1011 morges manifestoedit the idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was initially proposed by victor stolan to sir julian huxley in response to articles he published in the british newspaper the observer this proposal led huxley to put stolan in contact with max nicholson a person who had had thirty years experience of linking progressive intellectuals with big business interests through the political and economic planning think tank11213 nicholson thought up the name of the organization wwf was conceived on 29 april 1961 under the name of world wildlife fund and its first office was opened on 11 september that same year in morges switzerland wwf was conceived to act as a funding institution for existing conservations groups such as the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources and the conservation foundation10 godfrey a rockefeller also played an important role in its creation assembling the first staff2 its establishment marked with the signing of the morges manifesto14 the founding document that sets out the funds ideology the wwf hot air balloon in brazil they need above all money to carry out missions and to meet conservation emergencies by buying land where wildlife treasures are threatened money for example to pay guardians of wildlife refuges for educations among those who would care for sending experts to danger spots and training making it all possible that their needs are met before it is too late morges manifesto later historyedit wwf has set up offices and operations around the world it originally worked by fundraising and providing grants to existing non-governmental organizations based on the best-available scientific knowledge and with an initial focus on the protection of endangered species as more resources became available its operations expanded into other areas such as the preservation of biological diversity sustainable use of natural resources the reduction of pollution and climate change the organization also began to run its own conservation projects and campaigns and by the 1980s started to take a more strategic approach to its conservation activities in 1986 the organization changed its name to world wide fund for nature while retaining the wwf initials however it continued at that time to operate under the original name in the united states and canada7 that year was the 25th anniversary of wwfs foundation an event marked by a gathering in assisi italy to which the organizations international president hrh prince philip the duke of edinburgh invited religious authorities representing buddhism christianity hinduism islam and judaism these leaders produced the assisi declarations theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world15 in the 1990s wwf revised its mission statement to stop the degradation of the planets natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature by conserving the worlds biological diversity ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable and promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption wwf scientists and many others identified 238 ecoregions that represent the worlds most biologically outstanding terrestrial freshwater and marine habitats based on a worldwide biodiversity analysis which the organization says was the first of its kind16 in the early 2000s decade its work was focused on a subset of these ecoregions in the areas of forest freshwater and marine habitat conservation endangered species conservation climate change and the elimination of the most toxic chemicals we shant save all we should like to but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried sir peter scott17 in 1996 the organization obtained general consultative status from unesco panda symboledit the giant panda has become the symbol of wwf wwfs giant panda logo originated from a panda named chi chi that had been transferred from beijing zoo to london zoo in 1958 three years before wwf became established the logo was founded by young and was founded in 1966 being famous as the only panda residing in the western world at that time its uniquely recognisable physical features and status as an endangered species were seen as ideal to serve the organizations need for a strong recognisable symbol that would overcome all language barriers18 moreover the organization also needed an animal that would have an impact in black and white printing the logo was then designed by sir peter scott from preliminary sketches made by gerald watterson a scottish naturalist1920 however the logo shown on this page is not the logo designed by peter scott but a later one designed for wwf when it changed its name from world wildlife fund to world wide fund for naturecitation needed 21st centuryedit wwfs strategy for achieving its mission specifically focuses on restoring populations of 36 species species or species groups that are important for their ecosystem or to people including elephants tunas whales dolphins and porpoises and ecological footprint in 6 areas carbon emissions cropland grazing land fishing forestry and watercitation needed the organization also works on a number of global issues driving biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of natural resources including finance business practices laws and consumption choices local offices also work on national or regional issues21 wwf works with a large number of different groups to achieve its goals including other ngos governments business investment banks scientists fishermen farmers and local communities it also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly mannerit urges people to donate funds to protect the environment the donors can also choose to receive gifts in returncitation needed publicationsedit wwf publishes the living planet index in collaboration with the zoological society of london along with ecological footprint calculations the index is used to produce a bi-yearly living planet report giving an overview of the impact of human activity on the world22 the organization also regularly publishes reports fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work in order to raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers23 policy-makingedit policies of the wwf are made by the board members who are elected for three- year terms the executive team guides and develops wwfs strategy there is also a national council which stands as an advisory group to the board and finally a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for wwf national and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used laws and regulations become one of the organizations global priorities the wwf has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the canadian tar sands and has campaigned on this matter between 2008 and 2010 the wwf worked with the co-operative group the uks largest consumer co-operative to publish reports which concluded that 1 exploiting the canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as runaway climate change24 2 carbon capture and storage ccs technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction25 3 the 379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from tar sands could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology26 and 4 the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in alberta 27 the organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt enforce strengthen andor change policies guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use it also ensures the governments to consent andor keeps their commitment to international instruments relating to the protection of biodiversity and natural resources2829 in 2012 david nussbaum chief executive of wwf-uk spoke out against the way shale gas is used in the uk saying the government must reaffirm its commitment to tackling climate change and prioritise renewables and energy efficiency30 controversiesedit corporate partnershipsedit wwf has been accused by the campaigner corporate watch of being too close to businesses to campaign objectively3132 wwf claims partnering with corporations such as coca-cola lafarge carlos slims and ikea will reduce their effect on the environment33 wwf received 56 million us80 million from corporations in 2010 an 8 increase in support from corporations compared to 2009 accounting for 11 of total revenue for the year3 project lockedit in 1988 prince bernhard previously wwfs first president sold paintings for gbp700000 to raise money for the world wildlife fund the money was deposited in a swiss wwf bank account in 1989 charles de haes then wwf director-general transferred gbp500000 back to bernhard for what he de haes called a private project it was then revealed in 1991 that prince bernhard had used the money to hire kas international owned by sas founder david stirling for an operation called project lock during which mercenaries mostly british fought poachers in nature reserves34 mekong river dolphins reportedit in june 2009 touch seang tana chairman of cambodias commission for conservation and development of the mekong river dolphins eco-tourism zone charged that the wwf had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the mekong dolphin in order to boost fundraising35 the report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins immune systems36 he called the report unscientific and harmful to the cambodian government and threatened the wwfs cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims37 touch seang tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent wwf from continuing its work in cambodia but advised wwf to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report after this in january 2012 touch seang tana signed the kratie declaration on the conservation of the mekong river irrawaddy dolphin along with wwf and the cambodian fisheries administration an agreement binding the parties to work together on a roadmap addressing dolphin conservation in the mekong river38 pandaleaksedit in 2012 german investigative journalist wilfried huissmann published a book called the silence of the pandas it became a bestseller in germany but was banned from britain until 2014 when it was released under the title of pandaleaks after a series of injunctions and court orders39 the book criticizes wwf for its supposed involvement with corporations that are responsible for large-scale destruction of the environment such as coca-cola and gives details into the existence of the secret 1001 club whose members huismann claims continue to have an unhealthy influence on wwfs policy making39 however wwf has sought to deny the allegations made against it40 ard documentaryedit this sections factual accuracy is disputed please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced see the relevant discussion on the talk page july 2011 learn how and when to remove this template message the german public television ard aired a documentary on 22 june 2011 that claimed to show how the wwf cooperates with corporations such as monsanto providing sustainability certification in exchange for donations essentially greenwashing41 wwf has denied the allegations42 by encouraging high-impact eco-tourism the program alleges that wwf contributes to the destruction of habitat and species it claims to protect wwf-india is not active at the tiger reserve given as the examplecitation needed but it is active elsewhere seeking to limit adverse tourism effects and better sharing of tourism benefits to local communities the program also alleges wwf certified a palm oil plantation operated by wilmar international a singaporean company on the indonesian island of borneo even though the establishment of the plantation led to the destruction of over 14,000 hectares of rainforest only 80 hectares were ultimately conserved the ard documentary claims according to the programme two orangutans live on the conserved land but have very slim chances of survival because no fruit trees remain and the habitat is too small to sustain them to survive they steal palm nuts from the neighbouring plantation thereby risking being shot by plantation workers wwf notes that the plantation filmed is pt rimba harapan sakti which has not been certified as a sustainable producer by the round table on sustainable palm oil aerial photographs show that around 4000 hectares or about a third of the forest cover has been conservedcitation needed huntingedit the president of honor of wwf in spain used to be king juan carlos i43 who has been a known hunting enthusiast in 1962 when he was 24 years old he was invited by the german baron werner von alvensleben to a hunt in mozambique44 since then the king has taken part in hunting forays in africa and eastern europe in october 2004 he was a member of a hunt in romania that killed a wolf and nine brown bears including one that was pregnant according to the romanian newspaper romania libera45 he was also accused by a russian official of killing a bear called mitrofan supposedly after giving vodka to the animal in an episode that sparked controversy in spain although the claim was never proven46 in the same year according to the guardian the polish government allowed him to kill a european bison in biaowiea forest even though it is an endangered species47 further controversy arose in april 2012 when the kings participation in an elephant hunt in botswana was discovered only after he returned to spain on an emergency flight after tripping over a step and fracturing his hip48 many spanish environmental groups and leftist parties criticized the monarchs hobby49 and the wwf stripped him of the honorary position in july 2012 in an extraordinary assembly by 94 of the votes of the members50 prince charles the uk head of the wwf51 has stated that he enjoys hunting52 he is believed however to adhere to legal british traditional hunting and speaks out against hunting endangered speciescitation needed alleged human-rights abusesedit in a 2016 complaint to the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd the nonprofit group survival international accused wwf of inadvertently facilitating serious human-rights abuses against indigenous pygmy inhabitants of the rainforest in cameroon the complaint alleged that anti-poaching eco-guards who were part-funded and logistically helped by wwf victimised the hunter gatherer baka people razed to the ground their camps destroyed or confiscated their property forced them to relocate and have regularly used physical force and threats of violence against them53 it was the first such complaint to be made against a conservation group the complaint alleges that wwf violated oecd guidelines for the conduct of multinational companies and the un declaration of human rights wwf responded saying that eco-guards were for the most part protecting the integrity and resources of a forest zoning system that includes community forests hunting and access zones vital to baka communities the group disclaimed knowledge of any direct involvement by its staff in rights abuses53 survival international has also accused wwf of violating its own policies regarding indigenous peoples rights by forming a partnership with french logging company rougier which it says is responsible for large areas of deforestation in southeast cameroon illegally and without the consent of local baka tribespeople54 wwf france stated in 2015 that it had entered a three-year strategic collaboration with the rougier group55 presidentsedit prince bernhard of lippe-biesterfeld in 1942 years name 19611976 prince bernhard of
