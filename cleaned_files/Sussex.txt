turn derived from the old english suth-seaxe which means land or people of the south saxons8 cf essex middlesex and wessex the south saxons were a germanic tribe that settled in the region from the north german plain during the 5th and 6th centuries the earliest known usage of the term south saxons latin australes saxones is in a royal charter of 689 which names them and their king nohelm although the term may well have been in use for some time before that the monastic chronicler who wrote up the entry classifying the invasion seems to have got his dates wrong recent scholars have suggested he might have been a quarter of a century too late9 the new latin word suthsexia was used for sussex by dutch cartographer joan blaeu in his 1645 map10 three united states counties in

in 1622 by john speed azure six martlets or the flag of sussex consists of six gold martlets or heraldic swallows on a blue background blazoned as azure six martlets or officially recognised by the flag institute on 20 may 2011 its design is based on the heraldic shield of sussex that first appeared in an atlas by john speed in 1622 the significance of the six martlets may be to represent the traditional six sub-divisions of the county known as rapes it may also be a canting reference to the title of the historic leading sussex family the earls of arundel seated at arundel castle in the county as the french for swallow is hirondelle the round-headed rampion or pride of sussex is sussexs county flower sussex by the sea is regarded as the unofficial anthem of sussex it was composed by

sunniest places in the united kingdom12 the coast has consistently more sunshine than the inland areas sea breezes blowing off the sea tend to clear any cloud from the coast13 most of sussex lies in hardiness zone 8 the exception is the coastal plain west of brighton which lies in the milder zone 9 rainfall is below average with the heaviest precipitation on the south downs with 950mm 37in of rainfall per year13 the close proximity of sussex to the continent of europe results in cold spells in winter and hot humid weather in summer13 the climate of the coastal districts is strongly influenced by the sea which because of its tendency to warm up slower than land can result in cooler temperatures than inland in the summer in the autumn months the coast sometimes has higher temperatures13 rainfall during the summer months is mainly from thunderstorms and thundery showers from january to march the heavier rainfall is due to prevailing south-westerly frontal systems13 in winter the east winds can be as cold as further inland13 selsey is known as a tornado hotspot with small tornadoes hitting the town in 1986 1998 and 2000,12 with the 1998 tornado causing an estimated

population would be 70,000 in 1693 the county is stated to have contained 21,537 houses the 1801 census found that the population was 159,311 the decline of the sussex ironworks probably accounts for

many more refugees were added to the county the area of the ancient county is 933,887 acres 377,931ha with a population in 1891 of 550,446 and in 1901 of 605,202 historyedit main article history of

conquest of england in september 1066 william of normandy landed with his forces at pevensey and erected a wooden castle at hastings from which they raided the surrounding area3031 the battle was fought between duke william of normandy and the english king harold godwinson who had strong connections with sussex and whose chief seat was probably in bosham32 after having marched his exhausted army all the way from yorkshire harold fought the normans at the battle of hastings where englands army was defeated and harold was killed it is likely that all the fighting men of sussex were at the battle as the countys thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated33 william built battle abbey at the site of the battle with the exact spot where harold fell marked by the high altar33 sussex experienced some of the greatest changes of any english county under the normans for it was the heartland of king harold and was potentially vulnerable to further invasion34 the county was of great importance to the normans hastings and pevensey being on the most direct route for normandy35 the countys existing sub-divisions known as rapes were made into castleries and each territory was given to one of williams most trusted barons castles were built to defend the territories including at arundel bramber lewes pevensey and hastings sussexs bishop thelric ii was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with and william the conquerors personal chaplain stigand36 the normans also built chichester cathedral and moved the seat of sussexs bishopric from selsey to chichester

battle of lewes in which simon de montfort and his fellow barons captured prince edward later edward i the son and heir of henry iii the subsequent treaty known as the mise of lewes led to montfort

albeit on a lesser scale with several people being executed for their catholic beliefs9 sussex escaped the worst ravages of the english civil war although in 1642 there were sieges at arundel and chichester and a skirmish at haywards heath when royalists marching towards lewes were intercepted by local parliamentarians the royalists were routed with around 200 killed or taken prisoner40

with an increasing amount of them becoming unemployed those in work faced their wages being forced down41 conditions became so bad that it was even reported to the house of lords in 1830 that four harvest labourers seasonal workers had been found dead of starvation41 the deteriorating conditions of work for the agricultural labourer eventually triggered riots first in neighbouring kent and then in sussex where they lasted for several weeks although the unrest continued until 1832 and became known as the swing riots4142 railways spread across sussex in the 19th century and county councils were created for sussexs eastern and western divisions in 1889 during world war i on the eve of the battle of the somme on 30 june 1916 the royal sussex regiment took part in the battle of the boars head at richebourg-lavou43 the day subsequently became known as the day sussex died43 over a period of less than five hours the 17 officers and 349 men were killed including 12 sets of brothers including three from one family43 a further 1,000 men were wounded or taken prisoner43 with the declaration of the world war ii sussex found itself part of the countrys frontline with its airfields playing a key role in the battle of britain and with its towns being some of the most frequently bombed44 as the sussex regiments served overseas the defence of the county was undertaken by units of the home guard with help from the first canadian army4445 during the lead up to the d-day landings the people of sussex were witness to the buildup of military personnel and materials including the
