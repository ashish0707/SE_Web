renewable energy in india comes under the purview of the ministry of new and renewable energy mnre newer renewable electricity sources are targeted to grow massively by 2022 including a more than doubling of indias large wind power capacity and an almost 15 fold increase in solar power from april 2016 levels such ambitious targets would place india amongst the world leaders in renewable energy use and place india at the centre of its international solar alliance project promoting the growth and development of solar power internationally to over 120 countries india was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of non-conventional energy resources in early 1980s as of 30th april 2016 indias cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity excluding large hydro reached about 42.85 gw123 surpassing the installed capacity of large scale hydroelectric power in india for the first time in indian history 63 of the renewable power came from wind while solar contributed nearly 16.4 large hydro installed capacity was 42.78 gw as of 30 april 2016 and is administered separately by the ministry of power and not included in mnre targets from 2015 onwards the mnre began laying down actionable plans for the renewable energy sector under its ambit to make a quantum jump building on strong foundations already established in the country 5 mnre renewable electrictricity targets have been upscaled to grow from just under 43 gw in april 2016 to 175 gw by the year 2022 including 100 gw from solar power 60 gw from wind power 10 gw from bio power and 5 gw from small hydro power5 the ambitious targets would see india quickly becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the world and surpassing numerous developed countries the government intends to achieve 40 cumulative electric power capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030.5 contents 1 renewable energy overview and targets 1.1 grid connected renewable electricity 1.2 off-grid renewable

sources under the responsibility of the ministry of new and renewable energy by april 2016 wind power was the leading source of renewable power with 26.9 gw installed capacity almost two thirds of the total renewable power installed capacity next came solar power with 6.8 gw installed capacity and biomass power with 4.8 gw accounting for 15.8 and 11.3 of the total renewable power installed capacity small hydro power accounted for 4.3 gw and waste-to-power accounted for just over 0.1 gw installed capacity total installed renewable power capacity in this category was just under 43 gw by april 2016 in terms of meeting its ambitious 2022 targets as of april 30 2016 wind power was almost half way towards its goal whilst solar power was below 7 of its highly ambitious target although expansion is expected to be dramatic in the near future bio energy was also at just under half way towards its target whilst small hydro installed grid power capacity all source in india as of april 30 20167 res

wind power in india the development of wind power in india began in the 1990s and has significantly increased in the last few years although a relative newcomer to the wind industry compared with denmark or the us domestic policy support for wind power has led india to become the country with the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world8 as of march 31 2016 the installed

densely populated and has high solar insolation an ideal combination for using solar power in india much of the country does not have an electrical grid so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping to begin replacing indias four to five million diesel powered water pumps each consuming about 3.5kilowatts and off-grid lighting some large projects have been proposed and a 35,000km area of the thar desert has been set aside for solar power projects sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100gigawatts the indian solar loan programme supported by the united nations environment programme has won the prestigious energy globe world award for sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches particularly in rural areas of south india where the electricity grid does not yet extend2021 launched in 2003 the indian solar loan programme was a four-year partnership between unep the unep risoe centre and two of indias largest banks the canara bank and syndicate bank21 announced in november 2009 the government of india proposed to launch its jawaharlal nehru national solar mission under the national action plan on climate change with plans to generate 1,000mw of power by 2013 and up to 20,000mw grid-based solar power 2,000mw of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020.22 the mission aims to achieve grid parity electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid by 2020 achieving this target would establish india as a global leader in solar power generation23 indian electrical and

solid waste msw and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of india in addition large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries waste generation in india is expected to increase rapidly in the future as more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase consumption levels are likely to rise as are rates of waste generation it is estimated that the amount of waste generated in india will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33 annually this has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal
