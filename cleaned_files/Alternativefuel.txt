and can be easily transported to the place of use almost all fuels are chemical fuels the user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work such as powering an engine it may also be used to generate electricity which is then used for heating lighting or other purpose biofueledit main article biofuel alternative fuel dispensers at a regular gasoline station in arlington virginia b20 biodiesel at the left and e85 ethanol at the right biofuels are also considered a renewable source although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels biomassedit main article biomass biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production algae-based fuelsedit main article algae fuel algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production1 algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the us navy2 algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices3 biodieseledit biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha soybean sunflowers corn olive peanut palm coconut safflower canola sesame cottonseed etc once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol biodiesel is brought to lifeclarification needed from this chemical reaction these raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone despite ones mixture preference biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons than conventional diesel because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently even with regular diesels reduced quantity of sulfur from the ulsd ultra-low sulfur diesel invention biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free4 alcohol fuelsedit main articles alcohol fuel butanol fuel ethanol fuel and methanol fuel methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy these alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels butanol has another advantage it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad carscitation needed ammoniaedit ammonia nh3 can be used as fuel56 benefits of ammonia include no need for oil zero emissions low cost and distributed production reducing transport and related pollutioncitation needed carbon-neutral and negative fuelsedit carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuelsuch as methane gasoline diesel fuel or jet fuelproduced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater78910 such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases1112 to the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation131415 such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the fischertropsch process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels161718 part of a series about environmental economics concepts green accounting

carbon diet food miles 2000-watt society carbon footprint v t e carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency and enabling transmission of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles16 germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts192021 audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas lng plant in werlte germany22 the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity23 other commercial developments are taking place in columbia south carolina24 camarillo california25 and darlington england26 the least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be extracted for about us 7.50 per ton91217 automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting27 since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied2829 researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about 50 per ton10 carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between 600 and 1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration1213 nighttime wind power is consideredby whom the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the us averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009 but only 0.71 centskwh during the least expensive six hours of the day16 typically wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 centskwh during the day30 commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than 55 per barrel31 the us navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about 6 per gallon while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010 it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about 8 per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive32 however us civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power33 the navys estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than 1 per gallon34 hydrogen formic acidedit main article hydrogen fuel hydrogen is an emissionless fuel the byproduct of hydrogen burning is water although some mono-nitrogen oxides nox are produced when hydrogen is burned with air3536 main article formic acid another fuel is formic acid the fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen and using that in a fuel cell formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen3738 hydrogencompressed natural gas mixtureedit main article hcng hcng or h2cng is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4-9 percent hydrogen by energy39 liquid nitrogenedit liquid nitrogen is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel compressed airedit the air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel unlike hydrogen compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel making it an economically attractive alternative fuel propane autogasedit main article autogas propane is a cleaner burning high performance fuel derived from multiple sources it is known by many names including propane lpg liquified propane gas lpa liquid propane autogas autogas and others propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply liquid storage at low pressure an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels40 propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 11241 depending on the composition of the butanepropane ratios of the mixture propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an intercooler effect reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density42 the resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion propane lacks additives detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe the cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions lower nox due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products it is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of propane to the market propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly 5bar 73psi of pressure fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to compressed natural gas which is usually kept at over 3,000psi 210bar in a vehicle format propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles natural gas vehiclesedit compressed natural gas cng and liquified natural gas lng are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels compressed natural gas fuel typesedit compressed natural gas cng vehicles can use both renewable cng and non-renewable cng43 conventional cng is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today new technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way44 renewable natural gas or biogas is a methanebased gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel present sources of biogas are mainly landfills sewage and animalagriwaste based on the process type biogas can be divided into the following biogas produced by anaerobic digestion landfill gas collected from landfills treated to remove trace contaminants and synthetic natural gas sng43 practicalityedit around the world this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles and just over 150,000 of these are in the us45 american usage is growing at a dramatic rate46 environmental analysisedit because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles47 tailpipe co2 can be reduced by 1525 compared to gasoline diesel48 the greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty light duty and refuse truck segments48 co2 reductions of up to 88 are possible by using biogas49 similarities to hydrogen natural gas like hydrogen is another fuel that burns cleanly cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines also none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together50 nuclear power and radiothermal generatorsedit main articles nuclear power and radiothermal generator nuclear reactorsedit nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions the only controlled method now practical uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay use of the nuclear reaction nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical but is an active area of research nuclear power is usually used by using a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water which is then used to create steam pressure which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water today more than 15 of the worlds electricity comes from nuclear power and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built in theory electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight some smaller reactors such as the topaz nuclear reactor are built to minimize moving parts and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly making them useful for space missions but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft all of them unmanned the soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in rorsat military radar satellites where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the earths oceans the us also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965 in the snap-10a mission no nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988 thorium fuelled nuclear reactorsedit thorium-based nuclear power reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years it is being backed by many scientists and researchers and professor james hansen the former director at nasa goddard institute for space studies has reportedly said after studying climate change for over four decades its clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels safer cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution51 thorium is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than uranium and its ore monazite is commonly found in sands along bodies of water thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium while uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners thorium is taken from open pits5253 monazite is present in countries such as australia the united states and india in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years54 as an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors thorium has been proven to add to proliferation produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium-99 half-life over 200,000 years55 and has a longer fuel cycle53 for a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors see thorium fuel cyclelist of thorium fueled reactors radiothermal generatorsedit in addition radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels on both land and in space their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened the decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak and low temperatures is a problem radiothermal generators rtgs which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has in turn been produced on earth
