wind-hydro capacity providing 48,118 gwh of power and 19 of the countrys total electricity production in that year1 in earlier periods wind energy covered 16 of the demand in 2010 13.8 in 2009 and 11.5 in 2008 following the fallout from the financial crisis in 2008 and the dire straits of the spanish economy in the subsequent period new installations of new wind turbines all but stagnated between 2012 and 2015 remaining at close to 23,000 mw installed capacity for the entire period whilst spain put expansion on ice the other world leading countries continued to expand or accelerated new wind turbine installations and by 2015 india had moved ahead of spain in total installations as of end 2015 the countries when ranked by total installations were 1 china 2 usa 3 germany 4 india 5 spain and 6 united kingdom2 in 2009 for the first time in the annual calculation wind overtook coal that produced 33,844 gwh in 2010 43,692 gwh of wind electricity was produced in spain with an end of year installed capacity of over 20 gw representing 20 of capacity and 16 of production3 wind was the third biggest energy source in the country exceeded by thermal gas combined cycle at 68,828 gwh and

renewable energy is wind power uppermost among the 17 autonomous regions of spain16 navarre europes sixth largest producer of wind power currently sustains approximately 70 percent of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources wind farms being used most extensively and has a 900-megawatt capacity of installed wind power navarre lacks thermal nuclear coal oil gas fields or hefty hydro-electric power stations but does possess considerable wind renewable resources which the government of navarre pursued to drop its external energy dependence17 navarre was entirely reliant on imported energy until wind-power development and utilization began progress in 1996.16 galiciaedit galicia currently leads in wind power development in the autonomous regions for the third consecutive year with an increase in wind power of 264 mw succeeding castilla la mancha which exceeded the development goal of 1000 mw and followed by aragon navarre and castile-len and the remaining autonomous regions15 castilla leon and la rioja have initiated wind energy production and the north-eastern area of soria also holds the capacity to be an efficient producer the possession of workable resources for wind power development is also represented in the cantabrian eastern and south-eastern coasts15 researchedit largely concerned with advancing energy efficiency use in spain the institute for energy saving and diversification idae also seeks to expand renewable energy sources and energies15 research concerning the production of hydrogen from electrolysis of water by a wind farm began in 2004 at a newly installed laboratory in the universidad pblica de navarra under an agreement between energa hidroelctrica de navarra stuart energy systems of canada and statkraft of norway the lab replicated the power generation environment of a wind farm and examined the effects of an electrolyzer18 concentrated research is occurring concerning wind measurement in the albacete region at higueruela15 wind power industryedit the spanish wind energy sector now hosts the involvement of over 500 companies with approximately 150 wind turbine production plants and their machinery across the spanish regions19 the assets of the spanish industry are being noticed and acted upon by financial analysts as united states ernst and young in 2005 ranked the wind market in spain among the uppermost in its index of long-term country attractiveness20 including those indirectly employed in supplying components and services the total number of jobs supported by spains wind industry has reached more than 30 000 and is estimated to double to 60 000 by 2010 2005.19 gamesa elicaedit main article gamesa corporacin tecnolgica gamesa based in the basque country is a large global wind turbine manufacturer with 13 share by installed power in 2005.21 the company values the distinctive geographical setting of spain as a benefit to spanish companies competing in the global arena20 gamesa elica currently operates plants in spain the us and china it has projects in many other parts of the world including egypt germany ireland italy japan korea and portugal20 gamesa opened a manufacturing plant for wind turbine generator blades in philadelphia pennsylvania in 2005 creating 500 part-time building and operations jobs and 236 permanent manufacturing jobs the building operation and upkeep of gamesas wind farms in conjunction with its two philadelphia offices and production plant formed about 1,000 jobs in the state over a five-year period22 the company seeks expansion into greece taiwan and the united kingdom20 ecotcnia alstom windedit main article alstom ecotcnia ecotcnia established 1981 and by 2005 had 2.1 world market share by installed capacity23 with wind turbines in production of up to 1.6mw.24 in 2009 the company was acquired by alstom for 350million.25 the company continued to develop wind turbines a 3mw machine was installed in a commercial windfarm in 2009.26 in 2010 the company was renamed alstom wind27 in 20112 the company developed a prototype 6mw permanent magnet gearless generator for offshore applications in association with lm wind power and converteam28 acciona energyedit main article acciona energy acciona energy acciona energa the biggest global wind-park developer currently operates in australia canada france germany morocco spain and the united states20 the company credits its success to its initial stages in navarre during 1994 its line of work involves wind-farm operation turbine manufacture and the development of wind-power plants and the company intends to expand into china ireland and the united kingdom20 iberdrolaedit main article iberdrola iberdrola currently holds functioning facilities in brazil france greece italy mexico portugal spain the united states and the united kingdom and is continuing to develop wind farms in europe and latin america202 as of 2008 iberdrola plans to develop six offshore wind farm projects with a combined generation capacity of 3000 mw at locations off the coasts of the spanish atlantic provinces of cadiz huelva and the mediterranean province of castellon29 mtorresedit mtorres initiated their activities in the wing energy field in 1998 with the launch of their newly developed wind turbine twt-1570 a 1500 kw variable-speed direct-drive multipole wind turbine with a full-power converter and a 70 meters rotor diameter exportsedit the national spanish wind energy industry has begun to export its wind generators by forming contracts for the erection of wind farms in china india and mexico as well as cuba where work began in 1998 2007 they also have contracts at a highly developed stage with portugal turkey tunisia egypt brazil and argentina15 the wind energy capacity for major companies in spain was the following as of 2007 gamesa elica 3281 mw made 803 mw neg micon 715 mw ecotcnia 446 mw g electric 343 mw izar-bonus 317 mw desa awp 121 mw enercon 58 mw lagerwey 38 mw and others 113 mw 2007.15 future developmentedit three factors will control the further progress of wind power development in spain the capability of the wind farms network to hold all the electricity harnessed by wind power predominantly in off-peak times the cost of energy and the environmental effect that the abundance of wind farm development in spain could turn out17 the spanish wind power industry will be confronted with the following issues in the immediate future17 formulating its development to be congruent with required supply agreements by the national electricity supply operator guaranteeing that the installation of wind farms occurs with recognition of the environment synchronizing wind power development of the 17 autonomous regions trimming down the investment costs to acquire sufficient returns with declining energy prices in the upcoming years it is also noteworthy that the supportive spanish policies for wind power development have resulted in severe competition for construction sites among major companies17 political leaders in the autonomous communities have been frazzled by the numerous applications for wind farm construction17 local possession of wind power is not present in spain but does not appear to take away from further development of wind power in spain since a much smaller and weaker quantity of local anti-wind farm grid population inhabits the country30 however a further obstacle concerning wind power development needs to be tackled before spain can achieve these ambitious objectives construction of a central control center for all the spanish wind farms analogous to the control center used for traditional power plants20 oppositionedit with some exceptions there has been little opposition to the installation of inland wind parks however the projects to build offshore parks have been more controversial according to cohn et al31 the proposal of building the biggest offshore wind power production facility in the world in southwestern spain on the spot of the 1805 battle of trafalgar32 has been met with strong oppostition from the towns in the coast of cdiz who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area33 there have also been complaints by the british who claim that the area is a war grave and that any development of the area could destroy archaeological evidence of the historic battle32 see alsoedit renewable energy portal spain portal renewable energy in spain solar power in spain renewable energy by country wind power in the european union renewable energy
