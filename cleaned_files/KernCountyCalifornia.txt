1824 between the chumash indians of the santa barbara mission who rebelled against the mexican governments taking over mission property and ejecting the natives this battle with mexican forces from monterey under the command of carlos carrillo took place at the canyon where san emigdio creek flows down san emigdio mountain and the blue ridge south of bakersfield near todays highway 166 it was a low-casualty encounter with only four indians killed and no mexicans the surviving indians were pacified and brought back to santa barbara in june 1824 after a pursuit and negotiation in which many were allowed to keep their arms for the return march over the mountains6 american eraedit the havilah court building was restored in the 1970s and now serves as a museum photo circa 2007 in the beginning the area that became kern county was dominated by mining in the mountains and in the desert in 1855 an attempt to form a county in the area was made when the california legislature took the southeastern territory of tulare county on the west of the sierra nevada mountains for buena vista county but it was never officially organized prior to 1859 when the time of the enabling legislation ran out the south of tulare county was later organized as kern county in 1866 with additions from los angeles and san bernardino counties its first county seat was in the mining town of havilah in the mountains between bakersfield and tehachapicitation needed the flatlands were considered inhospitable and impassable at the time due to swamps lakes tule reeds and diseases such as malaria this

ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed both in the
