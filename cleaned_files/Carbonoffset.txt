greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for or to offset an emission made elsewhere1234 carbon offsets are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent co2e and may represent six primary categories of greenhouse gases5 carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o perfluorocarbons pfcs hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and sulfur hexafluoride sf66 one carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases there are two markets for carbon offsets in the larger compliance market companies governments or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit this market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of annex 1 parties under the kyoto protocol and of liable entities under the eu emission trading scheme in 2006 about 5.5 billion of carbon offsets were purchased in the compliance market representing about 1.6 billion metric tons of co2e reductions7 in the much smaller voluntary market individuals companies or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation electricity use and other sources for example an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel many companies see list8 offer carbon offsets as an up-sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight car rental hotel stay consumer good etc in 2008 about 705 million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market representing about 123.4 million metric tons of co2e reductions9 some fuel suppliers in the uk offer fuel which has been carbon offset such as fuel dyes offsets are typically achieved through financial support of projects that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the short- or long-term the most common project type is renewable energy10 such as wind farms biomass energy or hydroelectric dams others include energy efficiency projects the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts destruction of landfill methane and forestry projects11 some of the most popular carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind turbine projects12 carbon offsetting has gained some appeal and momentum mainly among consumers in western countries who have become aware and concerned about the potentially negative environmental effects of energy-intensive lifestyles and economies the kyoto protocol has sanctioned offsets as a way for governments and private companies to earn carbon credits that can be traded on a marketplace the protocol established the clean development mechanism cdm which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely additional activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken organizations that are unable to meet their emissions quota can offset their emissions by buying cdm-approved certified emissions reductions emissions from burning fuel such as red diesel has pushed one uk fuel supplier to create a carbon offset fuel named carbon offset red diesel offsets may be cheaper or more convenient alternatives to reducing ones own fossil-fuel consumption however some critics object to carbon offsets and question the benefits of certain types of offsets13 due diligence is recommended to help businesses in the assessment and identification of good quality offsets to ensure offsetting provides the desired additional environmental benefits and to avoid reputational risk associated with poor quality offsets14 offsets are viewed as an important policy tool to maintain stable economies and to improve sustainability15 one of the hidden dangers of climate change policy is unequal prices of carbon in the economy which can cause economic collateral damage if production flows to regions or industries that have a lower price of carbonunless carbon can be purchased from that area which offsets effectively permit equalizing the price16 wind turbines near aalborg denmark renewable energy projects are the most common source of carbon offsets contents 1 definitions 2 features 3 carbon offset markets 3.1

vintage the vintage is the year in which the carbon reduction takes place17 source the source refers to the project or technology used in offsetting the carbon emissions projects can include land-use methane biomass renewable energy and industrial energy efficiency projects may also have secondary benefits co-benefits for example projects that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions may improve water quality by reducing fertilizer usage18 certification regime the certification regime describes the systems and procedures that are used to certify and register carbon offsets different methodologies are used for measuring and verifying emissions reductions depending on project type size and location19 for example the cdm uses another20 in the voluntary market a variety of industry standards exist these include the voluntary carbon standard and the cdm gold standard that are implemented to provide third-party verification of carbon offset projects14 there are some additional standards for the validation of co-benefits including the ccbs issued by the climate community biodiversity alliance and the social carbon standard21 issued by ecologica institute carbon offset marketsedit global marketedit in 2009 8.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent changed hands worldwide up 68 per cent from 2008 according to the study by carbon-market research firm point carbon of washington and oslo but at eur94 billion or about 135 billion the markets value was nearly unchanged compared with 2008 with world carbon prices averaging eur1140 a ton down about 40 per cent from the previous year according to the study22 the world banks state and trends of the carbon market 201023 put the overall value of the market at 144 billion but found that a significant part of this figure resulted from manipulation of a vat loophole24 90 of voluntary offset volumes were contracted by the private sector where corporate social responsibility and industry leadership were primary motivations for offset purchases25 offset buyers desire to positively impact the climate resilience of their supply chain or sphere of influence was evident in our data which identifies a strong relationship between buyers business sectors and the project categories from which they contract offsets25 eu marketedit the global carbon market is dominated by the european union where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market under the european union emission trading scheme eu ets europe which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years as the us and chinathe worlds top pollutershave yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies us marketedit on the whole the us market remains primarily a voluntary market but multiple cap and trade regimes are either fully implemented or near-imminent at the regional level the first mandatory market-based cap-and-trade program to cut co2 in the us called the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi kicked into gear in northeastern states in 2009 growing nearly tenfold to 2.5 billion according to point carbon western climate initiative wcia regional cap-and-trade program including seven western states california notably among them and four canadian provinceshas established a regional target for reducing heat-trapping emissions of 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 a component of californias own global warming solutions act of 2006 kicked off in early 2013 requires high-emissions industries to purchase carbon credits to cover emissions in excess of 25,000 co2 metric tons voluntary marketedit participants a wide range of participants are involved in the voluntary market including providers of different types of offsets developers of quality assurance mechanisms third party verifiers and consumers who purchase offsets from domestic or international providers suppliers include for-profit companies governments charitable non-governmental organizations colleges and universities and other groups26 motivations according to industry analyst ecosystem marketplace the voluntary markets present the opportunity for citizen consumer action as well as an alternative source of carbon finance and an incubator for carbon market innovation in their survey of voluntary markets data has shown that corporate social responsibility and public relationsbranding are clearly in first place among motivations for voluntary offset purchases with evidence indicating that companies seek to offset emissions for goodwill both of the general public and their investors in addition regarding market composition research indicates though many analysts perceive pre-compliance buying as a dominant driving force in the voluntary market the results of our survey have repeatedly indicated that precompliance motives as indicated by investmentresale and anticipation of regulation remain secondary to those of the pure voluntary market companiesindividuals offsetting their emissions27 pre-compliance trading the other main category of buyers on the voluntary markets are those engaged in pre-compliance andor trading those purchasing offsets for pre-compliance purposes are doing so with the expectation or as a hedge against the possibility of future mandatory cap and trade regulations as a mandatory cap would sharply increase the price of offsets firmsespecially those with large carbon footprints and the corresponding financial exposure to regulationmake the decision to acquire offsets in advance at what are expected to be lower prices the trading market in offsets in general resembles the trade in other commodities markets with financial professionals including hedge funds and desks at major investment banks taking positions in the hopes of buying cheap and selling dear with their motivation typically short or medium term financial gain retail multiple players in the retail market have offerings that enable consumers and businesses to calculate their carbon footprint most commonly through a web-based interface including a calculator or questionnaire and sell them offsets in the amount of that footprint28 in addition many companies selling products and services especially carbon-intensive ones such as airline travel2930 offer options to bundle a proportional offsetting amount of carbon credits with each transaction suppliers of voluntary offsets operate under both nonprofit and social enterprise models or a blended approach sometimes referred to as triple bottom line other suppliers include broader environmentally focused organizations with website subsections or initiatives that enable retail voluntary offset purchases by members and government created projects features of companies that voluntarily offset emissions companies that voluntarily offset their own emissions tend to be of relatively low carbon intensity as they can offset a significant proportion of their emissions at relatively low cost31 voluntary offsetting is particularly common in the financial sector 61 per cent of financial companies in the ftse 100 offset at least a portion of their 2009 emissions twenty-two per cent of financial companies in the ftse 100 considered their entire 2009 operations to be carbon neutral10 sources of carbon offsetsedit the cdm identifies over 200 types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets which are grouped into broad categories these project types include renewable energy methane abatement energy efficiency reforestation and fuel switching11 renewable energyedit renewable energy offsets commonly include wind power solar power hydroelectric power and biofuel some of these offsets are used to reduce the cost differential between renewable and conventional energy production increasing the commercial viability of a choice to use renewable energy sources renewable energy credits recs are also sometimes treated as carbon offsets although the concepts are distinct whereas a carbon offset represents a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions a rec represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources to convert recs into offsets the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid this is known as an indirect offset because the reduction doesnt take place at the project site itself but rather at an external site and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to additional emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur3233 intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the us34 methane collection and combustionedit some offset projects consist of the combustion or containment of methane generated by farm animals by use of an anaerobic digester35 landfills36 or other industrial waste methane has a global warming potential gwp 23 times that of co2 when combusted each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of co2 thus reducing the global warming effect by 96 an example of a project using an anaerobic digester can be found in chile where in december 2000 the largest pork production company in chile initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure in order to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions37 energy efficiencyedit chicago climate justice activists protesting cap and trade legislation in front of chicago climate exchange building in chicago loop this

this template message while carbon offsets that fund renewable energy projects help lower the carbon intensity of energy supply energy conservation projects seek to reduce the overall demand for energy carbon offsets in this category fund projects of several types cogeneration plants generate both electricity and heat from the same power source thus improving upon the energy efficiency of most power plants which waste the energy generated as heat fuel efficiency projects replace a combustion device with one using less fuel per unit of energy provided assuming energy demand does not change this reduces the carbon dioxide emitted energy-efficient buildings reduce the amount of energy wasted in buildings through efficient heating cooling or lighting systems in particular the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps can have a drastic effect on energy consumption new buildings can also be constructed using less carbon-intensive input materials destruction of industrial pollutantsedit industrial pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and perfluorocarbons pfcs have a gwp many thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume38 because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source they present a large and low-cost source of carbon offsets as a category hfcs pfcs and n2o reductions represent 71 per cent of offsets issued under the cdm11 land use land-use change and forestryedit land use land-use change and forestry lulucf projects focus on natural carbon sinks such as forests and soil deforestation particularly in brazil indonesia and parts of africa account for about 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions39 deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest-based products there is a class of mechanisms referred to as redd schemes reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation which may be included in a post-kyoto agreement redd credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations almost half of the worlds people burn wood or fiber or dung for their cooking and heating needscitation needed fuel-efficient cook stoves can reduce fuel wood consumption by 30 to 50 though the warming of the earth due to decreases in particulate matter ie smoke from such fuel-efficient stoves has not been addressed there are a number of different types of lulucf projects avoided deforestation is the protection of existing forests reforestation is the process of restoring forests on land that was once forested afforestation is the process of creating forests on land that was previously unforested typically for longer than a generation soil management projects attempt to preserve or increase the amount of carbon sequestered in soil purchase of carbon allowances from emissions trading schemesedit voluntary purchasers can offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon allowances from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative or the european emissions trading scheme by purchasing the allowances that power plants oil refineries and industrial facilities need to hold to comply with a cap voluntary purchases tighten the cap and force additional emissions reductions voluntary purchases can also be made through small-scale and sometimes uncertified schemes such as those offered at south african based promoting access to carbon equity centre pace40 which nevertheless offer clear services such as poverty alleviation in the form of renewable energy development also as easy carbon credits are coming to an end41 these projects have the potential to develop projects that are either too small or too complicated to benefit from legally mandated cap-and-trade programs links with emission trading schemesedit main article carbon credit once it has been accredited by the unfccc a carbon offset project can be used as carbon credit and linked with official emission trading schemes such as the european union emission trading scheme42 or kyoto protocol as certified emission reductions european emission allowances for the 20082012 second phase were selling for between 21 and 24 euros per metric ton of co2 as of july 2007 the voluntary chicago climate exchange also includes a carbon offset scheme that allows offset project developers to sell emissions reductions to ccx members who have voluntarily agreed to meet emissions reduction targets the western climate initiative a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative by states and provinces along the western rim of north america includes an offset scheme likewise the regional greenhouse gas initiative a similar program in the northeastern us includes an offset program a credit mechanism that uses offsets may be incorporated in proposed schemes such as the australian carbon exchange otheredit a uk offset provider set up a carbon offsetting scheme that set up a secondary market for treadle pumps in developing countries these pumps are used by farmers using human power in place of diesel pumps43 however given that treadle pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes it is not clear that the treadle pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns carbon retirementedit carbon retirement involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions under schemes such as the european union emission trading scheme eu emission allowances euas which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are issued to all the largest polluters the theory is that by buying these allowances and permanently removing them the price of euas increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions44 accounting for and verifying reductionsedit due to their indirect nature many types of offset are difficult to verify some providers obtain independent certification that their offsets are accurately measured to distance themselves from potentially fraudulent competitors the credibility of the various certification providers is often questioned certified offsets may be purchased from commercial or non-profit organizations for us2759900 per tonne of co245 due to fluctuations of market price annual carbon dioxide emissions in developed countries range from 6 to 23 tons per capita accounting systems differ on precisely what constitutes a valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems however formal standards for quantification exist based on collaboration between emitters regulators environmentalists and project developers these standards include the voluntary carbon standard green-e climate chicago climate exchange and the cdm gold standard the latter of which expands upon the requirements for the clean development mechanism of the kyoto protocol accounting of offsets may address the following basic areas baseline and measurementwhat emissions would occur in the absence of a proposed project and how are the emissions that occur after the project is performed going to be measured additionalitywould the project occur anyway without the investment raised by selling carbon offset credits there are two common reasons why a project may lack additionality a if it is intrinsically financially worthwhile due to energy cost savings and b if it had to be performed due to environmental laws or regulations permanenceare some benefits of the reductions reversible for example trees may be harvested to burn the wood and does growing trees for fuel wood decrease the need for fossil fuel if woodlands are increasing in area or density then carbon is being sequestered after roughly 50 years newly planted forests will reach maturity and remove carbon dioxide more slowly leakagedoes implementing the project cause higher emissions outside the project boundary co-benefitsedit overall carbon offsets improve the environment by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the earths atmosphere offset projects often also lead to a number of co-benefits such as better air and water quality and healthier communities46 while the primary goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions many offset projects also claim to lead to improvements in the quality of life for a local population these additional improvements are termed co-benefits and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects some possible co-benefits from a project that replaces wood-burning stoves with ovens using a less carbon-intensive fuel include lower nongreenhouse gas pollution smoke ash and chemicals which improves health in the home better preservation of forests which are an important habitat for wildlife in a recent survey conducted by ecosecurities conservation international ccba and climatebiz of the 120 corporates surveyed more than 77 per cent rated community and environmental benefits as the prime motivator for purchasing carbon offsets47 carbon offset projects can also negatively affect quality of life for example people who earn their livelihoods from collecting firewood and selling it to households could become unemployed if firewood is no longer used a paper from the overseas development institute offers some indicators to be used in assessing the potential developmental impacts of voluntary carbon offset schemes48 what potential does the project have for income generation what effects might a project have on future changes in land use and could conflicts arise from this can small-scale producers engage in the scheme what are the add on benefits to the countryfor example will it assist capacity-building in local institutions49 putting a price on carbon encourages innovation by providing funding for new ways to reduce greenhouse gases in many sectors carbon reduction goals drive the demand for offsets and carbon trading encouraging the development of this new industry and offering opportunities for different sectors to develop and use innovative new technologies46 carbon offset projects also provide savings energy efficiency measures may reduce fuel or electricity consumption leading to a potential reduction in maintenance and operating costs46 quality assurance schemesedit quality assurance standard for carbon offsetting qasedit in an effort to inform and safeguard business and household consumers purchasing carbon offsets in 2009,50 the uk government has launched a scheme for regulating carbon offset products51 defra have created the approved carbon offsetting brand to use as an endorsement on offsets52 approved by the uk government the scheme sets standards for best practice in offsetting approved offsets have to demonstrate the following criteria accurate calculation of emissions to be offset use of good quality carbon credits ie initially those that are kyoto compliant cancellation of carbon credits within a year of the consumers purchase of the offset clear and transparent pricing of the offset provision of information about the role of offsetting in tackling climate change and advice on how a consumer can reduce his or her carbon footprint the first company to qualify for the scheme was clear followed by carbon footprint carbon passport pure british airways and carbon retirement ltd on 20 may 2011 the department of energy and climate change announced that the quality assurance scheme would close on 30 june 2011.53 the stated purpose of the quality assurance scheme was to provide a straightforward route for those wishing to offset their emissions to identify quality offsets53 critics of the closure therefore argued that without the scheme businesses and individuals would struggle to identify quality carbon offsets54 in 2012 the scheme was relaunched as the quality assurance standard qas55 the qas is now run independently by quality assurance standard ltd which is a company limited by guarantee based in the united kingdom the quality assurance standard is a comprehensive independent audit system for carbon offsets approved offsets are checked against a 40-point checklist56 to ensure they meet the very highest standards in the world on 17 july 2012 the first organisations were approved as meeting the new qas australian government national carbon offset programedit the australian government is currently in a consultation period on the regulation of carbon offsets57 on 20 december 2013 the australian government released the emissions reduction fund green paper outlining its preferred design options for the emissions reduction fund a carbon buy-back model the government invites public comment and written submissions on the green paper by 5pm on friday 21 february 2014.58 controversiesedit this articles criticism or controversy section may compromise the articles neutral point of view of the subject please integrate the sections contents into the article as a whole or rewrite the material may 2013 project-offsettingedit less than 30 pence in every pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes directly to projects designed to reduce emissions59 the figures reported by the bbc60 and based on un data reported that typically 28p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project 34p goes to the company that takes on the risk that the project may fail the projects investors take 19p with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits in that respect carbon offsets are similar to most consumer products with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off-shore producers the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas indulgence controversyedit some activists disagree with the principle of carbon offsets likening them to roman catholic indulgences a way for the guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior george monbiot an english environmentalist and writer says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution6162 proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions changing the business as usual and therefore address the root cause of climate change63 proponents of offsets claim that third-party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy energy efficiency methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projectscitation needed and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets on october 16 2009 responsibletravelcom once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting announced that it would stop offering carbon offsetting to its clients stating that too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries global reduction targets will not be met this way64 on 4 february 2010 travel networking site vida loca travel announced that they would donate 5 per cent of profits to international medical corps as they feel that international aid can be more effective at cutting global warming in the long term than carbon offsetting citing the work of economist jeffrey sachs65 effectiveness of tree-planting offsetsedit some environmentalists have questioned the effectiveness of tree-planting projects for carbon offset purposes66 critics point to the following issues with tree planting projects timing trees reach maturity over a course of many decades project developers and offset retailers typically pay for the project and sell the promised reductions up-front a practice known as forward selling permanence it is difficult to guarantee the permanence of the forests which may be susceptible to clearing burning or mismanagement the well-publicized instance of the coldplay forest in which a forestry project supported by the british band coldplay resulted in a grove of dead mango trees illustrates the difficulties of guaranteeing the permanence of tree-planting offsets67 when discussing tree offsets forest campaigner jutta kill of european environmental group fern clarified the physical reality that carbon in trees is temporary trees can easily release carbon into the atmosphere through fire disease climatic changes natural decay and timber harvesting68 monocultures and invasive species in an effort to cut costs some tree-planting projects introduce fast-growing invasive species that end up damaging native forests and reducing biodiversity for example in ecuador the dutch face foundation has an offset project in the andean pramo involving 220 square kilometres of eucalyptus and pine planted the ngo accin ecolgica criticized the project for destroying a valuable pramo ecosystem by introducing exotic tree species causing the release of much soil carbon into the atmosphere and harming local communities who had entered into contracts with the face foundation to plant the trees69 however some certification standards such as the climate community and biodiversity standard require multiple species plantings methane a recent study has claimed that plants are a significant source of methane a potent greenhouse gas raising the possibility that trees and other terrestrial plants may be significant contributors to global methane levels in the atmosphere70 however this claim has been disputed recently by findings in another study71 the albedo effect another study suggested that high latitude forests probably have a net warming effect on the earths climate because their absorption of sunlight creates a warming effect that balances out their absorption of carbon dioxide72 necessity corporate tree-planting is not a new idea farming operations have been used by companies making paper from trees for a long time if farmed trees are replanted and the products made from them are placed into landfills rather than recycled a very safe efficient economical and time-proven method of geological sequestration of greenhouse carbon is the result of the paper product use cycle this only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted in most landfills this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissionscitation needed indigenous land rights issuesedit tree-planting projects can cause conflicts with indigenous people who are displaced or otherwise find their use of forest resources curtailed for example a world rainforest movement report73 documents land disputes and human rights abuses at mount elgon in march 2002 a few days before receiving forest stewardship council certification for a project near mount elgon the uganda wildlife authority evicted more than 300 families from the area and destroyed their homes and crops that the project was taking place in an area of on-going land conflict and alleged human rights abuses did not make it into project reportcitation needed a 2011 report by oxfam international describes a case where over 20,000 farmers in uganda were displaced for a fsc-certified plantation to offset carbon by london-based new forests company74 additionality and lack of regulation in the voluntary marketedit several certification standards exist offering variations for measuring emissions baseline reductions additionality and other key criteria however no single standard governs the industry and some offset providers have been criticized on the grounds that carbon reduction claims are exaggerated or misleading problems include757677 widespread instances of people and organizations buying worthless credits that do not yield any reductions in carbon emissions industrial companies profiting from doing very little or from gaining carbon credits on the basis of efficiency gains from which they have already benefited substantially brokers providing services of questionable or no value a shortage of verification making it difficult for buyers to assess the true value of carbon credits perverse incentivesedit because offsets provide a revenue stream for the reduction of some types of emissions they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline this is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin for example one chinese company generated 500 million in carbon offsets by installing a 5million incinerator to burn the hfcs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants the huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely for the purpose of increasing production of hfcs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse7879 the practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy hfc-2380 in nigeria oil companies flare off 40 per cent of the natural gas found the agip oil company plans to build plants to generate electricity from this gas and thus claim 1.5 million offset credits a year united states company pan ocean oil corporation has also applied for credits in exchange for processing its own waste gas in nigeria oilwatchorgs michael karikpo calls this outrageous as flaring is illegal in nigeria adding that its like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes80 other negative impacts from offset projectsedit although many carbon offset projects tout their environmental co-benefits some are accused of having negative secondary effects point carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro-electric projects as carbon offsets some countries in the eu are not allowing large projects into the eu ets because of their environmental impacts even though they have been individually approved by the unfccc and world commission on dams81 it is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given the fact that they are a relatively new form of carbon reduction and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions82 offset projects may also have negative social impacts for example when local residents are evicted to enable a national park to be marketed as a carbon offset83 see alsoedit renewable energy portal energy portal global warming portal ecology portal environment portal carbon
