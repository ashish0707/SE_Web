volatile organic compounds vocs are organic chemicals that have a high vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature their high vapor pressure results from a low boiling point which causes large numbers of molecules to evaporate or sublimate from the liquid or solid form of the compound and enter the surrounding air a trait known as volatility for example formaldehyde which evaporates from paint has a boiling point of only 19c 2f vocs are numerous varied and ubiquitous they include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds most scents or odors are of vocs vocs play an important role in communication between plants1 and messages from plants to animals some vocs are dangerous to human health or cause harm to the environment anthropogenic vocs are regulated by law especially indoors where concentrations are the highest harmful vocs typically are not acutely toxic but have compounding long-term health effects because the concentrations are usually low and the symptoms slow to develop research into vocs and their effects is difficult contents 1 definitions 1.1 canada 1.2 european union 1.3 united states 2 biologically generated vocs 3 anthropogenic sources 3.1 specific

voc are in use2 the definitions of vocs used for control of precursors of photochemical smog used by the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies in the us with independent outdoor air pollution regulations include exemptions for vocs that are determined to be non-reactive or of low-reactivity in the smog formation process in the us regulatory requirements for vocs vary among the states most prominent is the voc regulation issued by the south coast air quality management district in california and by the california air resources board arb3 however this specific use of the term vocs can be misleading especially when applied to indoor air quality because many chemicals that are not regulated as outdoor air pollution can still be important for indoor air pollution californias arb uses the term reactive organic gases rog to measure organic gases after public hearing in september 1995 the arb revised the definition of volatile organic compounds used in the consumer products regulations based on their committees findings4 canadaedit health canada classes vocs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 to 250c 122 to 482f the emphasis is placed on commonly encountered vocs that would have an effect on air quality5 european unionedit the european union defines a voc as any organic compound having an initial boiling point less than or equal to 250c 482f measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kpa the voc solvents emissions directive is the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs in the european union it covers a wide range of solvent using activities eg printing surface cleaning vehicle coating dry cleaning and manufacture of footwear and pharmaceutical products the voc solvents emissions directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme6 united statesedit thermal oxidizers provide an air pollution abatement option for vocs from industrial air flows7 vocs or specific subsets of the vocs are legally defined in the various laws and codes under which they are regulated other definitions may be found from government agencies investigating or advising about vocs8 epa regulates vocs in the air water and land the federal regulations issued under the safe drinking water act list several organic compounds9 epa also publishes testing methods for chemical compounds including a range of vocs10 in addition to drinking water vocs are regulated in pollutant discharges to surface waters both directly and via sewage treatment plants11 as hazardous waste12 but not in non-industrial indoor air13 the occupational safety and health administration osha regulates voc exposure in the workplace volatile organic compounds that are classifed as hazardous materials are regulated by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration while being transported biologically generated vocsedit not counting methane biological sources emit an estimated 1150 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs14 the majority of vocs are produced by plants the main compound being isoprene the remainder are produced by animals microbes and fungi such as molds the strong odor emitted by many plants consists of green leaf volatiles a subset of vocs emissions are affected by a variety of factors such as temperature which determines rates of volatilization and growth and sunlight which determines rates of biosynthesis emission occurs almost exclusively from the leaves the stomata in particular a major class of vocs is terpenes such as myrcene15 providing a sense of scale a forest 62,000km2 in area the us state of pennsylvania is estimated to emit 3,400,000 kilograms of terpenes on a typical august day during the growing season16 vocs should be a factor in choosing which trees to plant in urban areas17 induction of genes producing volatile organic compounds and subsequent increase in volatile terpenes has been achieved in maize using z-3-hexen-1-ol and other plant hormones18 anthropogenic sourcesedit anthropogenic sources emit about 142 teragrams of carbon per year in the form of vocs14 specific componentsedit paints and coatingsedit a major source of man-made vocs are coatings especially paints and protective coatings solvents are required to spread a protective or decorative film approximately 12 billion litres of paints are produced annually typical solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons ethyl acetate glycol ethers and acetone motivated by cost environmental concerns and regulation the paint and coating industries are increasingly shifting toward aqueous solvents19 chlorofluorocarbons and chlorocarbonsedit chlorofluorocarbons which are banned or highly regulated were widely used cleaning products and refrigerants tetrachloroethene is used widely in dry cleaning and by industry fossil fuelsedit the use of fossil fuels produces vocs either directly as products eg gasoline or indirectly as byproducts eg automobile exhaust gascitation needed benzeneedit main article benzene one voc that is a known human carcinogen is benzene which is a chemical found in environmental tobacco smoke stored fuels and exhaust from cars benzene also has natural sources such as volcanoes and forest fires it is frequently used to make other chemicals in the production of plastics resins and synthetic fibers benzene evaporates into the air quickly and the vapor of benzene is heavier than air allowing the compound to sink into low-lying areas benzene has also been known to contaminate food and water and if digested can lead to vomiting dizziness sleepiness rapid heartbeat and at high levels even death may occurcitation needed methylene chlorideedit methylene chloride can be found in adhesive removers and aerosol spray paints in the human body methylene chloride is metabolized to carbon monoxide if a product that contains methylene chloride needs to be used the best way to protect human health is to use the product outdoors if it must be used indoors proper ventilation is will help to keep exposure levels downcitation needed in the united states methylene chloride is listed as exempt from voc status20 perchloroethyleneedit perchloroethylene is a volatile organic compound that has been linked to causing cancer in animals it is also suspected to cause many of the breathing related symptoms of exposure to vocscitation needed perchloroethylene is used mostly in dry cleaning while dry cleaners recapture perchloroethylene in the dry cleaning process to reuse it some environmental release is unavoidable mtbeedit mtbe was banned in certain states within the us around 2004 in order to limit further contamination of drinking water aquifers groundwater primarily from leaking underground gasoline storage tanks where mtbe was used as an octane booster and oxygenated-additivecitation needed formaldehydeedit many building materials such as paints adhesives wall boards and ceiling tiles slowly emit formaldehyde which irritates the mucous membranes and can make a person irritated and uncomfortable21 formaldehyde emissions from wood are in the range of 0.020.04 ppm relative humidity within an indoor environment can also affect the emissions of formaldehyde high relative humidity and high temperatures allow more vaporization of formaldehyde from wood-materials22 indoor airedit main article indoor air quality since many people spend much of their time indoors long-term exposure to vocs in the indoor environment can contribute to sick building syndrome23 in offices voc results from new furnishings wall coverings and office equipment such as photocopy machines which can off-gas vocs into the air24 good ventilation and air-conditioning systems are helpful at reducing vocs in the indoor environment24 studies also show that relative leukemia and lymphoma can increase through prolonged exposure of vocs in the indoor environment25 in the united states there are two standardized methods for measuring vocs one by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh and another by osha each method uses a single component solvent butanol and hexane cannot be sampled however on the same sample matrix using the niosh or osha method26 the aromatic voc compound benzene emitted from exhaled cigarette smoke is labeled as carcinogenic and is ten times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers27 epa has found concentrations of vocs in indoor air to be 2 to 5 times greater than in outdoor air and sometimes far greater13 during certain activities indoor levels of vocs may reach 1,000 times that of the outside air studies have shown that individual voc emissions by themselves are not that high in an indoor environment but the indoor total voc tvoc concentrations can be up to five times higher than the voc outdoor levels28 new buildings especially contribute to the highest level of voc off-gassing in an indoor environment because of the abundant new materials generating voc particles at the same time in such a short time period23 in addition to new buildings we also use many consumer products that emit voc compounds therefore the total concentration of voc levels is much greater within the indoor environment23 voc concentration in an indoor environment during winter is three to four times higher than the voc concentrations during the summer29 high indoor voc levels are attributed to the low rates of air exchange between the indoor and outdoor environment as a result of tight-shut windows and the increasing use of humidifiers30 indoor air quality measurementsedit measurement of vocs from the indoor air is done with sorption tubes e g tenax for vocs and svocs or dnph-cartridges for carbonyl-compounds the vocs adsorb on these materials and are afterwards desorbed either thermally tenax or by elution dnph and then analyzed by gc-msfid or hplc reference gas mixtures are required for quality control of these voc-measurements31 furthermore voc emitting products used indoors e g building products and furniture are investigated in emission test chambers under controlled climatic conditions32 for quality control of these measurements round robin tests are carried out therefore reproducibly emitting reference materials are ideally required31 regulation of indoor voc emissionsedit in most countries a separate definition of vocs is used with regard to indoor air quality that comprises each organic chemical compound that can be measured as follows adsorption from air on tenax ta thermal desorption gas chromatographic separation over a 100 nonpolar column dimethylpolysiloxane voc volatile organic compounds are all compounds that appear in the gas chromatogram between and including n-hexane and n-hexadecane compounds appearing earlier are called vvoc very volatile organic compounds compounds appearing later are called svoc semi-volatile organic compounds see also these standards iso 16000-6 iso 13999-2 vdi 4300-6 german agbb evaluating scheme german dibt approval scheme gev testing method for the emicode some overviews over voc emissions rating schemes33 have been collected and compared france germany and belgium have enacted regulations to limit voc emissions from commercial products and industry has developed numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems such as emicode34 m135 blue angel36 and indoor air comfort37 in the united states several standards exist california standard cdph section 0135038 is the most popular one over the last few decades these regulations and standards changed the marketplace leading to an increasing number of low-emitting products the leading voluntary labels report that licenses to several hundreds of low-emitting products have been issued see the respective webpages such as mas certified green- certified products39 health risksedit respiratory allergic or immune effects in infants or children are associated with man-made vocs and other indoor or outdoor air pollutants40 some vocs such as styrene and limonene can react with nitrogen oxides or with ozone to produce new oxidation products and secondary aerosols which can cause sensory irritation symptoms41 unspecified vocs are important in the creation of smog42 health effects include eye nose and throat irritation headaches loss of coordination nausea and damage to the liver kidney and central nervous system some organics can cause cancer in animals some are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans key signs or symptoms associated with exposure to vocs include conjunctival irritation nose and throat discomfort headache allergic skin reaction dyspnea declines in serum cholinesterase levels nausea vomiting nose bleeding fatigue dizzinesscitation needed the ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly from those that are highly toxic to those with no known health effects as with other pollutants the extent and nature of the health effect will depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed eye and respiratory tract irritation headaches dizziness visual disorders and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people have experienced soon after exposure to some organics at present not much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics usually found in homes many organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals some are suspected of causing or are known to cause cancer in humans43 reducing exposureedit to reduce exposure to these toxins one should buy products that contain low-vocs or no vocs only the quantity which will soon be needed should be purchased eliminating stockpiling of these chemicals use products with vocs in well ventilated areas when designing homes and buildings design teams can implement the best possible ventilation plans call for the best mechanical systems available and design assemblies to reduce the amount of infiltration into the building these methods will help improve indoor air quality but by themselves they cannot keep a building from becoming an unhealthy place to breathecitation needed limit values for voc emissionsedit limit values for voc emissions into indoor air are published by eg agbb afsset california department of public health and others these regulations have prompted several companies to adapt with voc level reductions in products that have vocs in their formula such as behr kilz and benjamin moore co in the paint industry and weld-on in the adhesive industrycitation needed chemical fingerprintingedit the exhaled human breath contains a few hundred volatile organic compounds and is used in breath analysis to serve as a voc biomarker to test for diseases such as lung cancer44 one study has shown that volatile organic compounds  are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body45 and it appears that voc compounds in the body may be either produced by metabolic processes or inhaledabsorbed from exogenous sources such as environmental tobacco smoke4446 research is still in the process to determine whether vocs in the body are contributed by cellular processes or by the cancerous tumors in the lung or other organs voc sensorsedit main article voc sensors principle and measurement methodsedit vocs in the environment or certain atmospheres can be detected based on different principles and interactions between the organic compounds and the sensor components there are electronic devices that can detect ppm concentrations despite the non-selectivity others can predict with reasonable accuracy the molecular structure of the volatile organic compounds in the environment or enclosed atmospheres47 and could be used as accurate monitors of the chemical fingerprint and further as health monitoring devices solid-phase microextraction spme techniques are used to collect vocs at low concentrations for analysis48 direct injection mass spectrometry techniques are frequently utilized for the rapid detection and accurate quantification of vocs49 ptr-ms is among the methods that have been used most extensively for the on-line analysis of biogenic and antropogenic vocs50 recent ptr-ms instruments based on time-of-flight mass spectrometry have been reported to reach detection limits of 20 pptv after 100 ms and 750 ppqv after 1 min measurement signal integration time the mass resolution of these devices is between 7000 and 10,500 mm thus it is possible to separate most common isobaric vocs and quantify them independently51 accuracy and traceabilityedit metrology for voc measurementsedit to achieve comparability of voc measurements reference standards traceable to si-units are required for a number of vocs gaseous reference standards are available from specialty gas suppliers or national metrology institutes either in the form of cylinders or dynamic generation methods however for many vocs such as oxygenated vocs monoterpenes or formaldehyde no standards are available at the appropriate amount of fraction due to the chemical reactivity or adsorption of these molecules currently several national metrology institutes are working on the lacking standard gas mixtures at trace level concentration minimising adsorption processes and improving the zero gas31 the final scopes are for the traceability and the long-term stability of the standard gases to be in accordance with the data quality objectives dqo maximum uncertainty of 20 in this case required by the wmogaw program52 see alsoedit aroma compound criteria
