scandinavia always includes the mainlands of the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden norwegian dependencies including svalbard and jan mayen are usually not seen as a part of scandinavia nor is danish greenland however the danish faroe islands are sometimes included as sometimes are iceland and finland because of their historical association with the scandinavian countries and the scandinavian peoples and languages2 this looser definition almost equates to that of the nordic countries in nordic languages only mainland denmark norway and sweden are commonly included in the definition of scandinavia in english usage scandinavia sometimes refers to the geographical area also known as the scandinavian peninsula34 the name scandinavia originally referred vaguely to the formerly danish now swedish region scania the terms scandinavia and scandinavian entered usage in the late 18th century as terms for denmark norway and sweden their germanic majority peoples and associated language and culture the term being introduced by the early linguistic and cultural scandinavist movement the majority of the population of scandinavia are descended from several north germanic tribes who originally inhabited the southern part of scandinavia and spoke a germanic language that evolved into old norse icelanders and the faroese are to a significant extent descended from the norse and are therefore often seen as scandinavian finland is mainly populated by finns with a significant minority of swedish speakers a small minority of sami people live in the extreme north of scandinavia the danish norwegian and swedish languages form a dialect continuum and are known as the scandinavian languagesall of which are considered mutually intelligible with one another faroese and icelandic sometimes referred to as insular scandinavian languages are intelligible in continental scandinavian languages only to a limited extent finnish and menkieli are closely related to each other and more distantly to the sami languages but are entirely unrelated to the scandinavian languages apart from these german yiddish and romani are recognized minority languages in scandinavia the southern and by far most populous regions of scandinavia have a temperate climate scandinavia extends north of the arctic circle but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the gulf stream much of the scandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate there are many lakes and moraines legacies of the last glacial period which ended about ten millennia ago contents 1

see also 9 notes 10 references 11 external links terminology and useedit satellite photo of the scandinavian peninsula march 2002 scandinavia originally referred vaguely to scania a formerly danish region that became swedish in the 17th century scandinavia usually refers to denmark norway and sweden5 some sources argue for the inclusion of the faroe islands finland and iceland26789 though that broader region is usually known by the countries concerned as norden finnish pohjoismaat icelandic norurlndin faroese norurlond or the nordic countries10 the three monarchies denmark norway and sweden that compose scandinavia according to the normal definition the extended usage in english iceland and the faroe islands on account of their populations being largely descended from scandinavians the land islands for its ethnic swedish population finland on account of its historical association with sweden and its swedish minority the use of the name scandinavia as a convenient general term for the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden is fairly recent according to some historians it was adopted and introduced in the eighteenth century at a time when the ideas about a common heritage started to appear and develop into early literary and linguistic scandinavism4 before this time the term scandinavia was familiar mainly to classical scholars through pliny the elders writings and was used vaguely for scania and the southern region of the peninsula4 as a political term scandinavia was first used by students agitating for pan-scandinavianism in the 1830s.4 the popular usage of the term in sweden denmark and norway as a unifying concept became established in the nineteenth century through poems such as hans christian andersens i am a scandinavian of 1839 after a visit to sweden andersen became a supporter of early political scandinavism in a letter describing the poem to a friend he wrote all at once i understood how related the swedes the danes and the norwegians are and with this feeling i wrote the poem immediately after my return we are one people we are called scandinavians11 finlandedit the clearest example of the use of the term scandinavia as a political and societal construct is the unique position of finland based largely on the fact that most of modern-day finland was part of the swedish kingdom for hundreds of years thus to much of the world associating finland with all of scandinavia but the creation of a finnish identity is unique in the region in that it was formed in relation to two different imperial models the swedish12 and the russian1314 as described by the university of jyvskyl based editorial board of the finnish journal yearbook of political thought and conceptual history15 the term is often defined according to the conventions of the cultures that lay claim to the term in their own use16 when a speaker wants to explicitly include finland alongside scandinavia-proper the geographic terms fenno-scandinavia or fennoscandia are sometimes used in english although these terms are hardly if at all used within scandinavia more precisely and subject to no dispute is that finland is included in the broader term nordic countries societal and tourism promotional organizationsedit various promotional agencies of the nordic countries in the united states such as the american-scandinavian foundation established in 1910 by the danish american industrialist niels poulsen serve to promote market and tourism interests in the region today the five nordic heads of state act as the organizations patrons and according to the official statement by the organization its mission is to promote the nordic region as a whole while increasing the visibility of denmark finland iceland norway and sweden in new york city and the united states17 the official tourist boards of scandinavia sometimes cooperate under one umbrella such as the scandinavian tourist board18 the cooperation was introduced for the asian market in 1986 when the swedish national tourist board joined the danish national tourist board to coordinate intergovernmental promotion of the two countries norways government entered one year later all five nordic governments participate in the joint promotional efforts in the united states through the scandinavian tourist board of north america19 use of nordic countries vs scandinaviaedit for more details on this terminology see nordic countries while the term scandinavia is commonly used for denmark norway and sweden the term the nordic countries is used unambiguously for denmark norway sweden finland and iceland including their associated territories greenland the faroe islands and the land islands20 scandinavia can thus be considered a subset of the nordic countries furthermore the term fennoscandia refers to scandinavia finland and karelia excluding denmark and overseas territories however the usage of this term is restricted to geology when speaking of the fennoscandian shield baltic shield in addition to the mainland scandinavian countries of denmark constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system norway constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system independent since 1905 sweden ceremonial monarchy with a parliamentary system the nordic countries also consist of finland parliamentary republic independent since 1917 iceland parliamentary republic independent since 1944 land islands an autonomous province of finland since 1920 faroe islands an autonomous country within the danish realm self-governed since 1948 greenland an autonomous country within the danish realm self-governed since 1979 svalbard which is under norwegian sovereignty is not considered part of scandinavia as a cultural-historical region but as a part of the kingdom of norway since 1925 it is part of the nordic countries norden estonia has applied for membership in the nordic council referring to its cultural heritage and close linguistic links to finland and historical connections to both denmark and sweden although normally estonia is regarded as one of the baltic countries it is similar to the situation of finland around the 1920s as finland was considered to be one of the baltic states as wellcitation needed as it too had emerged from russian domination along with the other three countries under similar circumstances while finnish and estonian are finnic languages latvian and lithuanian are baltic languages it should be noted that whereas the term scandinavia is relatively straightforward as traditionally relating to the three kingdoms of denmark norway and sweden there exists some ambiguity as regards the ethnic aspect of the concept in the modern era traditionally the term refers specifically to the majority peoples of denmark norway and sweden their states their germanic languages and their culture in the modern era the term will often include minority peoples such as the sami and menkieli speakers in a political and to some extent cultural sense as they are citizens of scandinavian countries and speak scandinavian languages either as their first or second language however scandinavian is still also seen as an ethnic term for the germanic majority peoples of scandinavia and as such the inclusion of sami and finnish speakers can be seen as controversial within these groups etymologyedit the original areas inhabited during the bronze age by the peoples since known as scandinavians included what is now northern germany particularly schleswig-holstein all of denmark southern sweden and the southern coast of norway namesake scania found itself in the centre late baltic ice lake around 10,300 years bp with a channel near mount billingen through what is now central sweden political boundaries added scandinavia and scania skne the southernmost province of sweden are considered to have the same etymology both terms are thought to go back to the proto-germanic compound skain-awj which appears later in old english as scedenig and in old norse as skney21 the earliest identified source for the name scandinavia is pliny the elders natural history dated to the first century ad various references to the region can also be found in pytheas pomponius mela tacitus ptolemy procopius and jordanes usually in the form of scandza it is believed that the name used by pliny may be of west germanic origin originally denoting scania22 according to some scholars the germanic stem can be reconstructed as skaan- meaning danger or damage english scathing german schaden dutch schade23 the second segment of the name has been reconstructed as awj meaning land on the water or island the name scandinavia would then mean dangerous island which is considered to refer to the treacherous sandbanks surrounding scania23 skanr in scania with its long falsterbo reef has the same stem skan combined with -r which means sandbanks in the reconstructed germanic root skain-awj the edh represented in latin by t or d the first segment is sometimes considered more uncertain than the second segment the american heritage dictionary24 derives the second segment from proto-indo-european akwa- water in the sense of watery land the old norse goddess name skai along with scandinavia and skney may be related to gothic skadus old english sceadu old saxon scado and old high german scato meaning shadow scholar john mckinnell comments that this etymology suggests that the goddess skai may have once been a personification of the geographical region of scandinavia or associated with the underworld25 pliny the elders descriptionsedit plinys descriptions of scatinavia and surrounding areas are not always easy to decipher writing in the capacity of a roman admiral he introduces the northern region by declaring to his roman readers that there are 23 islands romanis armis cognitae known to roman arms in this area according to pliny the clarissima most famous of the regions islands is scatinavia of unknown size there live the hilleviones the belief that scandinavia was an island became widespread among classical authors during the first century and dominated descriptions of scandinavia in classical texts during the centuries that followed pliny begins his description of the route to scatinavia by referring to the mountain of saevo mons saevo ibi the codanus bay codanus sinus and the cimbrian promontory26 the geographical features have been identified in various ways by some scholars saevo is thought to be the mountainous norwegian coast at the entrance to skagerrak and the cimbrian peninsula is thought to be skagen the north tip of jutland denmark as described saevo and scatinavia can also be the same place pliny mentions scandinavia one more time in book viii he says that the animal called achlis given in the accusative achlin which is not latin was born on the island of scandinavia27 the animal grazes has a big upper lip and some mythical attributes the name scandia later used as a synonym for scandinavia also appears in plinys naturalis historia but is used for a group of northern european islands which he locates north of britannia scandia thus does not appear to be denoting the island scadinavia in plinys text the idea that scadinavia may have been one of the scandiae islands was instead introduced by ptolemy c 90 c 168ad a mathematician geographer and astrologer of roman egypt he used the name skandia for the biggest most easterly of the three scandiai islands which according to him were all located east of jutland23 neither plinys nor ptolemys lists of scandinavian tribes include the suiones mentioned by tacitus some early swedish scholars of the swedish hyperborean school28 and of the 19th-century romantic nationalism period proceeded to synthesize the different versions by inserting references to the suiones arguing that they must have been referred to in the original texts and obscured over time by spelling mistakes or various alterations2930 germanic reconstructionedit the latin names in plinys text gave rise to different forms in medieval germanic texts in jordanes history of the goths ad 551 the form scandza is the name used for their original home separated by sea from the land of europe chapter 1 4.31 where jordanes meant to locate this quasi-legendary island is still a hotly debated issue both in scholarly discussions and in the nationalistic discourse of various european countries3233 the form scadinavia as the original home of the langobards appears in paulus diaconus historia langobardorum34 in other versions of historia langobardorum appear the forms scadan scandanan scadanan and scatenauge35 frankish sources used sconaowe and aethelweard an anglo-saxon historian used scani3637 in beowulf the forms scedenige and scedeland are used while the alfredian translation of orosius and wulfstans travel accounts used the old english sconeg37 sami etymologyedit kautokeino the main sami city in norway the earliest sami yoik texts written down refer to the world as skadesi-suolo north-sami and skasul east-sami meaning skais island svennung 1963 svennung considers the sami name to have been introduced as a loan word from the north germanic languages38 skai is the giant stepmother of freyr and freyja in norse mythology it has been suggested that skai to some extent is modeled on a sami woman the name for skades father thjazi is known in sami as hci the waterman and her son with odin saeming can be interpreted as a descendent of saam the sami population mundel 2000,39 steinsland 1991.40 older joik texts give evidence of the old sami belief about living on an island and state that the wolf is known as suolu gievra meaning the strong one on the island the sami place name sulliidielbma means the islands threshold and suoloielgi means the islands back in recent substrate studies sami linguists have examined the initial cluster sk- in words used in sami and concluded that sk- is a phonotactic structure of alien origin41 other etymologiesedit another possibility is that all or part of the segments of the name came from the mesolithic people inhabiting the region42 in modernity scandinavia is a peninsula but between approximately 10,300 and 9,500 years ago the southern part of scandinavia was an island separated from the northern peninsula with water exiting the baltic sea through the area where stockholm is now located43 some basque scholars have presented the idea that the segment sk that appears in skainawj is connected to the name for the euzko peoples akin to basques that populated paleolithic europe according to some of these intellects scandinavian people share particular genetic markers with the basque people42 geographyedit galdhpiggen is the highest point in scandinavia and is a part of the scandinavian mountains see also geography of denmark geography of finland geography of iceland geography of norway and geography of sweden the geography of scandinavia is extremely varied notable are the norwegian fjords the scandinavian mountains the flat low areas in denmark and the archipelagos of sweden and norway sweden has many lakes and moraines legacies of the ice age the climate varies from north to south and from west to east a marine west coast climate cfb typical of western europe dominates in denmark southernmost part of sweden and along the west coast of norway reaching north to 65n with orographic lift giving more mmyear precipitation 5000mm in some areas in western norway the central part from oslo to stockholm has a humid continental climate dfb which gradually gives way to subarctic climate dfc further north and cool marine west coast climate cfc along the northwestern coast a small area along the northern coast east of the north cape has tundra climate et as a result of a lack of summer warmth the scandinavian mountains block the mild and moist air coming from the southwest thus northern sweden and the finnmarksvidda plateau in norway receive little precipitation and have cold winters large areas in the scandinavian mountains have alpine tundra climate the warmest temperature ever recorded in scandinavia is 38.0c in mlilla sweden44 the coldest temperature ever recorded is 52.6c in vuoggatjlme sweden45 the coldest month was february 1985 in vittangi sweden with a mean of 27.2c.45

following minority languages in scandinavia are protected under the european charter for regional or minority languages yiddish romani chib romanes and romani north germanic languagesedit main article north germanic languages continental scandinavian languages danish norwegian swedish insular scandinavian languages faroese icelandic the north germanic languages of scandinavia are traditionally divided into an east scandinavian branch danish and swedish and a west scandinavian branch norwegian icelandic and faroese4748 but because of changes appearing in the languages since 1600 the east scandinavian and west scandinavian branches are now usually reconfigured into insular scandinavian -nordisky-nordisk featuring icelandic and faroese49 and continental scandinavian skandinavisk comprising danish norwegian and swedish50 the modern division is based on the degree of mutual comprehensibility between the languages in the two branches51 the populations of the scandinavian countries with a scandinavian mother tongue canat least with some trainingunderstand each others standard languages as they appear in print and are heard on radio and television the reason danish swedish and the two official written versions of norwegian nynorsk and bokml are traditionally viewed as different languages rather than dialects of one common language is that each is a well-established standard language in its respective country danish swedish and norwegian have since medieval times been influenced to varying degrees by middle low german and standard german a substantial amount of that influence was a by-product of the economic activity generated by the hanseatic league norwegians are accustomed to variation and may perceive danish and swedish only as slightly more distant dialects this is because they have two official written standards in addition to the habit of strongly holding on to local dialects the people of stockholm sweden and copenhagen denmark have the greatest difficulty in understanding other scandinavian languages52 in the faroe islands and iceland learning danish is mandatory this causes faroese people as well as icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct north germanic languages making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two mainland scandinavian languages5354 although iceland was under the political control of denmark until a much later date 1918 very little influence and borrowing from danish has occurred in the icelandic language55 icelandic remained the preferred language among the ruling classes in iceland danish was not used for official communications most of the royal officials were of icelandic descent and the language of the church and law courts remained icelandic56 finnishedit the scandinavian languages are as a language family entirely unrelated to finnish estonian and sami languages which as uralic languages are distantly related to hungarian owing to the close proximity there is still a great deal of borrowing from the swedish and norwegian languages in the finnish and sami languages57 the long history of linguistic influence of swedish on finnish is also due to the fact that finnish the language of the majority in finland was treated as a minority language while finland was part of sweden finnish-speakers had to learn swedish in order to advance to higher positions58 swedish spoken in todays finland includes a lot of words that are borrowed from finnish whereas the written language remains closer to that of sweden finland is officially bilingual with finnish and swedish having mostly the same status at national level finlands majority population are finns whose mother tongue is either finnish approximately 95 swedish or both the swedish speaking minority lives mainly on the coast from the city of porvoo in the gulf of finland to the city of kokkola up in the bothnian bay the land islands an autonomous province of finland situated in the baltic sea between finland and sweden is entirely swedish speaking children are taught the other official language at school for swedish-speakers this is finnish usually from the 3rd grade and for finnish-speakers swedish usually from the 3rd 5th or 7th grade finnish speakers constitute a language minority in sweden and norway there are also languages derived from finnish having evolved separately known as menkieli in sweden and kven in norway sami languagesedit historically verified distribution of the sami languageslegend the sami languages are indigenous minority languages in scandinavia59 they belong to their own branch of the uralic language family and are unrelated to the north germanic languages other than by limited grammatical particularly lexical characteristics resulting from prolonged contact57 sami is divided into several languages or dialects60 consonant gradation is a feature in both finnish and northern sami dialects but it is not present in south sami which is considered to have a different language history according to the sami information centre of the sami parliament in sweden southern sami may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the scandinavian peninsula57 historyedit for a more in-depth look at the history of the region see history of scandinavia the area of sweden when finland was a part of it from ca 1249 until 1809 during a period of christianization and state formation in the 10th13th centuries numerous germanic petty kingdoms and chiefdoms were unified into three kingdoms denmark forged from the lands of denmark including jutland zealand and scania skneland on the scandinavian peninsula61 sweden forged from the lands of sweden on the scandinavian peninsula excluding the provinces bohusln hrjedalen jmtland and idre srna halland blekinge and scania of modern-day sweden but including most of modern finland norway including bohusln hrjedalen jmtland and idre srna on the scandinavian peninsula and

margaret i of denmark sweden left the union in 1523 under king gustav vasa in the aftermath of swedens secession from the kalmar union civil war broke out in denmark and norway the protestant reformation followed when things had settled the norwegian privy council was abolishedit assembled for the last time in 1537 a personal union entered into by the kingdoms of denmark and norway in 1536 lasted until 1814 three sovereign successor states have subsequently emerged from this unequal union denmark norway and iceland the borders between the three countries got the shape they have had since in the middle of the seventeenth century in the 1645 treaty of brmsebro denmarknorway ceded the norwegian provinces of jmtland hrjedalen and idre srna as well as the baltic sea islands of gotland and sel in estonia to sweden the treaty of roskilde signed in 1658 forced denmarknorway to cede the danish provinces scania blekinge halland bornholm and the norwegian provinces of bhuslen and trndelag to sweden the 1660 treaty of copenhagen forced sweden to return bornholm and trndelag to denmarknorway and to give up its recent claims to the island funen62 in the east finland was a fully incorporated part of sweden since medieval times until the napoleonic wars when it was ceded to russia scandinavia has despite many wars over the years since the formation of the three kingdoms been

norwegian dependencies of iceland greenland and the faroe islands the corresponding adjective and demonym is dano-norwegian during danish rule norway kept its separate laws coinage and army as well as some institutions such as a royal chancellor norways old royal line had died out with the death of olav iv63 in 1387 but norways remaining a hereditary kingdom became an important factor for the oldenburg dynasty of denmarknorway in its struggles to win elections as kings of denmark the treaty of kiel 14 january 1814 formally dissolved the dano-norwegian union and ceded the territory of norway proper to the king of sweden but denmark retained norways overseas possessions however widespread norwegian resistance to the prospect of a union with sweden induced the governor of norway crown prince christian frederick later christian viii of denmark to call a constituent assembly at eidsvoll in april 1814 the assembly drew up a liberal constitution and elected christian frederick to the throne of norway following a swedish invasion during the summer the peace conditions of the convention of moss 14 august 1814 specified that king christian frederik had to resign but norway would keep its independence and its constitution within a personal union with sweden christian frederik formally abdicated on 10 august 1814 and returned to denmark the norwegian parliament storting elected king charles xiii of sweden as king of norway on 4 november the storting dissolved the union between sweden and norway in 1905 after which the norwegians elected prince charles of denmark as king of

modern use of the term scandinavia has been influenced by scandinavism the scandinavist political movement which was active in the middle of the nineteenth century mainly between the first schleswig war 18481850 in which sweden and norway contributed with considerable military force and the second schleswig war 1864 the swedish king also proposed a unification of denmark norway and sweden into a single united kingdom the background for the proposal was the tumultuous events during the napoleonic wars in the beginning of the century this war resulted in finland formerly the eastern third of sweden becoming the russian grand duchy of finland in 1809 and norway de jure in union with denmark since 1387 although de facto treated as a province becoming independent in 1814 but thereafter swiftly forced to accept a personal union with sweden the dependent territories iceland the faroe islands and greenland historically part of norway remained with denmark in accordance with the treaty of kiel sweden and norway were thus united under the swedish monarch but finlands inclusion in the russian empire excluded any possibility for a political union between finland and any of the other nordic countries the end of the scandinavian political movement came when denmark was denied the military support promised from sweden and norway to annex the danish duchy of schleswig which together with the german duchy of holstein had been in personal union with denmark the second war of schleswig followed in 1864 a brief but disastrous war between denmark and prussia supported by austria schleswig-holstein was conquered by prussia and after prussias success in the franco-prussian war a prussian-led german empire was created and a new power-balance of the baltic sea countries was established even if a scandinavian political union never came about at this point there was a scandinavian monetary union established in 1873 lasting until world war i see alsoedit baltic region
