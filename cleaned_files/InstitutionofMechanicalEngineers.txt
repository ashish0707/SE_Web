executive website wwwimecheorg the institution of mechanical engineers imeche is an independent engineering society headquartered in central london that represents mechanical engineers with over 113,000 members in 140 countries working across industries such as railway automotive aerospace manufacturing energy biomedical and construction the cinstitution is licensed by the engineering council engc to assess candidates for inclusion on its register of chartered engineers the institution was founded at the queens hotel birmingham by george stephenson in 1847 following an informal meeting at locomotive designer charles beyers house in cecil street manchester it received a royal charter in 1930 the institutions headquarters purpose-built for the institution in 1899 are situated at one birdcage walk london the first woman to be elected to the institution was verena holmes in 1919.citation needed contents 1 origins 2 one birdcage walk 3 membership grades and post-nominals 4 awards 5

the queens hotel next to curzon street railway station in birmingham by the railway pioneer george stephenson and others1 the founding of the institution is said to have been spurred by outrage that george stephenson the most famous mechanical engineer of the age had been refused admission to the institution of civil engineers unless he sent in a probationary essay as proof of his capacity as an engineer2 however this account has been challenged as an exaggeration though there was certainly coolness between stephenson and the institution of civil engineers it is more likely that the motivation behind the founding of the institution of mechanical engineers was simply the need for a specific home for the growing number of mechanical engineers employed in the burgeoning railway and manufacturing industries2 charles beyer proposed that george stephenson become the institutions first president in 1847,3 followed by his son robert stephenson in 1849 beyer became vice president and was one of the first to present papers to the institution4 charles geach was the imeches first treasurer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries some of britains most notable engineers held the position of president including joseph whitworth carl wilhelm siemens and sir harry ricardo it operated from premises in birmingham until 1877 when it moved to london taking up its present headquarters on birdcage walk in 1899.5 one birdcage walkedit one birdcage walk upon its move to london in 1877 the institution rented premises at no 10 victoria chambers where it remained for 20 years in 1895 the institution bought a plot of land at storeys gate on the eastern end of birdcage walk for 9,500.5 architect basil slade looked to the newly completed admiralty buildings facing the site for inspiration the building was designed in the queen anne streaky bacon style in red brick and portland stone inside there were several features that were state of the art for the time including a telephone a 54-inch fan in the lecture theatre for driving air into the building an electric lift from the otis elevator company and a synchronome master-clock which controlled all house timepieces in 1933 architect james miller who also designed the neighbouring institution of civil engineers remodelled the building expanding the library and introducing electric lighting the building would go on to host the first public presentation of frank whittles jet engine in 1945.6 in 1943 it became the venue for the royal electrical and mechanical engineers reme planning of operation overlord and the invasion of normandy5 today one birdcage walk hosts events lectures seminars and meetings in 17 conference and meeting rooms named after notable former members of the institution such
