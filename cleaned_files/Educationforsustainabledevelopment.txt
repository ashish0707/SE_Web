employees focused on sustainability education that includes the skill sets of efs25 sustainable development and education in ugandaedit from a political point of view you can say that the idea of sustainability comes from two different trends developed after the second world war which can be related to when colonial powers ended their occupation within the first trend it was noticed that the former colonies suffered from social and economical problems like poverty and lack of food the united nations therefore arranged several conferences where solutions to these problems were outlined several international organs were established including the international monetary fund imf and the world bank group wbg the second trend stars out from the alarming reports that began to appear during the 1960s which warned for humans way of using nature resources the resources would come to an end because of the future economical growth and increase in population a first attempt to discuss these trends could be seen during the united nations conference on the environment in stockholm 1972 as a result united nations development program undp was founded the first conference concerning environmental education ee was held in tblisi in 1977 and it resulted in the tblisi declaration the document focuses on ee and maintains among others that it should be interdisciplinary be a lifelong process and develop critical thinking and problem solving skills the declaration has had a large effect on curriculums for example in the uganda strategy to implementing education for sustainable development the term sustainable development got an international breakthrough in 1987 with the bruntland commissions final report our common future the definition of sustainable development was stated in this report and it is still ubiquitoussustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs sustainable development is about a global responsibility and solidarity between generations between women and men and between different cultures and countries it is about safeguarding and efficient use of existing nature resources investment in management of human social and physiological resources is also crucial parts of sustainable development democratic values permeate the society and the citizens feel that they can influence the development and that they have the will of taking that responsibility for doing so the principles underlying sustainable can be separated into a social economic and ecological dimension the economic growth is used to be seen as a requirement for development no country can achieve a sustainable economic growth if the environment is worsened if the prosperity is not fairly distributed and if growth of the human resources has not taken place therefore the economical dimension means that economical growth shall carry on with first respect taken to the environment second growth of the peoples health and education and third a fair distribution of prosperity the social dimension points out the importance resources power and influence are fairly distributed and that people can feel security and can participate the social dimension is therefore a requirement for economic growth the environment dimension means that considerations are taken for the social and economical development these three dimensions are integrated with each other as they are interdependent and mutually reinforcing the implication of this is that sustainable development to a large extent is about politics in 1992 a un conference also known as earth summit was held in rio de janeiro the most famous agreement from that meeting is the agenda 21 a plan of action for sustainable development two major differences from earlier conferences were a the large number of participating voluntary organizations and b the emphasis of the plan of action of the regional national and local cooperation to reach a sustainable development chapter 36 in agenda 21 brings up educational issues and it emphasizes the importance of orienting the education to achieve sustainable development26 education is critical for promoting sustainable development and improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues both formal and non-formal education are indispensable to changing peoples attitudes so that they have the capacity to assess and address their sustainable development concerns it is also critical for achieving environmental and ethical awareness values and attitudes skills and behavior consistent with sustainable development and for effective public participation in decision making in the year 2000 the united nations millennium declaration was adopted which emphasizes that a global development demands a comprehensive view the declaration formed the basis of time bound and measurable goals for development it contained eight goals that should promote a global development among them were goals for reduction of poverty reduction of infant mortality reduction of the hivaids malaria spreading and a sustainable development until 2015 education for sustainable development in germanyedit within the decade of education for sustainable development the field of esd in germany has expanded a lot there are broad school-networks and strong relationships between schools and out-of-school-education nevertheless estimations say that the concept only has reaches nearly 10 of the schools and many individual teachers all over the country esd and global education - in the past two different concepts - now work under the same headline global education in germany global learning is a special entry to esd which emphasises the relationships between north and south in a globalized world and discusses injustices between the different parts of the world partly with reference to the postcolonial discussion 1 the german education ministry has reached out a curriculum framework education for sustainable development which has to develop more activities in the school sector 2 referencesedit mckeown r 2002
