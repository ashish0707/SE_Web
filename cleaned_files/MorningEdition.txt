quarter-century his last day as host was april 30 20044 this was not due to edwards retiring but rather a highly controversial decision from npr to reassign him as senior correspondent which resulted

received the george foster peabody award11 formatedit the following describes the program format effective november 17 2014.12 morning edition begins each hour with a sixty-second billboard highlighting stories to be covered in the hour at least one birthday or anniversary of a major event is announced as well some stations replace this billboard with a localized version with a similar format but with emphasis on local stories and read by a local announcer the standard npr newscast follows for five minutes many stations cut into the newscast at04 past the hour to deliver additional news programming a sixty-second music bed follows allowing stations additional time to deliver news weather or funding credits after that the signature thirty-second bleeble music bed begins the program the first segment a highlights the most important stories of the day usually the a segments differ between hours although when the topic is extraordinary the a segment will cover the same topic but in a different format between the first and second hour between each segment one- to three-minute breaks occur which are filled with promotions for other programs sponsorship credits and station-provided content such as local traffic and weather reports segment a ends at eighteen minutes past the hour and a sixty-second break follows new to morning edition effective november 17 2014 is a 89-second newscast at19 and42 past the hour the mid-hour newscasts emphasize live news including question and answer with correspondents as opposed to headlines following each mid-hour newscast is a 90-second break to allow stations to provide local news and information13 returning from the break at 2230 past the hour the second segment or b segment generally contains features commentaries or long form interviews interviews can sometimes take up the entire segment segment b ends at 3000 past the hour at which point a promotion for all things considered and a humorous news item is delivered these segments are called returns because many stations that air local news or announcements return to the national feed at half past the hour the return lasts thirty seconds and ends with the tagline its morning edition from npr news or some variation thereon14 at 3100 past the hour a two-minute music bed is played which most stations cover with news updates or modules from other independent radio producers the c segment follows at 3335 duration 724 and is sometimes covered by stations with local reports as well this segment features news or cultural reports generally running the segment length segment c ends with a mid-hour newscast and station break at 4535 past the hour the d segment duration 400 is typically composed of two to three stories focusing on health news international events or short updates on national stories at 4935 past the hour the segment ends and another two-minute station break begins the e segment begins at 5130 duration 729 and differs between hours originally in the first hour the e segment was dedicated to stories and features from the world of business while in the second hour segment e included a cultural feature remembrance or softer news story usually taking the entire segment length beginning in november 2014 morning edition moved the second hour e features to the first hour e segment dropping the dedicated business segment to allow npr stations to insert broadcasts of the marketplace morning report which is separately produced and distributed by npr rival american public media prior to this change many stations would already cover one or both e segments with marketplace morning report15 however some stations continue to air marketplace morning report in place of the e segment for the first hour segment e ends at 5900 after the hour and leads into a music bed that takes the listener into the next hour or the end of the program depending on the hour and the stations program schedule stations receive over their computers the daily rundown of stories before each program which allows them to plan their coverage and decide what stories they wish to replace with local content the rundown is updated as necessary until the feed ends at noon eastern time differences in pickup timesedit most stations in the central and eastern time zones run morning edition live from 0500 to 0900 et repeating one or both hours through morning drive time some stations run only the two hours others run up to seven hours the repeats are automatically fed through the npr satellite and are updated as necessary by npr anchors in the studio when breaking news events occur in the past edwards would stay at his npr office until the program feeds ended at noon in case there was anything that required an update today with two hosts one host generally stays in the studio while the other does field reporting or works on stories for future shows and the transition is seamless unless both hosts have to be away from the studio for some reason in that instance substitute npr anchors john ydstie and linda wertheimer host the re-feeds on the west coast morning edition can run for up to seven hours running from the first live feed with the subsequent re-feeds for example kpcc in pasadena california carries morning edition from 0200 to 0900 pst kpcc handles the re-feeds uniquely instead of taking the re-feed from the satellite they roll their own by taking the tape from the feed two hours prior so that they can run the a and b segments of morning edition about three minutes earlier than rival kcrw in santa monica which takes the re-feed direct from the satellite in the event of a breaking news story kpcc runs the same feed as kcrw kjzz in phoenix arizona carries morning edition from 0300 to 0900 local time but only uses local announcers news updatesfeatures and trafficweather reports starting with the 0500 hour satellite radioedit morning edition as well as its afternoon counterpart all things considered is not carried on any of the public radio channels of sirius xm radio the leading us consumer satellite radio provider this is reportedly to reduce direct competition between sirius xm and nprs local member stations almost all of whom heavily use these flagship news programs to generate pledge revenue from listeners16 tell me more a daytime interview show hosted by journalist michel
