district heating accumulation tower from theiss near krems an der donau in lower austria with a thermal capacity of 2 gwh thermal energy storage tes is achieved with greatly differing technologies that collectively accommodate a wide range of needs it allows excess thermal energy to be collected for later use hours days or many months later at individual building multiuser building district town or even regional scale depending on the specific technology as examples energy demand can be balanced between daytime and nighttime summer heat from solar collectors can be stored interseasonally for use in winter and cold obtained from winter air can be provided for summer air conditioning storage mediums include water or ice-slush tanks ranging from small to massive masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers in clusters of small-diameter boreholes sometimes quite deep deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata shallow lined pits filled with gravel and water and top-insulated and eutectic phase-change materials other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with heat pumps from off-peak lower cost electric power a practice called peak shaving heat from combined heat and power chp power plants heat produced by renewable electrical energy that exceeds grid demand and waste heat from industrial processes heat storage both seasonal and short term is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable renewable electricity production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy

practical active solar heating systems provide storage from a few hours to a days worth of energy collected however there are a growing number of facilities that use seasonal thermal energy storage stes enabling solar energy to be stored in summer for space heating use during winter456 the drake landing solar community in alberta canada has now achieved a year-round 97 solar heating fraction a world record made possible only by incorporating stes47 molten salt is a means of storing heat at a high temperature this is a current commercial technology used in conjunction with concentrated solar power for later use in electricity generation to allow solar power to provide electricity on a more continuous basis these molten salts potassium nitrate calcium nitrate sodium nitrate lithium nitrate etc have the property to absorb and store the heat energy that is released to the water to transfer energy when needed to improve the salt properties it must be mixed in a eutectic mixture the use of both latent heat and sensible heat are also possible with high temperature solar thermal input various eutectic mixtures of metals such as aluminium and silicon alsi12 offer a high melting point suited to efficient steam generation8 while high alumina cement-based materials offer good thermal storage capabilities9 economicsedit high peak loads drive the capital expenditures of the electricity generation industry the industry meets these peak loads with low-efficiency peaking power plants usually gas turbines which have lower capital costs and since the recent drop in natural gas prices have low fuel costs as well a kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed at night can be produced at much lower marginal cost utilities have begun to pass these lower costs to consumerscitation needed in the form of time of use tou rates or real time pricing rtp rates heat storage in tanks or rock cavernsedit see also steam accumulator a steam accumulator consists of an insulated steel pressure tank containing hot water and steam under pressure as a heat storage device it is used to mediate heat production by a variable or steady source from a variable demand for heat steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in solar thermal energy projects see also hot water storage tank large stores are widely used in scandinavia to store heat for several days to decouple heat and power production and to help meet peak demands interseasonal storage in caverns has been investigated and appears to be economical10 heat storage in hot rocks concrete pebbles etcedit water has one of the highest thermal capacities heat capacity - 4.2jcmk whereas concrete has about one third of that on the other hand concrete can be heated to much higher temperatures 1200c by eg electrical heating and therefore has a much higher overall volumetric capacity thus in the example below an insulated cube of about 2.8m would appear to provide sufficient storage for a single house to meet 50 of heating demand this could in principle be used to store surplus wind or pv heat due to the ability of electrical heating to reach high temperatures at the neighborhood level the wiggenhausen-sd solar development at friedrichshafen has received international attention this features a 12,000m 420,000cuft reinforced concrete thermal store linked to 4,300m 46,000sqft of solar collectors which will supply the 570 houses with around 50 of their heating and hot water siemens builds a 36 mwh thermal storage near hamburg with 600c basalt and 1.5 mw electric output11 electric thermal storage heatersedit main article storage heater these are commonplace in european homes and consist of high-density ceramic bricks or feolite blocks heated to a high temperature with electricity and well insulated to release heat over a number of hours ice-based technologyedit main article ice storage air conditioning air conditioning can be provided more economically by using cheaper electricity at night to freeze water into ice then using the cool of the ice in the afternoon to reduce the electricity needed to handle air conditioning demands thermal energy storage using ice makes use of the large heat of fusion of water one metric ton of water one cubic meter can store 334 million joules mj or 317,000 btus 93kwh or 26.4 ton-hours in fact ice was originally transported from mountains to cities for use as a coolant and the original definition of a ton of cooling capacity heat flow was the heat to melt one ton of ice every 24 hours this is the heat flow one would expect in a 3,000-square-foot 280m2 house in boston in the summer this definition has since been replaced by less archaic units one ton hvac capacity 12,000 btuhour 3.5kw either way an agreeably small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building for a day or a week whether that ice is produced by anhydrous ammonia chillers or hauled in by horse-drawn carts as such there are developing and developed applications where ice is produced during off-peak periods and used for cooling at later time in addition to using ice in cooling applications it is also being used in heat pump based heating systems in these applications the phase change energy provides a very significant layer of thermal capacity that is near the bottom range of temperature that water source heat pumps can operate in this allows the system to ride out the heaviest heating load conditions and extends the timeframe by which the source energy elements can contribute heat back into the system cryogenic energy storageedit main article cryogenic energy storage this uses liquification of air or nitrogen as an energy store a pilot cryogenic energy system that uses liquid air as the energy store and low-grade waste heat to drive the thermal re-expansion of the air has been operating at a power station in slough uk since 2010.12 molten salt technologyedit molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night it was demonstrated in the solar two project from 1995-1999 the system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99 a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity131415 the molten salt mixtures vary the most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate it is non-flammable and nontoxic and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications the salt melts at 131c 268f it is kept liquid at 288c 550f in an insulated cold storage tank the liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to 566c 1,051f it is then sent to a hot storage tank this is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week16 when electricity is needed the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbinegenerator as used in any conventional coal oil or nuclear power plant a 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank of about 9.1 metres 30ft tall and 24 metres 79ft in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design several parabolic trough power plants in spain17 and solar power tower developer solarreserve use this thermal energy storage concept the solana generating station in the us has 6 hours of storage by molten salt hot silicon technologyedit solid or molten silicon offers much higher storage temperatures than salts with consequent greater capacity and efficiency it is being researched as a possible more energy efficient storage technology silicon is able to store more than 1mwh of energy per cubic metre at 1400c 18 19 pumped-heat electricity storageedit in pumped-heat electricity storage phes a reversible heat-pump system is used to store energy as a temperature difference between two heat stores202122 isentropicedit one system currently being developed by the uk based company isentropic operates as follows23 it comprises two insulated containers a hot vessel storing thermal energy at high temperature and high pressure and a cold vessel storing thermal energy at low temperature and low pressure both vessels are filled with crushed rock or gravel which acts as the heat storage medium the vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system is filled with the inert gas argon during the charging cycle the system uses surplus electricity to work as a heat pump argon at ambient temperature and pressure from the top of the cold store is compressed adiabatically to a pressure of 12 bar heating it to around 500c 900f the compressed gas is transferred to the top of the hot vessel where it percolates down through the gravel transferring its heat to the rock and cooling to ambient temperature the cooled but still pressurized gas emerging at the bottom of the vessel is then expanded again adiabatically back down to 1 bar which lowers its temperature to -150c the cold gas is then passed up through the cold vessel where it cools the rock while being warmed back to its initial condition the energy is recovered as electricity by reversing the cycle the hot gas from the hot vessel is expanded to drive a generator and then supplied to the cold store the cooled gas retrieved from the bottom of the cold store is compressed which heats the gas to ambient temperature the gas is then transferred to the bottom of the hot vessel to be reheated the compression and expansion processes are provided by a specially designed reciprocating machine using sliding valves surplus heat generated by inefficiencies in the process is shed to the environment through heat exchangers during the discharging cycle2023 the developer claims that a round trip efficiency of 72-80 is achievable2023 this compares to 80 achievable with pumped hydro energy storage21 electrolysis of wateredit it has also been suggested that an innovative method of storing solar energy is to use electricity generated by photovoltaic panels to electrolyse water to produce hydrogen fuel that can be stored and used to power cars and fuel cells renewably and cleanly 24 other systemsedit another proposed system uses turbomachinery and is capable of operating at much higher power levels22 researchedit storing energy in molecular bonds is being investigated energy densities equivalent to lithium-ion batteries have been achieved25 see alsoedit sustainable development portal energy portal
