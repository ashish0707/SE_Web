summary of the main ethanol blends used around the world several common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world the use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines ices is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose and used only in automobiles light-duty trucks and motorcycles anhydrous ethanol can be blended with gasoline petrol for use in gasoline engines but with high ethanol content only after minor engine modifications ethanol fuel mixtures have e numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol fuel in the mixture by volume for example e85 is 85 anhydrous ethanol and 15 gasoline low-ethanol blends from e5 to e25 are also known as gasohol though internationally the most common use of the term refers to the e10 blend blends of e10 or less are used in more than 20 countries around the world led by the united states where ethanol represented 10 of the us gasoline fuel supply in 2011.1 blends from e20 to e25 have been used in brazil since the late 1970s e85 is commonly used in the us and europe for flexible-fuel vehicles hydrous ethanol or e100 is used in brazilian neat ethanol vehicles and flex-fuel light

gasohol can be used in the internal combustion engines of most modern automobiles and light-duty vehicles without need for any modification on the engine or fuel system e10 blends are typically rated as being 2 to 3 octane numbers higher than regular gasoline and are approved for use in all new us automobiles and mandated in some areas for emissions and other reasons3 the e10 blend and lower ethanol content mixtures have been used in several countries and its use has been primarily driven by the several world energy shortages that have taken place since the 1973 oil crisis typical warning placed in the fuel filler of us vehicles regarding the capability of using up to e10 and warning against the use of blends between e20 and e85 other common blends include e5 and e7 these concentrations are generally safe for recent engines that should run on pure gasoline as of 2006 mandates for blending bioethanol into vehicle fuels had been enacted in at least 36 statesprovinces and 17 countries at the national level with most mandates requiring a blend of 10 to 15 ethanol with gasoline4 one measure of alternative fuels in the us is the gasoline-equivalent gallon geg in 2002 the us used as motor fuel ethanol equal to 137,000 terajoules tj the energy equivalent of 1.13 billion us gallons 4.3 billion liters of gasoline this was less than 1 of the total fuel used that year5 e10 and other blends of ethanol are considered to be useful in decreasing us dependence on foreign oil and can reduce carbon monoxide co emissions by 20 to 30 under the right conditions6 although e10 does decrease emissions of co and greenhouse gases such as co2 by an estimated 2 over regular gasoline it can cause increases in evaporative emissions and some pollutants depending on factors such as the age of the vehicle and weather conditions7 according to the philippine department of energy the use of not more than a 10 ethanol-gasoline mixture is not harmful to cars fuel systems8 generally automobile gasoline containing alcohol ethanol or methanol is not allowed to be used in us certificated aircraft9 availabilityedit e10 was introduced nationwide in thailand in 2007 and replaced 91 octane pure gasoline in that country in 2013.10 e10 logo required on delaware fuel dispensers e10 is commonly available in the midwestern united states it was also mandated for use in all standard automobile fuel in the state of florida by the end of 2010.11 due to the phasing out of mtbe as a gasoline additive and mainly due to the mandates established in the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 ethanol blends have increased throughout the united states and by 2009 the ethanol market share in the us gasoline supply reached almost 8 by volume1213 the tesco chain of supermarkets in the uk have started selling an e5 brand of gasoline marketed as 99 ron super-unleadedcitation needed its selling price is lower than the other two forms of high-octane unleaded on the market shells v-power 99 ron and bps ultimate 97 ron many petrol stations throughout australia now also sell e10 typically at a few cents cheaper per litre than regular unleaded it is more commonly found throughout the state of queensland due to its large sugarcane farming regions the use of e10 is also subsidised by the queensland governmentcitation needed many petrol stations no longer offer a regular 91 petrol option instead only offering regular e10 91 premium 95 and premium 98 although regular unleaded remains commonly available in victoria in sweden all 95-octane gasoline is e5 while the status of 98-octane fuel is currently unclearcitation needed the product data sheets of the major fuel chains do not clearly state ethanol content of their 98-octane gasoline in the early-mid-1990s some fuel chains sold e10 from january 2011 all 95-octane fuel in finland is e10 and 98e5 octane fuel is also available mandatory blending of ethanol was approved in mozambique but the percentage in the blend has not been specified14 south africa approved a biofuel strategy in 2007 and mandated an 8 blend of ethanol by 2013.14 a 2007 uruguayan law mandates a minimum of 5 of ethanol blended with gasoline starting in january 2015.15 the monopolic state-owned fuel producer ancap started blending premium gasoline with 10 of bioethanol in december 2009 which will be available in all the country by early january 2010.16 the other two gasolines will follow later in 2010 the dominican republic has a mandate for blending 15 of ethanol by 2015.4 chile is

country notes at the end of the article a 2011 study conducted by vtt technical research centre of finland found practically no difference in fuel consumption in normal driving conditions between commercial gasoline grades 95e10 and 98e5 sold in finland despite the public perception that fuel consumption is significantly higher with 95e10 vtt performed the comparison test under controlled laboratory conditions and their measurements showed the cars tested used an average of 10.30 liters 2.27impgal 2.72u.s.gal of 95e10 per 100km 62mi as opposed to 10.23 liters 2.25impgal 2.70u.s.gal of 98e5 per 100km 62mi the difference was 0.07 in favor of 98e5 on average meaning that using 95e10 gasoline which has a higher ethanol content increases consumption by 0.7 when the measurements are normalized the difference becomes 1.0 a result that is highly consistent with an estimation of calorific values based on approximate fuel composition which came out at 1.1 in favour of e550 e15edit typical manufacturers statement in the car owners manual regarding the vehicles capability of using up to e10 e15 contains 15 ethanol and 85 gasoline this is generally the highest ratio of ethanol to gasoline that is possible to use in vehicles recommended by some auto manufacturers to run on e10 in the us5152 this is due to ethanols hydrophilia and solvent power as a result of the energy independence and security act of 2007 which mandates an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector the us department of energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel53 the national renewable energy laboratory nrel conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines5354 in a preliminary report released in october 2008 the nrel presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of e10 e15 and e20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions catalyst and engine durability vehicle driveability engine operability and vehicle and engine materials5354 this preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as a result of the ethanol blend used no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed no cold start problems were observed at 24c 75f and 10c 50f laboratory conditions and as expected computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy53 in march 2009 a lobbying group from the ethanol industry growth energy formally requested the us environmental protection agency epa to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15 from 10 organizations doing such studies included the energy department the state of minnesota the renewable fuels association the rochester institute of technology the minnesota center for automotive research and stockholm university in sweden55 epas e15 label required to be displayed in all e15 fuel dispensers in the us in october 2010 the epa granted a waiver to allow up to 15 of ethanol blended with gasoline to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2007 or later representing about 15 of vehicles on us roads565758 in january 2011 the waiver was expanded to authorize use of e15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles the epa also decided not to grant any waiver for e15 use in any motorcycles heavy-duty vehicles or nonroad engines because current testing data do not support such a waiver according to the renewable fuels association the e15 waivers now cover 62 of vehicles on the road in the us and the ethanol group estimates if all 2001 and newer cars and pickups were to use e15 the theoretical blend wall for ethanol use would be approximately 17.5 billion gallons 66.2 billion liters per year the epa was still studying if older cars can withstand a 15 ethanol blend5960 the epa waiver authorizes sale of e15 only from sep 15 to may 31 out of a black hose and a yellow hose to flex fuel vehicles only from june 1 to sep 14 retailers have shunned building infrastructure due to the costly regulatory requirements which have created a practical barrier to the commercialization of the higher blend most fuel stations do not have enough pumps to offer the new blend few existing pumps are certified to dispense e15 and no dedicated tanks are readily available to store e15 also some state and federal regulations would have to change before e15 can be legally sold5657 the national association of convenience stores which represents most gasoline retailers considers the potential for actual e15 demand is small because the auto industry is not embracing the fuel and is not adjusting their warranties or recommendations for the fuel type one possible solution to the infrastructure barriers is the introduction of blender pumps that allow consumers to turn a dial to select the level of ethanol which would also allow owners of flexible-fuel cars to buy e85 fuel60 in june 2011 epa in cooperation with the federal trade commission issued its final ruling regarding the e15 warning label required to be displayed in all e15 fuel dispensers in the us to inform consumers about what vehicles can and what vehicles and equipment cannot use the e15 blend both the alliance of automobile manufacturers and the national petrochemical and refiners association complained that relying solely on this warning label is not enough to protect consumers from misfueling6162 in july 2012 a fueling station in lawrence kansas became the first in the us to sell the e15 blend the fuel is sold through a blender pump that allows customers to choose between e10 e15 e30 or e85 with the latter blends sold only to flexible-fuel vehicles63 as of june 2013update there are about 24 fueling stations selling e15 out of 180,000 stations across the us64 blender fuel pump in east lansing michigan selling e15 together with the standard gasoline e10 and the higher blends e30 and e85 in december 2010 several groups including the alliance of automobile manufacturers the american petroleum institute the association of international automobile manufacturers the national marine manufacturers association the outdoor power equipment institute and the grocery manufacturers association filed suit against the epa in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the plaintiffs argued the epa does not have the authority to issue a partial waiver that covers some cars and not others among other arguments the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the e15 mixture it was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years6566 in august 2012 the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the epa the case was thrown out on a technical reason as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge epas decision to issue the waiver for e156667 in june 2013 the us supreme court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the epa ruling about e15 and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand64 2012 toyota camry hybrid fuel filler cap showing warning regarding the maximum ethanol blend allowed by the carmaker up to e10 gasoline the warning label indicates that ethanol blends between e15 to e85 shall not be used in this vehicle as of november 2012update sales of e15 are not authorized in california and according to the california air resources board carb the blend is still awaiting approval and in a public statement the agency said that it would take several years to complete the vehicle testing and rule development necessary to introduce a new transportation fuel into californias market68 according to a survey conducted by the american automobile association aaa in 2012 only about 12 million out of the more than 240 million light-duty vehicles on the us roads in 2012 are approved by manufacturers are fully compliant with e15 gasoline according with the association bmw chrysler nissan toyota and volkswagen warned that their warranties will not cover e15-related damage69 despite the controversy in order to adjust to epa regulations 2012 and 2013 model year vehicles manufactured by general motors can use fuel containing up to 15 percent ethanol as indicated in the vehicle owners manuals however the carmaker warned that for model year 2011 or earlier vehicles they strongly recommend that gm customers refer to their owners manuals for the proper fuel designation for their vehicles ford motor company also is manufacturing all of its 2013 vehicles e15 compatible including hybrid electrics and vehicles with ecoboost engines70 also porsches built since 2001 are approved by its manufacturer to use e1569 volkswagen announced that for the 2014 model year its entire lineup will be e15 capable71 fiat chrysler automobiles announced in august 2015 that all 2016 model year chryslerfiat jeep dodge and ram vehicles will be e15 compatible72 in november 2013 the environmental protection agency opened for public comment its proposal to reduce the amount of ethanol required in the us gasoline supply as mandated by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the agency cited problems with increasing the blend of ethanol above 10 this limit known as the blend wall refers to the practical difficulty in incorporating increasing amounts of ethanol into the transportation fuel supply at volumes exceeding those achieved by the sale of nearly all gasoline as e107374 he15edit example of public gas station with he15 next to diesel and regular gasoline a 15 hydrous ethanol and 85 gasoline blend he15 has been introduced at public gas stations in the netherlands since 2008 ethanol fuel specifications worldwide traditionally dictate use of anhydrous ethanol less than 1 water for gasoline blending this results in additional costs energy usage and environmental impacts associated with the extra processing step required to dehydrate the hydrous ethanol produced via distillation 3.5-4.9 vol water to meet the current anhydrous ethanol specifications a patented discovery reveals hydrous ethanol can be effectively used in most ethanolgasoline blending applications75 76 according to the brazilian anp specification hydrous ethanol contains up to 4.9 vol water in he15 this would be up to 0.74 vol water in the overall mixture japanese and german scientific evidence revealed the water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol 77 the experiments show that water in fuel ethanol inhibits dry corrosion at 10,000 ppm water in the e50 experiments by jari and 3,500 ppm water in the e20 experiments by tu darmstadt the alcoholatealkoxide corrosion stopped in the fuel ethanol this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume in the case of jari and 5 x 3500 17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume in the case of tu darmstadt the observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol the reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends when enough water is present in the fuel the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer which is why the corrosion stops the aluminum alcoholatealkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer which is why the corrosion continues in other words water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer based on the japanesegerman results a minimum of 2 vol or 2.52 mm water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in petrol at e10 levels water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance thermodynamic efficiency and reduces overall co2 emissionscitation needed he15 promotion amsterdam overall a transition from anhydrous to hydrous ethanol for gasoline blending is expected to make a significant contribution to ethanols cost-competitiveness fuel cycle net energy balance air quality and greenhouse gas emissions78 the level of blending above 10 vv is chosen both from a technical safety perspective and to distinguish the product in europe from regular unleaded petrol for reasons of taxes and customer clarity small-scale tests have shown many vehicles with modern engine types can run smoothly on this hydrous ethanol blend mixed tanking scenarios with anhydrous ethanol blends at 5 or 10 level do not induce phase separation as avoiding mixing with e0 in particular at extremely low temperatures in logistic systems and engines is not recommended a separate specification for controlled usage is presented in a netherlands technical agreement nta 8115 the

was reduced from 20 to 18 in april 2011.8284 e20 contains 20 ethanol and 80 gasoline while e25 contains 25 ethanol these blends have been widely used in brazil since the late 1970s.83 as a response to the 1973 oil crisis the brazilian government made mandatory the blend of ethanol fuel with gasoline fluctuating between 10 to 22 from 1976 until 1992.83 due to this mandatory minimum gasoline blend pure gasoline e0 is no longer sold in brazil a federal law was passed in october 1993 establishing a mandatory blend of 22 anhydrous ethanol e22 in the entire country this law also authorized the executive to set different percentages of ethanol within pre-established boundaries and since 2003 these limits were fixed at a maximum of 25 e25 and a minimum of 20 e20 by volume2483 since then the government has set the percentage on the ethanol blend according to the results of the sugarcane harvest and ethanol production from sugarcane resulting in blend variations even within the same year83 since july 1 2007 the mandatory blend was set at 25 of anhydrous ethanol e25 by executive decree80 and this has been the standard gasoline blend sold throughout brazil most of the time as of 2011.85 however as a result of a supply shortage and the resulting high ethanol fuel prices in 2010 the government mandated a temporary 90-day blend reduction from e25 to e20 beginning february 1 2010.8186 as prices rose abruptly again due to supply shortages that took place again between the 2010 and 2011 harvest seasons some ethanol had to be imported from the united states and in april 2011 the government reduced the minimum mandatory blend to 18 leaving the mandatory blend range between e18 and e258284 a blender pump is a multifuel blend dispenser that allows customers to choose between e20 e30 e85 or any other preselected blend all brazilian automakers have adapted their gasoline engines to run smoothly with this range of mixtures thus all gasoline vehicles are built to run with blends from e20 to e25 defined by local law as common gasoline type c8788 some vehicles might work properly with lower concentrations of ethanol but with a few exceptions they are unable to run smoothly with

80 since april 2009.96 the rapid growth in e20 demand is because most vehicle models launched since 2009 were e20-compatible and sales of e20 are expected to grow faster once more local automakers start producing small e20-compatible fuel-efficient cars the thai government is promoting ethanol usage through subsidies as ethanol costs four baht a litre more than gasoline96 a state law approved

current vehicles and fuel dispensing equipment designed for e1097 a study commissioned by bp and published in september 2013 concluded that the use of advanced biofuels in the uk and particularly e20 cellulosic ethanol is a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than using plug-in electric vehicles pevs in the timeframe to 2030 the study also found that the use of higher blends of biofuels is complementary to hybrid electric vehicles hevs and plug-in hybrids phevs battery electric vehicles bevs can deliver strong co2 savings with a decarbonised electric grid but are expected to have significantly higher costs than internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid cars to 2030 as the latter are expected to be the most popular models by 2030 according to the study in 2030 an e20 blend

with plans to expand to 15 stations by 2012.96 a major restriction hampering sales of e85 flex vehicles or fuelling with e85 is the limited infrastructure available to sell e85 to the public as by 2014 only 2 percent of motor fuel stations offered e85111 up from about 1 percent in 2011.112 as of november 2015update there were only 3,218 gasoline fueling stations selling e85 to the public in the

temperatures below 15c 59f the brazilian 2008 honda civicflex-fuel has outside access to the secondary reservoir gasoline tank in the front right side shown by the arrow e100 is pure ethanol fuel straight hydrous ethanol as an automotive fuel has been widely used in brazil since the late 1970s for neat ethanol vehicles83130 and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles131132 the ethanol fuel used in brazil is distilled close to the azeotrope mixture of 95.63 ethanol and 4.37 water by weight which is approximately 3.5 water by volume133 the azeotrope is the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved by simple fractional distillation the maximum water concentration according to the anp specification is 4.9 vol approximately 6.1 weight 134 the e nomenclature is not adopted in brazil but hydrated ethanol can be tagged as e100 meaning it does not have any gasoline because the water content is not an additive but rather a residue from the distillation process however straight hydrous ethanol is also called e95 by some authors135136 the first commercial vehicle capable of running on pure ethanol was the ford model t produced from 1908 through 1927 it was fitted with a carburetor with adjustable jetting allowing use of gasoline or ethanol or a combination of both107137138139 at that time other car manufacturers also provided engines for ethanol fuel use107 thereafter and as a response to the 1973 and 1979 energy crises the first modern vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol e100 was launched in the brazilian market the fiat 147,140 after testing with several prototypes developed by the brazilian subsidiaries of fiat volkswagen general motors and ford130 as of september 2012update there were 1.1 million neat ethanol vehicles still in use in brazil141 since 2003 brazilian newer flex-fuel vehicles are capable of running on pure hydrous ethanol e100 or blended with any combination of e20 to e275 gasoline131132 a mixture made with anhydrous ethanol the national mandatory blend2480 as of september 2012update there were 17.1 million flexible-fuel vehicles running on brazilian roads141 e100 imposes a limitation on normal vehicle operation as ethanols lower evaporative pressure as compared to gasoline causes problems when cold starting the engine at temperatures below 15c 59f.142 for this reason both pure ethanol and e100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline once started the engine is then switched back to ethanol142 an improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to eliminate the need for the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting143144 and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as 5c 23f,145 the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the brazilian territory146 the polo e-flex launched in march 2009 was the first flex-fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start the warming system called flex start was developed by robert bosch gmbh147148 swedish carmakers have developed ethanol-only capable engines for the new saab aero x biopower 100 concept e100 with a v6 engine which is fuelled entirely by e100 bioethanol149150 and the limited edition of the koenigsegg ccxr a version of the ccx converted to use e85 or e100 as well as standard 98-octane gasoline and currently the fastest and most powerful flex-fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged v8 producing 1018hp when running on biofuel as compared to 806hp on 91-octane unleaded gasoline151152 the higher fuel efficiency of e100 compared to methanol in high performance race cars resulted in indianapolis 500 races in 2007 and 2008 being run on 100 fuel-grade ethanol153 use limitationsedit modifications to enginesedit the use of ethanol blends in conventional gasoline vehicles is restricted to low mixtures as ethanol is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine and fuel system also the engine has to be adjusted for a higher compression ratio as compared to a pure gasoline engine to take advantage of ethanols higher oxygen content thus allowing an improvement in fuel efficiency and a reduction of tailpipe emissions100 the following table shows the required modifications to gasoline engines to run smoothly and without degrading any materials this information is based on the modifications made by the brazilian automotive industry at the beginning of the ethanol program in that country in the late 1970s and reflects the experience of volkswagen do brasil154 required adjustments to gasoline engines to cope with different blends of ethanol fuel ethanol blend carburetor fuel injection fuel pump fuel pressure device fuel
