control is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy1 birth control has been used since ancient times but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century2 planning making available and using birth control is called family planning34 some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally religiously or politically undesirable2 the most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females intrauterine devices iuds and implantable birth control this is followed by a number of hormone based methods including oral pills patches vaginal rings and injections less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods the least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation sterilization while highly effective is not usually reversible all other methods are reversible most immediately upon stopping them5 safe sex practices such as with the use of male or female condoms can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections6 other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases7 emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex89 some argue not having sex as a form of birth control but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education due to non-compliance1011 in teenagers pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group1213 while all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people14 long-acting reversible birth control such as implants iuds or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy13 after the delivery of a child a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth while others require a delay of up to six months in women who are breastfeeding progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills in women who have reached menopause it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period14 about 222million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method1516 birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40 about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008 and could prevent 70 if the full demand for birth control were met1718 by lengthening the time between pregnancies birth control can improve adult womens delivery outcomes and the survival of their children17 in the developing world womens earnings assets weight and their childrens schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control19 birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children more women participating in the workforce and less use of scarce resources1920 contents 1 methods 1.1 hormonal 1.2 barrier 1.3 intrauterine devices 1.4 sterilization 1.5 behavioral 1.5.1

before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up to a few days after sex effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year25 and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness such as tubal ligation26 the most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits27 surgical sterilization implantable hormones and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1.21 hormonal contraceptive pills patches or vaginal rings and the lactational amenorrhea method lam if used strictly can also have first-year or for lam first-6-month failure rates of less than 1.27 with typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high at 9 due to incorrect usage21 other methods such as condoms diaphragms and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage27 the american academy of pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people28 while all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects the risk is less than that of pregnancy27 after stopping or removing many methods of birth control including oral contraceptives iuds implants and injections the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control29 in those with specific health problems certain forms of birth control may require further investigations30 for women who are otherwise healthy many methods of birth control should not require a medical examincluding birth control pills injectable or implantable birth control and condoms31 specifically a pelvic exam breast exam or blood test before starting birth control pills do not appear to affect outcomes and therefore are not required3233 in 2009 the world health organization who published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control30 hormonaledit hormonal contraception is available in a number of different forms including oral pills implants under the skin injections patches iuds and a vaginal ring they are currently available only for women although hormonal contraceptives for men have and are being clinically tested34 there are two types of oral birth control pills the combined oral contraceptive pills which contain both estrogen and progesterone and the progestogen-only pills sometimes called minipills35 if either is taken during pregnancy they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects33 both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucous3637 their effectiveness depends on the user remembering to take the pills33 they may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation37 combined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots38 venous clots on average increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years39 which is still less than that associated with pregnancy38 due to this risk they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke40 the effect on sexual desire is varied with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most41 combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer4243 they often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps33 the lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness nausea and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products42 progestin-only pills injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins3844 in those with a history of arterial blood clots non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used38 progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods with some users reporting no periods45 the progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line46 the perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin depo-provera is 0.2 the typical use first failure rate is 6.21 three varieties of birth control pills in calendar oriented packaging birth control pills a transdermal contraceptive patch a nuvaring vaginal ring barrieredit barrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus47 they include male condoms female condoms cervical caps diaphragms and contraceptive sponges with spermicide47 globally condoms are the most common method of birth control48 male condoms are put on a mans erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner49 modern condoms are most often made from latex but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane or lambs intestine49 female condoms are also available most often made of nitrile latex or polyurethane50 male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive easy to use and have few adverse effects51 making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency52 in japan about 80 of couples who are using birth control use condoms while in germany this number is about 25,53 and in the united states it is 18.54 male condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18 and 12 respectively21 with perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2 first-year failure rate versus a 6 first-year rate with the diaphragm21 condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as hivaids5 contraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide27 like diaphragms they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective27 typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth being 24 in those who have and 12 in those who have not21 the sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward27 allergic reactions55 and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported56 a rolled up male condom an unrolled male latex condom a polyurethane female condom a diaphragm vaginal-cervical barrier in its case with a quarter us coin a contraceptive sponge set inside its open package intrauterine devicesedit copper t shaped iud with removal strings the current intrauterine devices iud are small devices often t-shaped often containing either copper or levonorgestrel which are inserted into the uterus they are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control57 failure rates with the copper iud is about 0.8 while the levonorgestrel iud has a failure rates of 0.2 in the first year of use58 among types of birth control they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users59 as of 2007 iuds are the most widely used form of reversible contraception with more than 180million users worldwide60 evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents59 and those who have and have not previously had children61 iuds do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery62 they may also be used immediately after an abortion63 once removed even after long term use fertility returns to normal immediately64 while copper iuds may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps65 hormonal iuds may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether62 cramping can be treated with nsaids66 other potential complications include expulsion 25 and rarely perforation of the uterus less than 0.7.6266 a previous model of the intrauterine device the dalkon shield was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion67 sterilizationedit surgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men2 there are no significant long-term side effects and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer2 short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation268 after a vasectomy there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two69 with tubal ligation complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia70 neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections2 this decision may cause regret in some men and women of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation about 5 regret their decision as compared with 20 of women aged under 30.2 by contrast less than 5 of men are likely to regret sterilization men more likely to regret sterilization are younger have young or no children or have an unstable marriage71 in a survey of biological parents 9 stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again72 although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure73 it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia in women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse73 pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy73 the number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent74 rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal74 sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men75 behavioraledit behavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract either altogether or when an egg may be present76 if used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4 however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85.77 fertility awarenessedit a cyclebeads used for estimating fertility based on days since last menstruation fertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse76 techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature cervical secretions or the day of the cycle76 they have typical first-year failure rates of 24 perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4 to 5.21 the evidence on which these estimates are based however is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early76 globally they are used by about 3.6 of couples78 if based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign the method is referred to as symptothermal overall first-year failure rates of 2 to 20 have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method7980 withdrawaledit the withdrawal method also known as coitus interruptus is the practice of ending intercourse pulling out before ejaculation81 the main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner81 first-year failure rates vary from 4 with perfect usage to 22 with typical usage21 it is not considered birth control by some medical professionals27 there is little data regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid82 while some tentative research did not find sperm82 one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers83 the withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3 of couples78 abstinenceedit though some groups advocate total sexual abstinence by which they mean the avoidance of all sexual activity in the context of birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse8485 abstinence is 100 effective in preventing pregnancy however not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex8687 abstinence-only sex education does not reduce teenage pregnancy788 teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education as compared with comprehensive sex education8889 some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup methods available such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills90 deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control91 while this generally avoids pregnancy pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex genital rubbing and the penis exiting from anal intercourse where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vaginas lubricating fluids9293 lactationedit the lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a womans natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding94 this usually requires the presence of no periods exclusively breastfeeding the infant and a child younger than six months24 the world health organization states that if breastfeeding is the infants only source of nutrition the failure rate is 2 in the six months following delivery95 six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0 and 7.5.96 failure rates increase to 47 at one year and 13 at two years97 feeding formula pumping instead of nursing the use of a pacifier and feeding solids all increase its failure rate98 in those who are exclusively breastfeeding about 10 begin having periods before three months and 20 before six months97 in those who are not breastfeeding fertility may return four weeks after delivery97 emergencyedit a single-dose emergency contraceptive pill emergency contraceptive methods are medications sometimes misleadingly referred to as morning-after pills99 or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy8 they work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization2100 they are unlikely to affect implantation but this has not been completely exclude100 a number of options exist including high dose birth control pills levonorgestrel mifepristone ulipristal and iuds101 levonorgestrel pills when used within 3days decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70 resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2.8 ulipristal when used within 5days decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85 pregnancy rate 1.4 and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel8101102 mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper iuds are the most effective method101 iuds can be inserted up to fivedays after intercourse and prevent about 99 of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2.2103 this makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive104 in those who are overweight or obese levonorgestrel is less effective and an iud or ulipristal is recommended105 providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections condom use pregnancy rates or sexual risk-taking behavior106107 all methods have minimal side effects101 dual protectionedit dual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy108 this can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex109110 if pregnancy is a high concern using two methods at the same time is reasonable109 and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy111 effectsedit healthedit see also maternal health maternal mortality rate as of 2010.112 contraceptive use and total fertility rate by region contraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40 about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008 and could prevent 70 of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met1718 these benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk17 birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies17 in this population outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery17113 delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready113 teenage pregnancies especially among younger teens are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth low birth weight and death of the infant12 in the united states 82 of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned66 comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in

assets body mass index and their childrens schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control19 family planning via the use of modern birth control is one of the most cost-effective health interventions115 for every dollar spent the united nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved16 these cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses115 while all methods are beneficial financially the use of copper iuds resulted in the greatest savings115 the total medical cost for a pregnancy delivery and care of a newborn in the united states is on average 21,000 for a vaginal delivery and 31,000 for a caesarean section as of 2012.116 in most other countries the cost is less than half116 for a child born in 2011 an average us family will spend 235,000 over 17 years to raise them117 prevalenceedit main article prevalence of birth control percentage of women using modern

different methods are used varies widely between countries118 the most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives while in africa it is oral contraceptives and in latin america and asia it is sterilization118 in the developing world overall 35 of birth control is via female sterilization 30 is via iuds 12 is via oral contraceptives 11 is via condoms and 4 is via male sterilization118 while less used in the developed countries than the developing world the number of women using iuds as of 2007 was more than 180million.60 avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6 of women of childbearing age with usage as high as 20 in areas of south america119 as of 2005 12 of couples are using a male form of birth control either condoms or a vasectomy with higher rates in the developed world120 usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009.118 contraceptive use among women in sub-saharan africa has risen from about 5 in 1991 to about 30 in 2006.121 as of 2012 57 of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy 867 of 1520million.122 about 222 million women however were not able to access birth control 53million of whom were in sub-saharan africa and 97million of whom were in asia122 this results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year118 part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons2 while another contributor is poverty123 due to restrictive abortion laws in sub-saharan africa many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy resulting in about 24 obtaining unsafe abortions each year123 historyedit main article history of birth control early historyedit ancient silver coin from cyrene depicting a stalk of silphium the egyptian ebers papyrus from 1550bce and the kahun papyrus from 1850bce have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control the use of honey acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm124125 it is believed that in ancient greece silphium was used as birth control which due to its effectiveness and thus desirability was harvested into extinction126 in medieval europe any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the catholic church124 although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina127 women in the middle ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy128 the oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of dudley castle in england and are dated back to 1640.128 they were made of animal gut and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the english civil war128 casanova living in 18th century italy described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy however condoms only became widely available in the 20th century124 birth control movementedit and the villain still pursues her a satirical victorian era postcard the birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries129 the malthusian league based on the ideas of thomas malthus was established in 1877 in the united kingdom to educate the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control130 it was founded during the knowlton trial of annie besant and charles bradlaugh who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control131 in the united states margaret sanger and otto bobsein popularized the phrase birth control in 1914.132133 sanger was mainly active in the united states but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s at the time under the comstock law distribution of birth control information was illegal she jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the united states for the united kingdom to return in 1915.134 sanger established a short-lived birth-control clinic based in the brownville section of brooklyn new york 135 in 1916 which was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest136 the publicity surrounding the arrest trial and appeal sparked birth control activism across the united states137 the first permanent birth-control clinic was established in britain in 1921 by marie stopes working with the malthusian league138 the clinic run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors139 offered womens birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms in 1921 sanger founded the american birth control league which later became the planned parenthood federation of america140 in 1924 the society for the provision of birth control clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics this led to the opening of a second clinic in greengate salford in 1926.141 throughout the 1920s stopes and other feminist pioneers including dora russell and stella browne played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex in april 1930 the birth control conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere three months later the ministry of health in the united kingdom allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres142 in 1936 the us court ruled in us v one package that medically prescribing contraception to save a persons life or well being was not illegal under the comstock law following this decision the american medical association committee on contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control a national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception by 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the united states despite their advertisement still being illegal first lady eleanor roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning143 in 1966 president lyndon b johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services and the federal government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families144 the affordable care act passed into law on march 23 2010 under president barack obama requires all plans in the health insurance marketplace to cover contraceptive methods these include barrier methods hormonal methods implanted devices emergency contraceptives and sterilization procedures145 modern methodsedit in 1909 richard richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut which was further developed and marketed in germany by ernst grfenberg in the late 1920s.146 in 1951 a chemist named carl djerassi from mexico city made the hormones in progesterone pill using mexican yams147 djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients meanwhile gregory pincus and john rock with help from the planned parenthood federation of america developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s such as mestranolnoretynodrel which became publicly available in the 1960s through the food and drug administration under the name enovid140148 medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.149 society and cultureedit legal positionsedit further information timeline of reproductive rights legislation human rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services these include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services remove laws that limit access to family planning ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price and create a process to review the programs implemented if governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations150 in america griswold v connecticut overturned a state law prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional right to privacy for marital relationships in 1971 eisenstadt v baird extended this right to privacy to single people151 in 2010 the united nations launched the every woman every child movement to assess the progress toward meeting womens contraceptive needs the initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the worlds 69 poorest countries by the year 2020 additionally they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives152 the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists acog recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications153 religious viewsedit main article religion and birth control religions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control154 the roman catholic church officially only accepts natural family planning155 although large numbers of catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control156157158 among protestants there is a wide range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control159 views in judaism range from the stricter orthodox sect to the more relaxed reform sect160 hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives161 a common buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable while intervening after conception has occurred is not162 in islam contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health although their use is discouraged by some163 world contraception dayedit september 26 is world contraception day devoted to raising awareness and improving education about sexual and reproductive health with a vision of a world where every pregnancy is wanted164 it is supported by a group of governments and international ngos including the office of population affairs the asian pacific council on contraception centro latinamericano salud y mujer the european society of contraception and reproductive health the german foundation for world population the international federation of pediatric and adolescent gynecology international planned parenthood federation the marie stopes international population services international the population council the united states agency for international development usaid and women deliver164 misconceptionsedit there are a number of common misconceptions regarding sex and pregnancy165 douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control166 additionally it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended167 women can become pregnant the first time they have sexual intercourse168 and in any sexual position169 it is possible although not very likely to become pregnant during menstruation170 research directionsedit femalesedit improvements of existing birth control methods are needed as around half of those who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth control at the time27 a number of alterations of existing contraceptive methods are being studied including a better female condom an improved diaphragm a patch containing only progestin and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone171 this vaginal ring appears to be effective for three or four months and is currently available in some areas of the world171 for women who rarely have sex the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising172 a number of methods to perform sterilization via the cervix are being studied one involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility while the procedure is inexpensive and does not require surgical skills there are concerns regarding long-term side effects173 another substance polidocanol which functions in the same manner is being looked at171 a device called essure which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them was approved in the united states in 2002.173 malesedit main article male contraceptive methods of male birth control include condoms vasectomies and withdrawal174175 between 25 and 75 of males who are sexually active would use hormonal birth control if it was available for them120174 a number of hormonal and non-hormonal methods are in trials120 and there is some research looking at the possibility of contraceptive vaccines176 a reversible surgical method under investigation is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance risug which consists of injecting a polymer gel styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide into the vas deferens an injection with sodium bicarbonate washes out the substance and restores fertility another is an intravas device which involves putting a urethane plug into the vas deferens to block it a combination of an androgen and a progestin seems promising as do selective androgen receptor modulators120 ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies177 other animalsedit neutering or spaying which involves removing some of the reproductive organs is often carried out as a method of birth control in household pets many animal
