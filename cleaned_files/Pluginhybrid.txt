environment portal v t e a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle phev is a hybrid electric vehicle that uses rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device that can be recharged by plugging it in to an external source of electric power a phev shares the characteristics both of a conventional hybrid electric vehicle having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ice and of an all-electric vehicle having a plug to connect to the electrical grid most phevs are passenger cars but there are also phev versions of commercial vehicles and vans utility trucks buses trains motorcycles scooters and military vehicles the cost of electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline in california3 compared to conventional vehicles phevs produce less air pollution locally and require less petroleum phevs may produce less in the way of greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming45 than conventional vehicles do phevs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated with all-electric vehicles because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted giving phevs driving-range comparable to that of other vehicles that have gasoline and diesel tanks678 plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel at the point of use during their all-electric range plug-in hybrids greenhouse-gas emissions during the operating in the all-electric range mode depends on the type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the battery is charged9 see greenhouse gas emissions below if the batteries are charged directly from renewable sources off the electrical grid then the tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions are zero when running only on battery power other benefits include improved national energy security less frequent fill-ups at the filling station the convenience of home recharging opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home and vehicle-to-grid v2g applications1011 several countries including the united states china and several european countries have enacted laws to ease the introduction of phevs through grants and tax credits emissions mandates and financing research and development in advanced batteries and related technology chinese battery manufacturer and automaker byd auto released the f3dm to the chinese

range battery packs a plug-in hybrids all-electric range is designated by phev-miles or phevkilometerskm in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone for example a phev-20 can travel twenty miles 32km without using its combustion engine so it may also be designated as a phev32km23 the energy independence and security act of 2007 defines a plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that draws motive power from a battery with a capacity of at least 4 kilowatt hours can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power and is a light- medium- or heavy-duty motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle this distinguishes phevs from regular hybrid cars mass marketed today which do not use any electricity from the grid the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee defines phevs similarly but also requires that the hybrid electric vehicle be able to drive at least ten miles 16km in all-electric mode phev-10 phev16km while consuming no gasoline or diesel fuel24 the california air resources board uses the term off-vehicle charge capable ovcc to mean having the capability to charge a battery from an off-vehicle electric energy source that cannot be connected or coupled to the vehicle in any manner while the vehicle is being driven25 other popular terms sometimes used for plug-in hybrids are grid-connected

lohner-porsche mixte hybrid produced as early as 1899 was the first hybrid electric car3031 early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation however the term plug-in hybrid has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket the term plug-in hybrid electric vehicle was coined by uc davis professor andrew frank32 who has been called the father of the modern plug-in hybrid333435 the july 1969 issue of popular science featured an article on the general motors xp-883 plug-in hybrid the concept commuter vehicle housed six 12-volt

ron gremban is used in daily driving as well as a test bed for various improvements to the system39 on july 18 2006 toyota announced that it plans to develop a hybrid vehicle that will run locally on batteries charged by a household electrical outlet before switching over to a gasoline engine for longer hauls40 in april 2007 toyota said it planned to migrate to lithium-ion batteries in future hybrid models41 but not in the 2009 model year prius42 lithium-ion batteries are expected to significantly improve fuel economy and have a higher energy-to-weight ratio but cost more to produce and raise safety concerns due to high operating temperatures42 on november 29 2006 gm announced plans to introduce a production plug-in hybrid version of saturns greenline vue suv with an all-electric range of 10mi 16km.43 gm announced in january 2007 that contracts had been awarded to two companies to design and test lithium-ion batteries for the vehicle44 but the saturn line was discontinued before the hybrid vue could be released gm has said that they plan on introducing plug-in and other hybrids for the next several years43 president bush with a123systems ceo on the white house south

system dubbed e-power which debuted with the nissan gripz concept crossover showcased at the 2015 frankfurt auto show122 technologyedit powertrainsedit further information hybrid vehicle drivetrains the generation 1 chevrolet volt operates primarily as a series hybrid the toyota prius plug-in hybrid is a series-parallel hybrid phevs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures as conventional electric hybrids123 series hybrids use an internal combustion engine ice to turn a generator which in turn supplies current to an electric motor which then rotates the vehicles drive wheels a battery or supercapacitor pack or a combination of the two can be used to store excess charge examples of series hybrids vehicles include the chevrolet volt first generation fisker karma renault kangoo electroad toyotas japan-only coaster light-duty passenger bus daimler ags hybrid orion bus opel flextreme concept car swissauto rex vw polo124 prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives with an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ice as is the case for other architectures series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank125 parallel hybrids such as hondas insight civic and accord hybrids can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sourcesfor example an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicles engine and transmission a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicles axles while its electric motor drives the other axle andor a generator used for recharging the batteries this type is called a road-coupled hybrid the audi duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ice at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ice both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ice vehicle126 series-parallel hybrids have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mode hybrid powertrains currently used by ford lexus nissan chevrolet and toyota which some refer to as series-parallel with power-split can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time as of 2007 most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architecture127 the toyota prius plug-in hybrid operates as a series-parallel hybrid128 charging systemsedit batteries are dc devices while grid power is ac in order to charge the batteries a dc charger must be utilized the charger can be located in several locations on-board chargers are mounted inside the vehicle since the charger takes up space and adds weight its power capacity is generally limited by practical considerations avoiding carrying a more powerful charger that can only be fully utilized at certain locations however carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a power connection can be found off-board chargers can be as large as needed and mounted at fixed locations like the garage or dedicated charging stations built with dedicated wiring these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly however as the output of these chargers is dc each battery system requires the output to be changed for that car modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly using electric motors inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils and the existing high-power inverter as the ac-to-dc charger as these components are already required on the car and are designed to handle any practical power capability they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size ac propulsion uses this charging method referred to as reductive charging129 modes of operationedit regardless of its architecture a plug-in hybrid may be capable of charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes combinations of these two modes are termed blended mode or mixed-mode these vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in all-electric mode either at low speeds only or at all speeds these modes manage the vehicles battery discharge strategy and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required130 charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged phev to operate exclusively or depending on the vehicle almost exclusively except during hard acceleration on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level at which time the vehicles internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged this period is the vehicles all-electric range this is the only mode that a battery electric vehicle can operate in hence their limited range131 the redesigned renault kangoo electroad operates in blended mode using engine and battery power simultaneously blended mode is a kind of charge-depleting mode it is normally employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrain a blended control strategy typically increases the distance from stored grid electricity compared to a charge-depleting strategy132 the renault kangoo and some toyota prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operation the electricit and electroad versions of the kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles the electroad had a modest internal combustion engine which extended its range somewhat conversions of 2004 and later model toyota prius can only run without using the ice at speeds of less than about 42mph 68kmh due to the limits dictated by the vehicles powertrain control software however at faster speeds electric power can still be used to displace gasoline thus improving the fuel economy in blended mode and generally doubling the fuel efficiency charge-sustaining mode is used by production hybrid vehicles hevs today and combines the operation of the vehicles two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band over the course of a trip in a hev the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change133 the battery in a hev can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized134 for example a phev-20 prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles 8km of low speed charge-depleting then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles 32km using 10 miles 16km worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel economy finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles 8km without the internal combustion engine until the full 20 miles 32km of all-electric range are exhausted at this point the vehicle can revert to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles 16km until the final destination is reached such a trip would be considered a mixed mode as multiple modes are employed in one trip this contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a phevs all-electric range conversely the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a phev would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode as used by a conventional hybrid electric power storageedit further information electric vehicle battery and charging station phevs typically require deeper battery charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids because the number of full cycles influences battery life this may be less than in traditional hevs which do not deplete their batteries as fully however some authors argue that phevs will soon become standard in the automobile industry135 design issues and trade-offs against battery life capacity heat dissipation weight costs and safety need to be solved136 advanced battery technology is under development promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume137 and battery life expectancy is expected to increase138 the cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide this material is expensive and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged if the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge the price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about us5000 some us3000 of which is for their nimh battery packs at early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation the conventional hybrid premium could fall to us2000 in five years with us1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries providing for a three-year payback the payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids because of their larger more expensive batteries139 nickelmetal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled toyota for example has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a us200 credit for each battery returned140 however plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids and thus require more resources pacific gas and electric company pge has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes they state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles their residual capacity still has significant value141 more recently general motors gm has said it has been approached by utilities interested in using recycled volt batteries as a power storage system a secondary market that could bring down the cost of the volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumers142 lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 is a class of cathode materials used in lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the auto industry valence technologies produce a lithium iron manganese phosphate lifemnpo4 battery with lg chem selling lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 batteries for the chevy volt and a123 produces a lithium nano-phosphate battery the most important merit of this battery type is safety and high-power lithium iron phosphate batteries are one of three

supercapacitors are used in some plug-in hybrids such as afs trinitys concept prototype to store rapidly available energy with their high power density in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery life147148 the csiros ultrabattery combines a supercapacitor and a lead acid battery in a single unit creating a hybrid car battery that lasts longer costs less and is more powerful than current technologies used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs149 the optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce oil consumption running costs or emissions but a recent study150 concluded that the best choice of phev battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charges our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less a low-capacity phev sized with an aer all electric range of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption cost and greenhouse gas emissions for less frequent charging every 20100 miles phevs release fewer ghgs but hevs are more cost effective conversions of production vehiclesedit further information electric vehicle conversion conversion of fossil-fuel vehiclesedit see also calcars retrofit electrification requires only one-fifth the energy required to build a new vehicle this is called acev-to-phev conversion151 there are several companies that are converting fossil fuel non-hybrid vehicles also called all-combustion engine vehicles to plug-in hybrids152153 colorado is going

the vehicles powertrain software would be reprogrammed to make full use of the battery packs additional energy storage capacity and power output many early plug-in hybrid electric vehicle conversions have been based on the 2004 or later model toyota prius155 some of the systems have involved replacement of the vehicles original nimh battery pack and its electronic control unit others such as a123 hymotion the calcars prius and the piprius piggyback an additional battery back onto the original battery pack this is also referred to as battery range extender modules brems156 within the electric vehicle conversion community this has been referred to as a hybrid battery pack configuration157 early leadacid battery conversions by calcars demonstrated 10 miles 15 km of ev-only and 20 miles 30 km

created a functioning plug-in hybrid with a 40 miles 64km all-electric range and that it has solved the overheating problem that rapid acceleration can cause in phevs and extend battery life147148 the eaa-phev project was conceived by calcars and the electric auto association in october 2005 to accelerate efforts to document existing hevs and their potential for conversion into phevs160 it includes a conversion interest page161 the electric auto association-phev do-it-yourself open source communitys primary focus is to provide conversion instructions to help guide experienced converters through the process and to provide a common design that could demonstrate multiple battery technologies many members of organizations such as calcars and the eaa as well as companies like hybrids plus hybrid

hybrids as observed in testing by popular mechanics magazine providing greater all-electric range adds cost and entails compromises so different all-electric ranges may suit different customers needs with the exception of tesla motors demand for all-electric vehicles especially in the us market has been driven by government incentivescitation needed in particular american sales of the nissan leaf have depended on generous incentives and special treatment in the state of georgia the top selling leaf market166 according to international market research 60 of respondents believe a battery driving range of less than 160km 99mi is unacceptable even though only 2 drive more than that distance per day167 among popular current all-electric vehicles only the tesla with the most expensive version of the model s offering a 265 miles 426km range in the us environmental protection agency 5-cycle test significantly exceeds this threshold the nissan leaf has an epa rated range of 75 miles 121km for the 2013 model year plug-in hybrids provide the extended range and potential for refueling of conventional hybrids while enabling drivers to utilize battery electric power for at least a significant part of their typical daily driving the average trip to or from work in the united states in 2009 was 11.8 miles 19.0km,168 while the average distance commuted to work in england and wales in 2011 was slightly lower at 9.3 miles 15km.169 since building a phev with a longer all-electric range adds weight and cost and reduces cargo andor passenger space there is not a specific all-electric range that is optimal the accompanying graph shows the observed all-electric range in miles for four popular us market plug-in hybrids as tested by popular mechanics magazine170 a key design parameter of the chevrolet volt was a target of 40 miles 64km for the all-electric range selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs and mainly because research showed that 78 of daily commuters in the us travel 40mi 64km or less this target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight this requirement translated using a lithium-ion battery pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 kwh considering that the battery would be used until the state of charge soc of the battery reached 30.171172 in october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system since volt deliveries began and with over 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled that volt owners drive about 62.5 of their trips in all-electric mode173 in may 2016 ford reported based on data collected from more than 610 million miles 976 million km logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system that drivers of these vehicles run an average of 13,500 miles 21,700km annually on their vehicles with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode a break down of these figures show an average daily commute of 42mi 68km for ford energi plug-in hybrid drivers ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model the average fusion energi commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline if the car is fully charged both before leaving for work and before leaving for home according to ford data currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home174 the 2015 edition of the epas annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends estimates the following utility factors for 2015 model year plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver whether in electric only or blended modes 83 for the bmw i3 rex 66 for the chevrolet volt 45 for the ford energi models 43 for the mclaren p1 37 for the bmw i8 and 29 for the toyota prius phv175 a 2014 analysis conducted by the idaho national laboratory using a sample of 21,600 all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids found that volt owners traveled on average 9,112 miles in all-electric mode e-miles per year while leaf owners traveled 9,697 e-miles per year despite the volts shorter all-electric range about half of the leafs176 between january and august 2014 a period during which us sales of conventional hybrids slowed us sales of plug-in hybrids grew from 28,241 to 40,748 compared to the same period in 2013 us sales of all-electric vehicles also grew during the same period from 29,917 vehicles in the january to august 2013 period to 40,349 in

2013 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and environmental protection agency epa issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity as phevs can operate in two or three operating modes all-electric blended and gasoline-only182183 one label is for series hybrid or extended range electric vehicle like the chevy volt with all-electric and gasoline-only modes and a second label for blended mode or series-parallel hybrid that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation and gasoline only like a conventional hybrid vehicle182183 rechargeit charging stations available in the garage designated for converted plug-in hybrids at googles mountain view campus a further advantage of phevs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the phevs internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency while a prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30 efficiency well below the engines 38 peak efficiency the engine of a phev-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency131 the actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation inversion battery chargingdischarging the motor controller and motor itself the way a vehicle is used its duty cycle and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid the society of automotive engineers sae developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address phevs an sae committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of phevs184 the toronto atmospheric fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008 which was considered below the technologys potential185 phev batteries also allow for an additional efficiency when converting solar power directly into a dc storage system as opposed to converting the energy into ac home or building dc to dc direct conversion is more efficient therefore potentially allowing the more efficient capture of solar energy186 in real world testing using normal drivers some prius phev conversions may not achieve much better fuel economy

plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs of various electric ranges 10 20 30 and 40 miles with conventional gasoline vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles hevs for different payback periods considering different charging infrastructure deployment levels and gasoline prices the study concluded that224 phevs save around 60 or 40 in energy costs compared with conventional gasoline vehicles and hevs respectively however for drivers with significant daily vehicle miles traveled dvmt hybrid vehicles may be even a better choice than plug-in hybrids with a range of 40mi 64km particularly when there is lack of public charging infrastructure the incremental battery cost of large-battery plug-in hybrids is difficult to justify based on the incremental savings of phevs operating costs unless a subsidy is offered for large-battery phevs when the price of gasoline increases from us4 per gallon to us5 per gallon the number of drivers who benefit from a larger battery increases significantly if the gas price is us3 a plug-in hybrid with a range of 10mi 16km is the least costly option even if the battery cost is 200kw although quick chargers can reduce charging time they contribute little to energy cost savings for phevs as opposed to level-2 chargers range anxiety eliminationedit former president george w bush is shown the phev mercedes-benz sprinter van in the us postal service see also range anxiety one of the main barriers for the general adoption of all-electric cars is the range anxiety factor the drivers fear of being stranded by a depleted battery before reaching the final destination225226 plug-in hybrids as opposed to pure electric cars eliminate the range anxiety concerns because the gasoline engine serves as a back-up to recharge the battery to provide electric power to the electric motor or to provide propulsion directly access to a regular fuel station guarantees that a phev has similar driving ranges as conventional gasoline-powered automobile225227 as of 2016update there are five plug-in hybrids in the european market capable of driving around 50km 31mi under nedc cycle on the battery alone the audi a3 e-tron mitsubishi outlander p-hev volkswagen golf

option costs an additional us3850 in the united states231 4,710 us6300 in france232 and 4,490 us6000 in the netherlands233 the range-extender option of the bmw i3 was designed to meet the california air resources board carb regulation for an auxiliary power unit apu called rex according to rules adopted in march 2012 by carb the 2014 bmw i3 with a rex unit fitted will be the first car to qualify

which maintains battery charge at about 30 after the pack has been depleted in normal use is strictly limited in the additional range it can provide234 according to bmw at the beginning of the i3 release the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected more than 60 over time it has decreased significantly with some people almost never using it and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5 of i3s235 in early october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system that volt owners in north america have accumulated a

the share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer and lower in the winter the average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60 of the total distance in ev mode in the summer and 53 in winter the estimate for work trips is higher at 70 in the summer and 59 in winter238 one of the advantages of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction unlike a conventional engine which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times high-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for pev use these include advanced close-cycle steam engines stirling engines wankel engines and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small sizecitation needed smogedit the ontario medical association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in its province every year239 plug-in hybrids in emission-free electric mode may contribute to the reduction of smog185 vehicle-to-grid electricityedit main article vehicle-to-grid phevs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time this assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods ie at night or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads this is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology by using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure23 in the uk vtg would need to comply with generation connection standard g592 which means that it would need an earth rod at the premises and would be unable to export more than 17kw without the network firms permission which feeding onto one phase ie for a normal house would not be given - to maintain a balance of load across the three phases in october 2005 five toyota engineers and one asian aw engineer published an ieee technical paper detailing a toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a toyota prius240 although the technical paper described a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the ths-ii toyota hybrid system to add a function for generating electricity it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit as well however the vehicle was featured in a toyota dream house and a brochure for the exhibit stated that the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid241 us president barack obama examines hybrid vehicles in the edison electric vehicle technical center in pomona california in november 2005 more than 50 leaders from public power utility companies across the united states met at the los angeles department of water and power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technology the event which was sponsored by the american public power association also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology greg hanssen and peter nortman of energycs and edrive attended the two-day session and during a break in the proceedings made an impromptu display in the ladwp parking lot of their converted prius plug-in hybrid242 in september 2006 the california air resources board held a zero emission vehicle symposium that included several presentations on v2g technology243 in april 2007 pacific gas and electric company showcased a phev at the silicon valley leadership alternative energy solutions summit with vehicle-to-grid capability and demonstrated that it could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure244 regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible245 jon wellinghoff from the us federal energy regulatory commission coined the term cash-back hybrids to describe payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting or by donation including maintenance to the car owners by the public utilities in a vehicle-to-grid agreement246 disadvantagesedit cost of batteriesedit main article electric vehicle battery disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost weight and size of a larger battery pack according to a 2010 study by the national research council the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack is about us1700kwh of usable energy and considering that a phev-10 requires about 2.0kwh and a phev-40 about 8kwh the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a phev-10 is around us3000 and it goes up to us14000 for a phev-40247248 according to the same study even though costs are expected to decline by 35 by 2020 market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore phevs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030 unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occurs247248249 cost comparison between a phev-10 and a phev-40247249 prices for 2010 plug-in type by ev range similar production model type of drivetrain manufacturer additional cost compared to

with a larger battery pack the prius plug-in estimated all-electric range is 14.5mi 23km250 2 assuming 15,000 miles per year according to the 2010 nrc study although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins high upfront costs and it will take decades before the break even point is achieved249 furthermore hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the us248249 a 2013 study by the american council for an energy-efficient economy reported that battery costs came down from us1300 per kilowatt hour in 2007 to us500 per kilowatt hour in 2012 the us department of energy has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of us300 per kilowatt hour in 2015 and us125 per kilowatt hour by 2022 cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles251 a study published in 2011 by the belfer center harvard university found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices this finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the us market and assuming no government subidies252253 according to the study estimates a phev-40 is us5377 more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine while a battery electric vehicle bev is us4819 more expensive the study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase under the future scenarios considered the study found that bevs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars us1155 to us7181 cheaper while phevs will be more expensive than bevs in almost all comparison scenarios and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices bevs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel while phevs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines252 lithium iron phosphate batteries from valence technologies254 were used in the first plug-in hybrids from calcars255 they are providing a conversion for the toyota prius priced at us12000 hymotion also offers a conversion for us10000 but their conversion is only 5kw where oemteks is 9kw.256 recharging outside home garagesedit main article charging station rechargeit converted plug-in hybrids at googles mountain view campus the garage has recharging facilities powered by solar panels three plug-in converted toyota prius recharging at san francisco city hall public charging station on-street electric charging unit located at the hillsboro civic center in hillsboro oregon many authors have assumed that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at home however residents of cities apartments dormitories and townhouses might not have garages or driveways with available power outlets and they might be less likely to buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is developed257258 electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence or in commercial or public parking lots or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of phevs258259 even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers260261 however this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors259 several cities in california and oregon and particularly san francisco and other cities in the san francisco bay area and silicon valley as well as some local private firms such as google and adobe systems already have deployed charging stations and have expansion plans to attend both plug-ins and all-electric cars259 in googles case its mountain view campus has 100 available charging stations for its share-use fleet of converted plug-ins available to its employees259262 solar panels are used to generate the electricity and this pilot program is being monitored on a daily basis with performance results published on the rechargeit website262 emissions shifted to electric plantsedit increased pollution is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of phevs but most areas will experience a decrease263 a study by the aceee predicts that widespread phev use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid264 although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity the net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid fossil or renewable for example and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves identifying regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plantor replacing a plant altogethermay also be more practical from a human health perspective shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage265 according to a 2009 study by the national academy of science electric vehicles and grid-dependent plug-in hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologies266 efficiency of plug-in hybrids is also impacted by the overall efficiency of electric power transmission transmission and distribution losses in the usa were estimated at 7.2 in 1995267 and 6.5 in 2007.268 by life cycle analysis of air pollution emissions natural gas vehicles are currently the lowest emittercitation needed tiered rate structure for electric billsedit electric utility companies generally do not utilize flat rate pricing for example pacific gas and electric pge normally charges 0.10 per kilowatt hour kwh for the base tier but additional tiers are priced as high as 0.30 per kwh to customers without electric vehicles269270 some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate tariff that provides discounts for off-peak usage such as overnight recharging pge offers a special discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers the experimental time-of-use low emission vehicle rate271 that tariff gives people much cheaper rates if they charge at night especially during the summer months the additional electrical utilization required to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits272 without an off-peak charging tariff one study of a certain phev-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7migal us and all-electric efficiency of 4mikwh found that household electricity customers who consumed 131200 of baseline electricity at 0.220kwh would see benefits if gasoline was priced above us289us gal those that consumed 201300 of baseline electricity at 0.303kwh would only see benefits if gas was priced above 3.98 and households consuming over 300 of baseline electricity at 0.346kwh would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above 4.55 usdgal273 off-peak tariff rates can lower the break-even point the pge tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to us196 3.17 and 3.80 per gallon respectively for the given phev and usage pattern in question customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged for example by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours thus an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation the salar de uyuni in bolivia is one of the largest known lithium reserves in the world274275 lithium availability and supply securityedit see also lithium and rare earth metals availability and supply security current technology for plug-ins is based on the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor and the demand for lithium heavy metals and other rare elements such as neodymium boron and cobalt required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long term some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism unstable governments or hostile to us interests raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials275276277278 even though the metals used in electric vehicle batteries are rare they can be recycled279 fossil fuels are finite and nonrenewable280 currently the main deposits of lithium are found in china and south america throughout the andes mountain chain in 2008 chile was the leading lithium metal producer followed by australia china and argentina277281 in the united states lithium is recovered from brine pools in nevada281282 nearly half the worlds known reserves are located in bolivia275277 and according to the us geological survey bolivias salar de uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium which can be used to make lithium batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles275281 other important reserves are located in chile china and brazil277281 regarding rare earth elements most reserves are located in china which controls the world market for these elements278 hazard to pedestriansedit see also electric vehicle warning sounds at low speeds electric-drive cars produced less roadway noise as compared to vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets hence plug-in electric cars and hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard283284 tests have shown that this is a valid concern as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below 20mph 30kmh for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired at higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise284 the government of japan the us congress and the european parliament passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles when operating in electric mode so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching284285286287 as of march 2013update most of the hybrids and plug-in electric cars available in the united states make warning noises using a speaker system288 greenhouse gas emissionsedit see also greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in electric vehicles the effect of phevs on greenhouse emissions is complex plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power the clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants289 in the same way phevs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power but from the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation from the perspective of a full life cycle analysis the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind solar hydroelectric or nuclear power for pevs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions289290 on the other hand when pevs are recharged from coal-fired plants they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles289 in the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy290 there has been much debate over the potential ghg emissions reductions that can be achieved with phev a study by the electric power research institute reports that a 338 twh or 5.8 increase in power generation needed as a result of phev291 in the same report the epri also states that co2 emissions could increase by 430 million metric tons291 the article concludes in summary the addition of phevs as a significant transportation option adds approximately 6 to the total national electricity demand in 2030 compared to the base case with no phevs due to the charging profile that results in most of this additional demand occurring during off-peak hours late nightearly morning there is an increase in the need for baseload generation the addition of coal-fired generation to meet this need for more baseload generation does not result in any significant differences in annual emissions of so2 nox and hg because of the caps on those pollutants therefore any reductions in emissions of so2 nox or hg from non-electric generating sources would result in a net national decline in these emissions however it does result in an appreciable increase in co2 and pm emissions as this analysis has not assumed any limits on co2 or pm emissions a study by the american council for an energy efficient economy aceee predicts that on average a typical american driver is expected to achieve about a 15 reduction in net co 2 emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the us electrical grid292 the aceee study also predicts that in areas where more than 80 of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants local net co 2 emissions will increase292 while for phevs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower co 2 emissions than the current average net co 2 emissions associated with phevs will decrease correspondingly a 2007 joint study by the electric power research institute epri and the natural resources defense council nrdc similarly found that the introduction of phevs into americas consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions4 the epri-nrdc report estimates that between 2010 and 2050 a shift toward phev use could reduce ghg emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons the magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of phev market penetration and the carbon intensity of the us electricity sector in general phevs can be viewed as an element in the pacala and socolow wedges approach which shows a way to stabilize co 2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques including efficient vehicles a 2008 study at duke university suggests that for phevs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than hybrids a carbon pricing signal that encourages the development of low carbon power is needed293 rand also in 2008 studied the questions of a carbon tax carbon cap and trade systems increasing gasoline tax and providing renewable energy subsidies under various economic conditions and vehicle type availabilities rand found that subsidies were able to provide a smoother transition to new energy sources especially in the face of energy source price volatility because subsidies can be structured according to relative costs between renewables and fossil fuel while taxes and carbon trading schemes alone do not take relative prices of energy into account294 the minnesota pollution control agency found that if minnesotas fleet of vehicles making lengthy trips were replaced by plug-in hybrids co 2 emissions per vehicle would likely decrease however unless more than 40 of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in co 2 emissions295 plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips which is how most vehicles are used the difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-ins263 a study by kantor fowler hajimiragha and elkamel shows that fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles achieve twice as much reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than phevs and fcvs the study uses the transportation sector in ontario canada as a case study with the maximum allowable number of vehicles being that which can be supported by the electric grid296 argonne national laboratoryedit in 2009 researchers at argonne national laboratory adapted their greet model to conduct a full well-to-wheels wtw analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batteries three us regions were selected for the analysis california new york and illinois as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes the full cycle analysis results were also reported for the us generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes respectively5 this 2009 study showed a wide spread of petroleum use and ghg emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixes the following table summarizes the main results5 phev well-to-wheels petroleum energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for an all-electric range between 10 and 40 miles 16 and 64km with different on-board fuels1 as a relative to an internal combustion engine vehicle that uses fossil fuel gasoline analysis reformulated

analysis for bio-mass fuel feedstocks297298 the argonne study found that phevs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles more petroleum energy savings and also more ghg emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation as expected electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and ghg emissions for all phevs as the all-electric range increased the study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels biomass-e85 and -hydrogen may not realize ghg emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources5 oak ridge national laboratoryedit a 2008 study by researchers at oak ridge national laboratory analyzed oil use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrids relative to hybrid electric vehicles under several scenarios for years 2020 and 2030 each type of vehicle was assumed to run 20 miles 32km per day and the hev was assumed to have a fuel economy of 40 miles per us gallon 5.9l100km 48mpg-imp.299 the study considered the mix of power sources for 13 us regions generally a combination of coal natural gas and nuclear energy and to a lesser extend renewable energy299300 a 2010 study conducted at argonne national laboratory reached similar findings concluding that phevs will reduce oil consumption but could produce very different greenhouse gas emissions for each region depending on the energy mix used to generate the electricity to recharge the plug-in hybrids301302 the following table summarizes the main results of the oak ridge national laboratory study for the 2020 scenario comparison

the us environmental protection agency published the 2014 edition of its annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends for the first time the report presents an analysis of the impact of alternative fuel vehicles with emphasis in plug-in electric vehicles because as their market share is approaching 1 pevs began to have a measurable impact on the us overall new vehicle fuel economy and co2 emissions199304 epas report included the analysis of 12 all-electric passengers cars and 10 plug-in hybrids available in the market as model year 2014 for purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between those phevs like the chevrolet volt that can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline and those that operate in a blended mode like the toyota prius phv which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode in addition since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection on average of the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity in electric only and blended modes by an average driver the following table shows the overall evhybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e and the utility factor for the ten my2014 plug-in hybrids available in the us market the study used the utility factor since in pure ev mode there are no tailpipe emissions and the epa best estimate of the co2 tailpipe emissions produced by these vehicles in real world city and highway operation based on the epa 5-cycle label methodology using a weighted 55 city45 highway driving the results are shown in the following table199 in addition the epa accounted for the upstream co2 emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the phevs since electricity production in the united states varies significantly from region to region the epa considered three scenariosranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the california powerplant emissions factor the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the rockies the epa estimates that the electricity ghg emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346

across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day the former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day306307 an analysis by three economist affiliated with the national bureau of economic research nber published in november 2014 developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the united states the study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009 and used the specifications for the chevrolet volt all-electric range of 35mi 56km the analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the upper midwest compared to the western us and within regions rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others307 applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles the nber researchers found that the emissions of charging pevs vary by region and hours of the day in some regions such as the western us and texas co2 emissions per mile from driving pevs are less than those from driving a hybrid car however in other regions such as the upper midwest charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 am implies that pevs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road the results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions this occurs because coal-fired units which have higher emission rates are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand while natural gas units which have relatively low emissions rates are often brought online to meet peak demand this pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening307 production and salesedit see also sales and main markets for plug-in electric vehicles and list of modern production plug-in electric vehicles production modelsedit launched in
