kilometers miles etc divided by total energy input kilowatt-hour amount of gasoline etc this is more precisely known as fuel economy symbol fe and may be measured in units of kml or migal mpg12 energy efficiency in transportation is often and confusingly described in terms of fuel consumption symbol fc fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy2 and is occasionally known as energy intensity3 it equals fuel energy divided by distance and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers l100km joules per kilometer jkm gallon-equivalent per 100 miles gale100mi or kilowatt-hours per distance kw-hrkm or kw-hrmi the energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation listed below different types of transportation range from some hundred

much less efficient56 walkingedit nordic walkers a 68kg 150lb person walking at 4kmh 2.5mph requires approximately 210 kilocalories 880kj of food energy per hour which is equivalent to 4.55kmmj.7 1usgal 3.8l of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units 120mj8 of energy so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon 0.65l100km velomobileedit main article velomobile velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation at a speed of 50kmh 31mph the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5kwh of food energy per 100km to transport the passenger which is around 15 20 of a normal bicycle and 150 2 of an average fossil fuel or electric car this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon 2000kml 0.05l100km.9 other sources give a figure of 13.4 29.5 of the energy use of a normal bicycle10 bicyclingedit a chinese flying pigeon bicycle a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport compared with walking a 64kg 140lb cyclist riding at 16kmh 10mph requires about half the food energy per unit distance 43kcalmi 27kcalkm or 3.1kwh 11mj per 100km.7 this converts to about 732mpg-us 0.321l100km 879mpg-imp.11 this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance a motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49cm3 3.0cuin engine giving a range of 160to 200mpg-us 1.51.2l100km 190240mpg-imp.citation needed electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0kwh 3.6mj per 100km,citation needed while maintaining speeds in excess of 30kmh 19mph.citation needed these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70 of the work with around 3.6mj 1.0kwh per 100km coming from the motor human poweredit to be thorough a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing transporting and packaging of fuel food or fossil fuel the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment while automobiles for example require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans in addition any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 automobilesedit main article fuel economy in automobiles see also fuel economy-maximizing behaviors bugatti veyron automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres l100km but in some countries including the usa uk and india it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed kml or miles per us or imperial gallon this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel the oak ridge national laboratory ornl states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit btu per us gallon 32mjl compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon 36.4mjl for diesel12 a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy bio-fuels electricity and hydrogen for instance have significant energy inputs in their production because of this the 5070 efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency13 a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger we can compare for instance the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area14 to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58.15 finally vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span in other words vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem compare for example walking which requires no special equipment at all and an automobile produced in and shipped from another country and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again and used for a limited number of years driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15.1617 example consumption figuresedit two american solar cars in canada solar cars use no fuel charging the batteries entirely from built-in solar panels and typically use

consumption in aircraft is drag which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress drag is proportional to the lift required for flight29 which is equal to the weight of the aircraft as induced drag increases with weight mass reduction with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in aerodynamic drag has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1 weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75 reduction in fuel consumption29 flight altitude affects engine efficiency jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause the temperature minimum of the atmosphere at lower temperatures the carnot efficiency is higher29 jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds but above about mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster compressibility effects beginning at transonic speeds of around mach 0.85 shockwaves form increasing drag for supersonic flight it is difficult to achieve a lift to drag ratio greater than 5 and fuel consumption is increased in proportion concorde fuel efficiency comparison assuming jets are filled to capacity aircraft concorde30 boeing 747-40031

were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case32 most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile33 between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4 concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l100km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon34 air france airbus a380-800 the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption3536 there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption37 winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircrafts wing drag and can be retrofitted to any airplane37 nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500lb 230kg blended wing aircraft this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings38 the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over todays more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs3940 nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect41 aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450mph 700kmh.42 this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current needs update high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engineairframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans43 nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate small aircraftedit dynaro mcr4s motor-gliders made of composite materials can reach an extremely low fuel

power requires no input energy in terms of fuel however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion such as cooking heating or lighting the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine the speed at which it travels and its displacement due to the high viscosity of water with a single passenger the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car train or plane trainsedit trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply for electrified systems5051 and importantly

to return current into the catenary while they brake a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6 of the total energy consumed the passenger rail urban and intercity and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements final report states that commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops and that we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent of total energy consumed by commuter railways65 having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20 of the energy wasted in braking weight is a determinant of braking losses other referencesedit aea study of road and rail for the united kingdom department for transport final report busesedit the bus rapid transit of metz uses a diesel-electric hybrid

loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines moreover due to their walk on ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers as a consequence the overall load factor on uk railways is 35 or 90 people per train71 conversely air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are pre-book in nature using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 7090 however recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques with loads reaching typically 71 overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the
