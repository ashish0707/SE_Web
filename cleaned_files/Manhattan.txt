francis i of france was the first european to visit the area that would become new york city he entered the tidal strait now known as the narrows aboard his ship la dauphine and named the land around upper new york harbor new angoulme in reference to the family name of king francis i that was derived from angoulme in france he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the hudson river which he referred to in his report to the french king as a very big river and he named the bay of santa margarita what is now upper new york bay after marguerite de navarre the elder sister of the king3637 it was not until the voyage of henry hudson an englishman who worked for the dutch east india company that the area was mapped38 hudson came across manhattan island and the native people living there in

manhattan on may 24 1626 from unnamed native american people which are believed to have been canarsee indians of the lenape44 in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders15 often said to be worth

battles in the early american revolutionary war the continental army was forced to abandon manhattan after the battle of fort washington on november 16 1776 the city greatly damaged by the great fire of new york during the campaign became the british political and military center of operations in north america for the remainder of the war54 british occupation lasted until november 25 1783 when george washington returned to manhattan as the last british forces left the city55 from january 11 1785 to the fall of 1788 new york city was the fifth of five capitals of the united states under the articles of confederation with the continental congress meeting at new york city hall then at fraunces tavern new york was the first capital under the newly enacted constitution of the united states from march 4 1789 to august 12 1790 at federal hall56 federal hall was also the site of where the united states supreme court met for the first time57 the united states bill of rights were drafted and ratified58 and where the northwest ordinance was adopted establishing measures for adding new states to the union59 19th centuryedit manhattan in 1873 the brooklyn bridge was under construction from 1870 until 1883 new york grew as an economic center first as a result of alexander hamiltons policies and practices as the first secretary of the treasury and later with the opening of the erie canal in 1825 which connected the atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the midwestern united states and canada6061 by 1810 new york city then confined to manhattan had surpassed philadelphia as the largest city in the united states62 tammany hall a democratic party political machine began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant irish culminating in the election of the first tammany mayor fernando wood in 1854 tammany hall dominated local politics for decades central park which opened to the public in 1858 became the first landscaped public park in an american cityb new york city played a complex role in the american civil war the citys strong commercial ties to the american south64 its growing immigrant population prior to then largely from germany and ireland beginning in the late 1850s waves of italian and central and eastern european jews began flowing in en-masse anger about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to pay 300 to avoid service led to resentment against lincolns war policies plus the racial element fomented paranoia about free blacks taking the poor immigrants jobs65 culminated in the three-day-long new york draft riots of july 1863 these intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in american history with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred66 the rate of immigration from europe grew steeply after the civil war and new york became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the united states a role acknowledged by the dedication of the statue of liberty on october 28 1886 a gift from the people of france6768 the new european immigration brought further social upheaval in a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations the city was a hotbed of revolution including anarchists and communists among others syndicalism racketeering and unionization in 1883 the opening of the brooklyn bridge established a road connection to brooklyn across the east river in 1874 the western portion of the present bronx county was transferred to new york county from westchester county and in 1895 the remainder of the present bronx county was annexed69 in 1898 when new york city consolidated with three neighboring counties to form the city of greater new york manhattan and the bronx though still one county were established as two separate boroughs on january 1 1914 the new york state legislature created bronx county and new york county was reduced to its present boundaries70 the sanitary topographical map of the city

1911 the triangle shirtwaist factory fire in greenwich village killed 146 garment workers the disaster eventually led to overhauls of the citys fire department building codes and workplace regulations73 the period between the world wars saw the election of reformist mayor fiorello la guardia and the fall of tammany hall after 80 years of political dominance74 as the citys demographics stabilized labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class the citys government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under la guardia despite the great depression some of the worlds tallest skyscrapers were completed in manhattan during the 1930s including numerous art deco masterpieces that are still part of the citys skyline today most notably the empire state building the chrysler building and the ge building victory over japan day in times square 1945 returning world war ii veterans created a postwar economic boom which led to the development

morning hours of june 28 1969 at the stonewall inn in the greenwich village neighborhood of lower manhattan they are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for lgbt rights in the united states7778 in the 1970s job losses due to industrial restructuring caused new york city including manhattan to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates79 while a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the citys economic health in the 1980s new yorks crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s.80 the 1980s saw a rebirth of wall street and manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry the 1980s also saw manhattan at

hudson shoreline at greenwich street to west street99 when building the world trade center in 1968 1.2million cubic yards 917,000m of material was excavated from the site100 rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills the fill material was used to expand the manhattan shoreline across west street creating battery park city101 the result was a 700-foot 210-m extension into the river running six blocks or 1,484 feet 452m covering 92acres 37ha providing a 1.2-mile 1.9km riverfront esplanade and over 30acres 12ha of parks102 marble hilledit one neighborhood of new york county is

of manhattan as an island between the bronx and the remainder of manhattan103 before world war i the section of the original harlem river channel separating marble hill from the bronx was filled in and marble hill became part of the mainland104 marble hill is one example of how manhattans land has been considerably altered by human intervention the borough has seen substantial land reclamation

outcrops of manhattan schist occur and rat rock is one rather large example106107108 geologically a predominant feature of the substrata of manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near midtown manhattan dips down lower between 29th street and canal street then rises toward the surface again in lower manhattan it has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the midtown and financial district areas and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas109110 however research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers111112113 updated seismic analysisedit according to the united states geological survey an updated analysis of seismic hazard in july 2014 revealed a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings in manhattan than previously assessed scientists estimated this lessened risk
