the steam and hot water for healing purposes and cooking1 when euroamericans first entered the area six indian tribes inhabited the area around the geysers three bands of pomo people two bands of wappo people and the lake miwok people1 the wappo also collected sulfur which they called teke and a wappo village named tekenantsonoma teke sulphur nan well containing water tso ground noma village was located about 12 miles 19km southeast of cloverdale and on the present-day sulphur creek1 the geysers were first seen by euroamericans and named in 1847 during john fremonts survey of the sierra mountains and the great basin by william bell elliot who called the area the geysers although the geothermal features he discovered were not technically geysers but fumaroles2 between 1848 and 1854,1 archibald c godwin developed the geysers into a spa named the geysers resort hotel which attracted tourists including ulysses s grant theodore roosevelt and mark twain23 the resort declined in popularity in the mid 1880s and rebranded itself to appeal to lower-income people1 in 1938 the main building was destroyed in a landslide although the barrestaurant small cabins and the swimming pool stayed open despite another fire in march 1957 until about 1979.1 unocal corporation dismantled the remains of the resort in 1980.1 five of the geysers facilities were damaged in the valley fire of september 2015 suffering severe damage to their cooling towers the main power houses were not damaged4 geothermal developmentedit drilling a geothermal well 1977 usgs the geysers is the worlds largest geothermal field5 spanning an area of around 30 square miles 78km2 in sonoma lake and mendocino counties in california centered in the area of geyser canyon and cobb mountain power from the geysers provides electricity to sonoma lake mendocino marin and napa counties it is estimated that the development meets 60 of the power demand for the coastal region between the golden gate bridge and the oregon state line6 unlike most geothermal resources the geysers is a dry steam field which mainly produces superheated steam5 steam used at the geysers is produced from a greywacke sandstone reservoir capped by a heterogeneous mix of low permeability rocks and underlaid by a silicic intrusion27 gravity and seismic studies suggest that the source of heat for the steam reservoir is a large magma chamber over 4 miles 6.4km beneath the surface and greater than 8 miles 13km in diameter8 the first geothermal wells drilled in geyser canyon were the first in the western hemisphere1 the first power plant at the geysers was privately developed by the owner of the geysers resort1 and opened in 1921 producing 250 kilowatts of energy to light the resort2 in 1960 pacific gas and electric began operation of their 11-megawatt plant at the geysers9 the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11mw net power10 by 1999 the steam to power extraction had begun to deplete the geysers steam field and production began to drop2 however since october 16 1997 the geysers steam field has been recharged by injection of treated sewage effluent producing approximately 77 megawatts of capacity in 2004.11 the effluent is piped up to 50 miles 80km from its source at the lake county sanitation waste water treatment plants and added to the geysers steam field via geothermal injection11 in 2004 85 of the effluent produced by four waste-water treatment plants serving 10 lake county communities was diverted to the geysers steam field11 injecting treated water into the geysers field increases the amount of power that can be generated11 the injection of wastewater to the geysers protects local waterways and clear lake by diverting effluent which used to be put into surface waters11 and has produced electricity without releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere2 seismicityedit according to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory earth sciences division seismicity was very low prior to the use of the geyser steam field for geothermal energy although this may have been the result of low seismic coverage of the area12 before 1969 there were no earthquakes above magnitude 2 recorded by the united states geological survey usgs in an approximately 70 square miles 180km2 area around the geysers12 studies have shown that injecting water into the geysers field produces earthquakes from magnitude 0.5 to 3.0 although a 4.6 occurred in 1973 and magnitude four events increased thereafter12 even with increasing injection rates over time the rate of magnitude 3 earthquakes has remained relatively unchanged since the 1980s,12 although the amount of earthquakes has increased significantly2 a magnitude 4.5 earthquake struck near the geysers on january 12 2014.13 despite the increases in the number of earthquakes and the fears of local residents it is unlikely that a large earthquake will occur at the geysers since there is no large earthquake fault or fracture nearby2 geochemistryedit in 2005 abatement equipment was installed at two of the geysers plants to reduce the amount of mercury released by the waste vapor even though the amount released was below the legal limit for such releases5 the geysers air monitoring programs gamp has shown limited releases of arsenic but again below a significant level5 productionedit power plants at the geysers are of the dry steam power plant type where the steam directly powers the generator5 in general the geysers has 1517 mw14 of active installed capacity with an average production factor of 63 955mw.15 of nearly two dozen active plants in the geysers in 2013 calpine corporation operated 19 plants in 200416 but only 15 in 2013.17 two other plants are owned jointly by the northern california power agency and the city of santa claras municipal electric utility now called silicon valley power the bottle rock power plant owned by the us renewables group was reopened in 2007.18 in july 2009 altarock energy planned to drill more than 2 miles 3.2km down to create an enhanced geothermal project which was abandoned when federal agencies asked for review2 another plant was under development by ram power corporation formerly western geopower in 2010 but after ram power lost both its ceo and cfo in 2013 it was seeking a buyer for its geysers property19 see alsoedit
