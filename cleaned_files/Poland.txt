the early middle ages reconstruction of a bronze age lusatian culture settlement in biskupin c 700 bc historians have postulated that throughout late antiquity many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now poland the ethnicity and linguistic affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated the time and route of the original settlement of slavic peoples in these regions lacks written records and can only be defined as fragmented27 the most famous archaeological find from the prehistory and protohistory of poland is the biskupin fortified settlement now reconstructed as an open-air museum dating from the lusatian culture of the early iron age around 700 bc the slavic groups who would form poland migrated to these areas in the second half of the 5th century ad up until the creation of mieszkos state and his subsequent conversion to christianity in 966 ad the main religion of slavic tribes that inhabited the geographical area of present-day poland was slavic

subjects the bulk of the population converted in the course of the next few centuries in 1000 boleslaw the brave continuing the policy of his father mieszko held a congress of gniezno and created the metropolis of gniezno and the dioceses of krakw koobrzeg and wrocaw however the pagan unrest led to the transfer of the capital to krakw in 1038 by casimir i the restorer29 earliest known contemporary

son casimir iii reigned 133370 has a reputation as one of the greatest polish kings and gained wide recognition for improving the countrys infrastructure3233 he also extended royal protection to jews and encouraged their immigration to poland3234 casimir iii realized that the nation needed a class of educated people especially lawyers who could codify the countrys laws and administer the courts and offices his efforts to create an institution of higher learning in poland were finally rewarded when pope urban v granted him permission to open the university of krakw casimir iii the great is the only polish king to receive the title of great he built extensively during his reign and reformed the polish army along with the countrys civil and criminal laws 133370 the golden liberty of the

beginning with the lithuanian grand duke jogaila wadysaw ii jagieo the jagiellon dynasty 13861572 formed the polishlithuanian union the partnership brought vast lithuania-controlled rus areas into polands sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the poles and lithuanians who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in europe for the next four centuries in the baltic sea region polands struggle with the teutonic knights continued and culminated in the battle of grunwald 1410 where a combined polish-lithuanian army inflicted a decisive victory against the teutonic knights allowing for territorial expansion of both nations into the far north region of livonia37 in 1466 after the thirteen years war king casimir iv jagiellon gave royal consent to the peace of thorn which created the future duchy of prussia a polish vassal the jagiellon dynasty at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of bohemia 1471 onwards and hungary3839 in the south poland confronted the ottoman empire and the crimean tatars by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569,40 and in the east helped lithuania fight the grand

kings from 1038 until the capital was moved to warsaw in 1596 the royal residence is an example of early renaissance architecture in poland poland was developing as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful landed nobility the nihil novi act adopted by the polish sejm parliament in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power from the monarch to the sejm an event which marked the beginning of the period known as golden liberty when the state was ruled by the free and equal polish nobility protestant reformation movements made deep inroads into polish christianity which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting religious tolerance unique in europe at that time42 this tolerance allowed the country to avoid most the religious turmoil that spread over europe during the 16th century42 the european renaissance evoked in late jagiellon poland kings sigismund i the old and sigismund ii augustus a sense of urgency in the need to promote a cultural awakening and during this period polish culture and the nations economy flourished in 1543 nicolaus copernicus a polish astronomer from toru published his epochal work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the revolutions of the celestial spheres and thus became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the heliocentric theory which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy another major figure associated with the era is the classicist poet jan kochanowski43 polishlithuanian commonwealth main articles history of poland in the early modern era 15691795 polishlithuanian commonwealth and sarmatism the warsaw confederation was an important development in the history of poland that extended religious freedoms and tolerance and is the first such document in europe 28 january 1573 the 1569 union of lublin established the polishlithuanian commonwealth a more closely unified federal state with an elective monarchy but which was governed largely by the nobility through a system of local assemblies with a central parliament the warsaw confederation 1573 confirmed the religious freedom of all residents of poland which was extremely important for the stability of the multiethnic polish society of the time31 serfdom was banned in 1588.44 the establishment of the commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in poland with the union thereafter becoming a european power and a major cultural entity occupying approximately one million square kilometers of central and eastern europe as well as an agent for the dissemination of western culture through polonization into areas of modern-day lithuania ukraine belarus and western russia in the 16th and 17th centuries poland suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the vasa kings sigismund iii and wadysaw iv and found itself engaged in major conflicts with russia sweden and the ottoman empire as well as a series of minor cossack uprisings45 in 1610 hetman stanisaw kiewski seized moscow after winning the battle of klushino the polishlithuanian commonwealth at its greatest extent after the truce of deulino 1619 from the middle of the 17th century the nobles democracy suffering from internal disorder gradually declined thus leaving the once powerful commonwealth vulnerable to foreign intervention starting in 1648 the cossack khmelnytsky uprising engulfed the south and east eventually leaving ukraine divided with the eastern part lost by the commonwealth becoming a dependency of the tsardom of russia this was followed by the deluge a swedish invasion of poland which marched through the polish heartlands and ruined the countrys population culture and infrastructure around four million of polands eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics46 however under john iii sobieski the commonwealths military prowess was re-established and in 1683 polish forces played a major role in the battle of vienna against the ottoman army commanded by kara mustafa the grand vizier of the ottoman empire king john iii sobieski defeated the ottoman turks at the battle of vienna on 12 september 1683 sobieskis reign marked the end of the nations golden-era finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy the commonwealth fell into decline the government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts eg lubomirski rebellion against john ii casimir and rebellious confederations and corrupted legislative processes the nobility fell under the control of a handful of magnats and this compounded with two relatively weak kings of the saxon wettin dynasty augustus ii and augustus iii as well as the rise of russia and prussia after the great northern war only served to worsen the commonwealths plight despite this the commonwealth-saxony personal union gave rise to the emergence of the commonwealths first reform movement and laid the foundations for the polish enlightenment47 stanisaw ii august the last king of polandacceded to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 november 1795 during the later part of the 18th century the commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education intellectual life art and especially toward the end of the period evolution of the social and political system the most populous capital city of warsaw replaced gdask danzig as the leading centre of commerce and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased age of partitions main articles history of poland 17951918 and partitions of poland the royal election of 1764 resulted in the elevation of stanisaw ii august a polish aristocrat connected to major magnate factions to the monarchy however a one-time lover of empress catherine ii of russia the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his russian sponsor this led to the formation of the 1768 bar confederation a szlachta rebellion directed against russia and the polish king that fought to preserve polands independence and the szlachtas traditional privileges attempts at reform provoked the unions neighbours and in 1772 the first partition of the commonwealth by prussia russia and austria took place an act which the partition sejm under considerable duress eventually ratified fait accompli48 disregarding this loss in 1773 the king established the commission of national education the first government education authority in europe corporal punishment of children was officially prohibited in 1783 constitution of may 3rd enactment ceremony inside the senate chamber at the warsaw royal castle 1791 the great sejm convened by stanisaw ii august in 1788 successfully adopted the 3 may constitution the first set of modern supreme national laws in europe however this document accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies generated strong opposition from the commonwealths nobles and conservatives as well as from catherine ii who determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the polish-lithuanian state russia was aided in achieving its goal when the targowica confederation an organisation of polish nobles appealed to the empress for help in may 1792 russian forces crossed the commonwealths frontier thus beginning the polish-russian war the defensive war fought by the poles ended prematurely when the king convinced of the futility of resistance capitulated and joined the targowica confederation the confederation then took over the government russia and prussia fearing the mere existence of a polish state arranged for and in 1793 executed the second partition of the commonwealth which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence eventually in 1795 following the failed kociuszko uprising the commonwealth was partitioned one last time by all three of its more powerful neighbours and with this effectively ceased to exist49 era

1795 poles rebelled several times against the partitioners particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century an unsuccessful attempt at defending polands sovereignty took place in 1794 during the kociuszko uprising where a popular and distinguished general tadeusz kosciuszko who had several years earlier served under washington in the american revolutionary war led polish insurrectionists against numerically superior russian forces despite the victory at the battle of racawice his ultimate defeat ended polands independent existence for 123 years50 in 1807 napoleon i of france temporarily recreated a polish state as the satellite duchy of warsaw after a successful greater poland uprising of 1806 against prussian rule but after the failed napoleonic wars poland was again split between the victorious powers at the congress of vienna of 1815.51 the eastern part was ruled by the russian tsar as congress poland which had a very liberal constitution however over time the russian tsar reduced polish freedoms and russia annexed the country in virtually all but name meanwhile the prussian controlled territory of poland came under increased germanization thus in the 19th century only austrian ruled galicia and particularly the free city of krakw allowed free polish culture to flourish tadeusz kociuszko takes the oath of loyalty to the polish nation in krakw vowing to fight against the military intervention of the partitioning powers 1794 throughout the period of the partitions political and cultural repression of the polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying russian prussian and austrian governments in 1830 the november uprising began in warsaw when led by lieutenant piotr wysocki young non-commissioned officers at the officer cadet school in warsaw revolted they were joined by large segments of polish society and together forced warsaws russian garrison to withdraw north of the city capture of the warsaw arsenal by the polish army during the november uprising 29 november 1830 over the course of the next seven months polish forces successfully defeated the russian armies of field marshal hans karl von diebitsch and a number of other russian commanders however finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers save distant france and the newborn united states and with prussia and austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories the poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure upon the surrender of warsaw to general ivan paskievich many polish troops feeling they could not go on withdrew into prussia and there laid down their arms after the defeat the semi-independent congress poland lost its constitution army and legislative assembly and was integrated more closely with the russian empire during the spring of nations a series of revolutions which swept across europe poles took up arms in the greater poland uprising of 1848 to resist prussian rule initially the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the prussian military was sent in to pacify the region eventually after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the prussians and the grand duchy of posen was stripped of its autonomy and completely incorporated into the german confederation in 1863 a new polish uprising against russian rule began the january uprising started out as a spontaneous protest by young poles against conscription into the imperial russian army however the insurrectionists despite being joined by high-ranking polish-lithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support they were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the russian-controlled congress poland and poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs instituted by the occupying powers which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity this was particularly true in

independence after a series of military conflicts the most notable being the polishsoviet war 191921 when poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the red army at the battle of warsaw an event which is considered to have halted the advance of communism into europe and forced vladimir lenin to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism the event is often referred to as the miracle at the vistula52 map of poland during the interwar period 191839 during this period poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state railways were restructured to direct traffic towards warsaw instead of the former imperial capitals a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a major seaport was opened on the baltic coast so as to allow polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged free city of danzig the inter-war period heralded in a new era of polish politics whilst polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the first world war the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition for this reason many exiled polish activists such as ignacy paderewski who would later become prime minister returned home to help a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures tragedy struck in 1922 when gabriel narutowicz inaugural holder of the presidency was assassinated at the zachta gallery in warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist eligiusz niewiadomski53 the

movements of the entire warc and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities which essentially functioned as an underground state complete with degree-awarding universities and a court system61 the resistance was however largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist poland for this reason in the summer of 1944 they initiated operation tempest of which the warsaw uprising that begun on 1 august 1944 was the best known operation6263 the objective of the uprising was to drive the german occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against germany and the axis powers however secondary motives for the uprising sought to see warsaw liberated before the soviets could reach the capital so as to underscore polish sovereignty by empowering the polish underground state before the soviet-backed polish committee of national liberation could assume control however a lack of available allied military aid and stalins reluctance to allow the 1st army to help their fellow countrymen take the city led to the uprisings failure and subsequent planned destruction of the city map of the holocaust in occupied poland with deportation

population in the german-occupied territories of eastern poland6768 at the wars conclusion in 1945 polands borders were shifted westwards resulting in considerable territorial losses most of the polish inhabitants of kresy were expelled along the curzon line in accordance with stalins agreements69 the western border was moved to the oder-neisse line as a result polands territory was reduced by 20 or 77,500 square kilometres 29,900sqmi the shift forced the migration of millions of other people most of whom were poles germans ukrainians and jews70 of all the countries involved in the war

formation of a new provisional pro-communist coalition government in moscow which ignored the polish government-in-exile based in london a move which angered many poles who considered it a betrayal by the allies in 1944 stalin had made guarantees to churchill and roosevelt that he would maintain polands sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place however upon achieving victory in 1945 the elections organized by the occupying soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for soviet hegemony over polish affairs the soviet union instituted a new communist government in poland analogous to much of the rest of the eastern bloc as elsewhere in communist europe the soviet occupation of poland met with armed resistance from the outset which continued into the fifties despite widespread objections the new polish government accepted the soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of poland73 in particular the cities of wilno and lww and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of red army units on polands territory military alignment within the warsaw pact throughout the cold war came about as a direct result of this change in polands

personal freedoms collectivization in the polish peoples republic failed a similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under edward gierek but most of the time persecution of anti-communist opposition groups persisted despite this poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the soviet bloc74 labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union solidarity solidarno which over time became a political force despite persecution and imposition of martial law in 1981 it eroded the dominance of the polish united workers party and by

the vistula spit in the east for the most part poland has a smooth coastline which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds this continual erosion and deposition has formed cliffs dunes and spits many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons such as ebsko lake in sowiski national park prior to the end of the second world war and subsequent change in national borders poland had only a very small coastline this was situated at the end of the polish corridor the only internationally recognised polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea however after world war ii the redrawing of polands borders and resulting shift of the countrys borders left it with an expanded coastline thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible the significance of this event and importance of it to polands future as a major industrialised nation was alluded to by the 1945 wedding to the sea the largest

its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of european cultures with origins in the culture of the proto-slavs over time polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the germanic latinate and byzantine worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in poland197 the people of poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries in the 19th and 20th centuries the polish focus on

been regarded as having a very tolerant society which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background204 this can be said to stem largely from the reign of king casimir iii
