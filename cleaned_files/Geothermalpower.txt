power generated by geothermal energy technologies in use include dry steam power stations flash steam power stations and binary cycle power stations geothermal electricity generation is currently used in 24 countries1 while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries2 as of 2015 worldwide geothermal power capacity amounts to 12.8 gigawatts gw of which 28 percent or 3,548 megawatts are installed in the united states international markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the last three years and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.517.6gw by 2020.3 based on current geologic knowledge and technology the geothermal energy association gea estimates that only 6.5 percent of total global potential has been tapped so far while the ipcc reported geothermal power potential to be in the range of 35gw to 2tw.2 countries generating more than 15 percent of their electricity from geothermal sources include el salvador kenya the philippines iceland and costa rica geothermal power is considered to be a sustainable renewable source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the earths heat content4 the greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants5 contents 1 history and

generating source prince piero ginori conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 july 1904 in larderello italy it successfully lit four light bulbs6 later in 1911 the worlds first commercial geothermal power station was built there experimental generators were built in beppu japan and the geysers california in the 1920s but italy was the worlds only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958 trends in the top five geothermal electricity-generating countries 19802012 us eia global geothermal electric capacity upper red line is installed capacity7 lower green line is realized production2 in 1958 new zealand became the second major industrial producer of geothermal electricity when its wairakei station was commissioned wairakei was the first station to use flash steam technology8 in 1960 pacific gas and electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power station in the united states at the geysers in california9 the original turbine lasted for more than 30years and produced 11mw net power10 the binary cycle power station was first demonstrated in 1967 in russia and later introduced to the usa in 1981,9 following the 1970s energy crisis and significant changes in regulatory policies this technology allows the use of much lower temperature resources than were previously recoverable in 2006 a binary cycle station in chena hot springs alaska came on-line producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57c 135f.11 geothermal electric stations have until recently been built exclusively where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface the development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range12 demonstration projects are operational in landau-pfalz germany and soultz-sous-forts france while an earlier effort in basel switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes other demonstration projects are under construction in australia the united kingdom and the united states of america13 the thermal efficiency of geothermal electric stations is low around 710,14 because geothermal fluids are at a low temperature compared with steam from boilers by the laws of thermodynamics this low temperature limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy during the generation of electricity exhaust heat is wasted unless it can be used directly and locally for example in greenhouses timber mills and district heating the efficiency of the system does not affect operational costs as it would for a coal or other fossil fuel plant but it does factor into the viability of the station in order to produce more energy than the pumps consume electricity generation requires high temperature geothermal fields and specialized heat cyclescitation needed because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy unlike for example wind or solar its capacity factor can be quite large up to 96 has been demonstrated15 however the global average capacity factor was 74.5 in 2008 according to the ipcc16

10crystallinebedrock the earths heat content is about 1031joules.2 this heat naturally flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of 44.2 terawatts tw17 and is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of 30tw.4 these power rates are more than double humanitys current energy consumption from primary sources but most of this power is too diffuse approximately 0.1 wm2 on average to be recoverable the earths crust effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits of magma water or other to release the heat underneath electricity generation requires high temperature resources that can only come from deep underground the heat must be carried to the surface by fluid circulation either through magma conduits hot springs hydrothermal circulation oil wells drilled water wells or a combination of these this circulation sometimes exists naturally where the crust is thin magma conduits bring heat close to the surface and hot springs bring the heat to the surface if no hot spring is available a well must be drilled into a hot aquifer away from tectonic plate boundaries the geothermal gradient is 2530c per kilometre km of depth in most of the world and wells would have to be several kilometres deep to permit electricity generation2 the quantity and quality of recoverable resources improves with drilling depth and proximity to tectonic plate boundaries in ground that is hot but dry or where water pressure is inadequate injected fluid can stimulate production developers bore two holes into a candidate site and fracture the rock between them with explosives or high pressure water then they pump water or liquefied carbon dioxide down one borehole and it comes up the other borehole as a gas12 this approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in europe or enhanced geothermal systems in north america much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers12 estimates of the electricity generating potential of geothermal energy vary from 35 to 2000gw depending on the scale of investments2 this does not include non-electric heat recovered by co-generation geothermal heat pumps and other direct use a 2006 report by the massachusetts institute of technology mit that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems estimated that investing 1billion usdollars in research and development over 15years would allow the creation of 100gw of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the united states alone12 the mit report estimated that over 200zettajouleszj would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over 2,000zj with technology improvements sufficient to provide all the worlds present energy needs for several millennia12 at present geothermal wells are rarely more than 3 kilometres 1.9mi deep2 upper estimates of geothermal resources assume wells as deep as 10 kilometres 6.2mi drilling near this depth is now possible in the petroleum industry although it is an expensive process the deepest research well in the world the kola superdeep borehole is 12.3km 7.6mi deep18 this record has recently been imitated by commercial oil wells such as exxons z-12 well in the chayvo field sakhalin19 wells drilled to depths greater than 4 kilometres 2.5mi generally incur drilling costs in the tens of millions of dollars20 the technological challenges are to drill wide bores at low cost and to break larger volumes of rock geothermal power is considered to be sustainable because the heat extraction is small compared to the earths heat content but extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion4 although geothermal sites are capable of providing heat for many decades individual wells may cool down or run out of water the three oldest sites at larderello wairakei and the geysers have all reduced production from their peaks it is not clear whether these stations extracted energy faster than it was replenished from greater depths or whether the aquifers supplying them are being depleted if production is reduced and water is reinjected these wells could theoretically recover their full potential such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites the long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the lardarello field in italy since 1913 at the wairakei field in new zealand since 1958,21 and at the geysers field in california since 1960.22 power station typesedit dry steam station flash steam station geothermal power stations are similar to other steam turbine thermal power stations heat from a fuel source in geothermals case the earths core is used to heat water or another working fluid the working fluid is then used to turn a turbine of a generator thereby producing electricity the fluid is then cooled and returned to the heat source dry steam power stationsedit dry steam stations are the simplest and oldest design they directly use geothermal steam of 150c or greater to turn turbines2 flash steam power stationsedit flash steam stations pull deep high-pressure hot water into lower-pressure tanks and use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines they require fluid temperatures of at least 180c usually more this is the most common type of station in operation today flash steam plants use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 360f 182 the hot water flows up through wells in the ground under its own pressure as it flows upward the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam the steam is then separated from the water and used to power a turbinegenerator any leftover water and condensed steam may be injected back into the reservoir making this a potentially sustainable resource23 24 at the geysers in california twenty years of power production had depleted the groundwater and operations were substantially reduced to restore some of the former capacity water injection was developed25 binary cycle power stationsedit main article binary cycle binary cycle power stations are the most recent development and can accept fluid temperatures as low as 57c.11 the moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a much lower boiling point than water this causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize which then drives the turbines this is the most common type of geothermal electricity station being constructed today26 both organic rankine and kalina cycles are used the thermal efficiency of this type station is typically about 1013 worldwide productionedit larderello geothermal station in italy the international geothermal association iga has reported that 10,715 megawatts mw of geothermal power in 24 countries is online which is expected to generate 67,246 gwh of electricity in 2010.1 this represents a 20 increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005 iga projected this would grow to 18,500 mw by 2015 due to the large number of projects that were under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource1 in 2010 the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power stations27 the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california28 the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with 1,904 mw of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 27 of the countrys electricity generation27 al gore said in the climate project asia pacific summit that indonesia could become a super power country in electricity production from geothermal energy29 india has announced a plan to develop the countrys first geothermal power facility in chhattisgarh30 canada is the only major country on the pacific ring of fire which has not yet developed geothermal power the region of greatest potential is the canadian cordillera stretching from british columbia to the yukon where estimates of generating output have ranged from 1,550 mw to 5,000 mw31 utility-grade stationsedit a geothermal power station in negros oriental philippines the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california united states32 as of 2004 five countries el salvador kenya the philippines iceland and costa rica generate more than 15 of their electricity from geothermal sources2 geothermal electricity is generated in the 24 countries listed in the table below during 2005 contracts were placed for an additional 500 mw of electrical capacity in the united states while there were also stations under construction in 11 other countries12

dioxide co 2 hydrogen sulfide h 2s methane ch 4 ammonia nh 3 and radon rn these pollutants contribute to global warming acid rain radiation and noxious smells if released existing geothermal electric stations that fall within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies reviewed by the ipcc produce on average 45kg of co 2 equivalent emissions per megawatt-hour of generated electricity kg co 2eqmwh for comparison a coal-fired power plant emits 1,001kg of co 2 per megawatt-hour when not coupled with carbon capture and storage ccs5 stations that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust geothermal stations could theoretically inject these gases back into the earth as a form of carbon capture and storage in addition to dissolved gases hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic chemicals such as mercury arsenic boron antimony and salt40 these chemicals come out of solution as the water cools and can cause environmental damage if released the modern practice of injecting geothermal fluids back into the earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk station construction can adversely affect land stability subsidence has occurred in the wairakei field in new zealand41 enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes due to water injection the project in basel switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the richter scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection42 the risk of geothermal drilling leading to uplift has been experienced in staufen im breisgau geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements geothermal stations use 404squaremeters pergwh versus 3,632 and 1,335squaremeters for coal facilities and wind farms respectively41 they use 20litres of freshwater per mwh versus over 1000litres permwh for nuclear coal or oil41 geothermal power stations can also disrupt the natural cycles of geysers for example the beowawe nevada geysers which were uncapped geothermal wells stopped erupting due to the development of the dual-flash station economicsedit geothermal power requires no fuel it is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations however capital costs tend to be high drilling accounts for over half the costs and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks a typical well doublet in nevada can support 4.5 megawatts mw of electricity generation and costs about 10 million to drill with a 20 failure rate20 in total electrical station construction and well drilling costs about 25million permw of electrical capacity while the levelised energy cost is 0.040.10 perkwh7 enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges with capital costs above 4million permw and levelized costs above 0.054 perkwh in 2007.43 geothermal power is highly scalable a small power station can supply a rural village though initial capital costs can be high44 the most developed geothermal field is the geysers in california in 2008 this field supported 15 stations all owned by calpine
