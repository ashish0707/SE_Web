and atomic number92 it is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table a uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons of which 6 are valence electrons uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes uranium-233 to uranium-238 varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years the most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 and uranium-235 which has 143 neutrons uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements its density is about 70 higher than that of lead and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten it occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil rock and water and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite in nature uranium is found as uranium-238 99.273999.2752 uranium-235 0.71980.7202 and a very small amount of uranium-234 0.00500.0059.4 uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle the half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years5 making them useful in dating the age of the earth many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor another fissile isotope uranium-233 can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons in sufficient concentration these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction this generates the heat in nuclear power reactors and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons depleted uranium 238u is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating6 uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass producing lemon yellow to green colors uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography the 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth who named the new element after the planet uranus eugne-melchior pligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by henri becquerel research by otto hahn lise meitner enrico fermi and others such as j robert oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in little boy the first nuclear weapon used in war an ensuing arms race during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239 the security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety7 see nuclear

white weakly radioactive metal it has a mohs hardness of 6 sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium rhodium manganese and niobium it is malleable ductile slightly paramagnetic strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor89 uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1gcm3,10 denser than lead 11.3gcm3,11 but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold 19.3gcm3.1213 uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements with an exception of the noble gases and their compounds with reactivity increasing with temperature14 hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly8 when finely divided it can react with cold water in air uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide9 uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable but not fissile on bombardment with slow neutrons its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or in special circumstances an explosion in a nuclear reactor such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison absorbing some of the free neutrons such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control as little as 15lb 7kg of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb15 the first nuclear bomb used in war little boy relied on uranium fission but the very first nuclear explosive the gadget used at trinity and the bomb that destroyed nagasaki fat man were both plutonium bombs uranium

parameter a3524pm17 applications military various militaries use depleted uranium as high-density penetrators the major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators this ammunition consists of depleted uranium du alloyed with 12 other elements such as titanium or molybdenum18 at high impact speed the density hardness and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates the use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the us uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil see gulf war syndrome15 depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials while the metal itself is radioactive its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium8 other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material9 due to its high density this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses9 depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost19 the main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity uranium being only a weak alpha emitter during the later stages of world war ii the entire cold war and to a lesser extent afterwards uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons initially two major types of fission bombs were built a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238 later a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fissionfusion bomb thermonuclear weapon was built that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile unenriched uranium case and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process20 civilian the most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in nuclear power plants the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants one kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20terajoules of energy 21013joules assuming complete fission as much energy as 1500 tonnes of coal6 commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3 uranium-2356 the candu and magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel fuel used for united states navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium-235 the exact values are classified in a breeder reactor uranium-238 can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction9 238 92u n 239 92u 239 93np 239 94pu uranium glass glowing under uv light before and occasionally after the discovery of radioactivity uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes such as uranium glass and in fiestaware21 the discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore pitchblende by marie curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials22 this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant besides the pottery glazes uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green yellow mauve black blue red and other colors uranium glass used as lead-in seals in a vacuum capacitor uranium was also used in photographic chemicals especially uranium nitrate as a toner9 in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs23 to improve the appearance of dentures24 and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense stains in transmission electron microscopy to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses isolated cell organelles and macromolecules the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element the long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 4.51109 years makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating including uranium-thorium dating uranium-lead dating and uranium-uranium dating uranium metal is used for x-ray targets in the making of high-energy x-rays9 history pre-discovery use the planet uranus which uranium is named after the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 ce when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes9 yellow glass with 1 uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples italy by r t gunther of the university of oxford in 1912.25 starting in the late middle ages pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal bohemia now jchymov in the czech republic and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry26 in the early 19th century the worlds only known sources of uranium ore were these mines discovery antoine henri becquerel discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity by exposing a photographic plate to uranium in 1896 the discovery of the element is credited to the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth while he was working in his experimental laboratory in berlin in 1789 klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound likely sodium diuranate by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide26 klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself in fact that powder was an oxide of uranium2627 he named the newly discovered element after the planet uranus named after the primordial greek god of the sky which had been discovered eight years earlier by william herschel28 in 1841 eugne-melchior pligot professor of analytical chemistry at the conservatoire national des arts et mtiers central school of arts and manufactures in paris isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium2629 henri becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896.14 becquerel made the discovery in paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt k2uo2so42 potassium uranyl sulfate on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become fogged30 he determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate fission research cubes and cuboids of uranium produced during the manhattan project a team led by enrico fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays electrons or positrons from the elements produced see beta particle31 the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94 which the dean of the faculty of rome orso mario corbino christened ausonium and hesperium respectively32333435 the experiments leading to the discovery of uraniums ability to fission break apart into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann31 in hahns laboratory in berlin lise meitner and her nephew the physicist otto robert frisch published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process nuclear fission36 soon after fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939 and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-23531 further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium which like uranium-235 is also fissile by thermal neutrons these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power on 2 december 1942 as part of the manhattan project another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction chicago pile-1 working in a lab below the stands of stagg field at the university of chicago the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons 360metric tons of graphite 58short tons 53metric tons of uranium oxide and six short tons 5.5 metric tons of uranium metal a majority of which was supplied by westinghouse lamp plant in a makeshift production process3137 nuclear weaponry the mushroom cloud over hiroshima after the dropping of the uranium-based atomic bomb nicknamed little boy two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the united states during world war ii a uranium-based device codenamed little boy whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium and a plutonium-based device see trinity test and fat man whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238 the uranium-based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945 exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500tonnes of tnt the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people see atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki30 initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world38 reactors four light bulbs lit with electricity generated from the first artificial electricity-producing nuclear reactor ebr-i 1951 the x-10 graphite reactor at oak ridge national laboratory ornl in oak ridge tennessee formerly known as the clinton pile and x-10 pile was the worlds second artificial nuclear reactor after enrico fermis chicago pile and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation argonne national laboratorys experimental breeder reactor i located at the atomic energy commissions national reactor testing station near arco idaho became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 december 1951.39 initially four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility later the town of arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by borax-iii another reactor designed and operated by argonne national laboratory4041 the worlds first commercial scale nuclear power station obninsk in the soviet union began generation with its reactor am-1 on 27 june 1954 other early nuclear power plants were calder hall in england which began generation on 17 october 1956,42 and the shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania which began on 26 may 1958 nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine the uss nautilus in 1954.3143 prehistoric naturally occurring fission main article natural nuclear fission reactor in 1972 the french physicist francis perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the oklo mine in gabon west africa collectively known as the oklo fossil reactors the ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old then uranium-235 constituted about 3 of the total uranium on earth44 this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur provided other supporting conditions exist the capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the us federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository44 contamination and the cold war legacy us and ussrrussian nuclear weapons stockpiles 19452005 above-ground nuclear tests by the soviet union and the united states in the 1950s and early 1960s and by france into the 1970s and 1980s19 spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world45 additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents46 uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer an excess risk of lung cancer among navajo uranium miners for example has been documented and linked to their occupation47 the radiation exposure compensation act a 1990 law in the usa required 100,000 in compassion payments to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments48 during the cold war between the soviet union and the united states huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium since the break-up of the soviet union in 1991 an estimated 600short tons 540metric tons of highly enriched weapons grade uranium enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the russian federation and several other former soviet states15 police in asia europe and south america on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium most of which was from ex-soviet sources15 from 1993 to 2005 the material protection control and accounting program operated by the federal government of the united states spent approximately us 550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in russia15 this money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities scientific american reported in february 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair according to an interview from the article one facility had been storing samples of enriched weapons grade uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box49 occurrence biotic and abiotic main article uranium in the environment uraninite also known as pitchblende is the most common ore mined to extract uranium the evolution of earths radiogenic heat flow over time contribution from 235u in red and from 238u in green uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock soil and water uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the earths crust uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is almost always found combined with other elements9 along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron it is only naturally formed in supernovae50 the decay of uranium thorium and potassium-40 in the earths mantle is thought to be the main source of heat5152 that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection which in turn drives plate tectonics uraniums average concentration in the earths crust is depending on the reference 2 to 4 parts per million819 or about 40 times as abundant as silver14 the earths crust from the surface to 25km 15mi down is calculated to contain 1017kg 21017lb of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013kg 21013lb.8 the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion19 uranium is more plentiful than antimony tin cadmium mercury or silver and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum919 uranium is found in hundreds of minerals including uraninite the most common uranium ore carnotite autunite uranophane torbernite and coffinite9 significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits and minerals such as lignite and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores9 it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1 uranium14 citrobacter species can have concentrations of uranium in their bodies 300 times the level of the surrounding environment some bacteria such as shewanella putrefaciens geobacter metallireducens and some strains of burkholderia fungorum use uranium for their growth and convert uvi to uiv5354 some organisms such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment55 citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate or other similar organic phosphates after one day one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water2656 the proteobacterium geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water57 the mycorrhizal fungus glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant58 in nature uraniumvi forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline ph this leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards however it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline ph a sphingomonas sp strain bsar-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase phok that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions the precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing phok protein in e coli59 plants absorb some uranium from soil dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million26 dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat26 production and mining main article uranium mining world uranium production mines and demand60 yellowcake is a concentrated mixture of uranium oxides that is further refined to extract pure uranium worldwide production of u3o8 yellowcake in 2013 amounted to 70,015 tonnes of which 22,451 t 32 was mined in kazakhstan other important uranium mining countries are canada 9,331 t australia 6,350 t niger 4,518 t namibia 4,323 t and russia 3,135 t60 uranium ore is mined in several ways by open pit underground in-situ leaching and borehole mining see uranium mining6 low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25 uranium oxides extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore61 high-grade ores found in athabasca basin deposits in saskatchewan canada can contain up to 23 uranium oxides on average62 uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali the leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation solvent extraction and ion exchange the resulting mixture called yellowcake contains at least 75 uranium oxides u3o8 yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion63 commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals9 uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of kuf 5 or uf 4 dissolved in molten calcium chloride cacl 2 and sodium chloride nacl solution9 very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament9 resources and reserves it is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at us59 per lb of uranium64 while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction65 prices went from about 10lb in may 2003 to 138lb in july 2007 this has caused a big increase in spending on exploration64 with us200 million being spent worldwide in 2005 a 54 increase on the previous year65 this trend continued through 2006 when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over 774 million an increase of over 250 compared to 2004 the oecd nuclear energy agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.64 australia has 31 of the worlds known uranium ore reserves66 and the worlds largest single uranium deposit located at the olympic dam mine in south australia67 there is a significant reserve of uranium in bakouma a sub-prefecture in the prefecture of mbomou in central african republic some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled68 such as from the megatons to megawatts program an additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible6970 there have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water71 but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water in 2012 ornl researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed hicap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water according to results verified by researchers at pacific northwest national laboratory7273 supplies this section needs to be updated please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information september 2016 main article uranium market monthly uranium spot price in us per pound the 2007 price peak is clearly visible74 in 2005 seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides with canada 27.9 of world production and australia 22.8 being the largest producers and kazakhstan 10.5 russia 8.0 namibia 7.5 niger 7.4 uzbekistan 5.5 the united states 2.5 argentina 2.1 ukraine 1.9 and china 1.7 also producing significant amounts75 kazakhstan continues to increase production and may have become the worlds largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes compared to canada with 11,100t and australia with 9,430t.7677 in the late 1960s un geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in somalia the find was the largest of its kind with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25 of the worlds then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons78 the ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years65 although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century79 uranium deposits seem to be log-normal distributed there is a 300-fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade80 in other words there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available compounds reactions of uranium metal oxidation states and oxides oxides triuranium octoxide left and uranium dioxide right are the two most common uranium oxides calcined uranium yellowcake as produced in many large mills contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber uranium content is usually referenced to u 3o 8 which dates to the days of the manhattan project when u 3o 8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard phase relationships in the uranium-oxygen system are complex the most important oxidation states of uranium are uraniumiv and uraniumvi and their two corresponding oxides are respectively uranium dioxide uo 2 and uranium trioxide uo 3.81 other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide uo diuranium pentoxide u 2o 5 and uranium peroxide uo 42h 2o also exist the most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide u 3o 8 and uo 2.82 both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions triuranium octoxide is depending on conditions the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel82 at ambient temperatures uo 2 will gradually convert to u 3o 8 because of their stability uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal82 aqueous chemistry uranium in its oxidation states iii iv v vi salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water-soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions the most common ionic forms are u3 brown-red u4 green uo 2 unstable and uo2 2 yellow for uiii uiv uv and uvi respectively83 a few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uraniumii but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state ions of u3 liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable the uo2 2 ion represents the uraniumvi state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate uo2 2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate83 unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide cationic forms the uranates salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion are generally not water-soluble carbonates the interactions of carbonate anions with uraniumvi cause the pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water uranium carbonates are often soluble in water this is because a uvi cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes pourbaix diagrams84 uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium eg perchloric acidsodium hydroxide84 uranium in carbonate solution relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium eg perchloric acidsodium hydroxide84 relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in an aqueous carbonate solution84 effects of ph the uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further when the ph of a uraniumvi solution increases the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high phs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex when carbonate is added uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the ph is increased one effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the ph range 6 to 8 a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels hydrides carbides and nitrides uranium metal heated to 250 to 300c 482 to 572f reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide nitride and halide compounds85 two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist an form that is obtained at low temperatures and a form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250c.85 uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids react with water and can ignite in air to form u 3o 8.85 carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide uc uranium dicarbide uc 2 and diuranium tricarbide u 2c 3 both uc and uc 2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures stable below 1800c u 2c 3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of uc and uc 2 to mechanical stress86 uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride un uranium dinitride un 2 and diuranium trinitride u 2n 3.86 halides uranium hexafluoride is the feedstock used to separate uranium-235 from natural uranium all uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride uf 4 uf 4 itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide85 reduction of uf 4 with hydrogen at 1000c produces uranium trifluoride uf 3 under the right conditions of temperature and pressure the reaction of solid uf 4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf 6 can form the intermediate fluorides of u 2f 9 u 4f 17 and uf 5.85 at room temperatures uf 6 has a high vapor pressure making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process85 uo 2 4 hf uf 4 2 h 2o 500c endothermic uf 4 f 2 uf 6 350c endothermic the resulting uf 6 a white solid is highly reactive by fluorination easily sublimes emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist85 one method of preparing uranium tetrachloride ucl 4 is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride the reduction of ucl 4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride ucl 3 while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine85 all uranium chlorides react with water and air bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of respectively bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding uh 3 to those elements acids85 known examples include ubr 3 ubr 4 ui 3 and ui 4 uranium oxyhalides are water-soluble and include uo 2f 2 uocl 2 uo 2cl 2 and uo 2br 2 stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the atomic weight of the component halide increases85 isotopes natural concentrations main article isotopes of uranium natural uranium consists of three major isotopes uranium-238 99.28 natural abundance uranium-235 0.71 and uranium-234 0.0054 all three are radioactive emitting alpha particles with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission rather than alpha emission there are also five other trace isotopes uranium-239 which is formed when 238u undergoes spontaneous fission releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238u atom uranium-237 which is formed when 238u captures a neutron but emits two more which then decays to neptunium-237 and finally uranium-233 which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237 it is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay which would produce uranium-232 but this has not yet been observed experimentally87 uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium with a half-life of about 4.468109 years roughly the age of the earth uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13108 years and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48105 years88 for natural uranium about 49 of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238u atom and also 49 by 234u since the latter is formed from the former and about 2.0 of them by the 235u when the earth was young probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235 but the percentage of 234u was probably much lower than this uranium-238 is usually an emitter occasionally it undergoes spontaneous fission decaying through the uranium series of nuclear decay which has 18 members into lead-206 by a variety of different decay paths14 the decay series of 235u which is called the actinium series has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-20714 the constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating uranium-234 which is a member of the uranium series decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes uranium-233 is made from thorium-232 by neutron bombardment usually in a nuclear reactor and 233u is also fissile9 its decay series ends at bismuth-209 and thallium-205 uranium-235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is fissile this means that it can be split into two or three fragments fission products by thermal neutrons14 uranium-238 is not fissile but is a fertile isotope because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium-239 another fissile isotope indeed the 238u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium-239 239u decays by beta emission to neptunium-239 also a beta-emitter that decays in its turn within a few days into plutonium-239 239pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the trinity test on 15 july 1945 in new mexico31 enrichment main article enriched uranium cascades of gas centrifuges are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes in nature uranium is found as uranium-238 99.2742 and uranium-235 0.7204 isotope separation concentrates enriches the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction the concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a critical mass to be considered enriched the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3 and 5.89 this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238 called depleted uranium or du to be considered depleted the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3.90 the price of uranium has risen since 2001 so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35 uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above 130 per kilogram in july 2007 from 5 in 2001.90 the gas centrifuge process where gaseous uranium hexafluoride uf 6 is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using high-speed centrifuges is the cheapest and leading enrichment process30 the gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the manhattan project in this process uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-23530 the molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine this leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution6 an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation avlis and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers91 another method used is liquid thermal diffusion8 human exposure a person can be exposed to uranium or its radioactive daughters such as radon by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food the amount of uranium in air is usually very small however people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used or live or work near a coal-fired power plant facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel may have increased exposure to uranium9293 houses or structures that are over uranium deposits either natural or man-made slag deposits may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas the occupational safety and health administration osha has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mgm3 over an 8-hour workday the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit rel of 0.2mgm3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mgm3 at levels of 10mgm3 uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health94 most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion only 0.5 is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium such as its oxide are ingested whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5.26 however soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body whereas insoluble uranium compounds especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs pose a more serious exposure hazard after entering the bloodstream the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uraniums affinity for phosphates26 uranium is not absorbed through the skin and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions which accumulate in bone liver kidney and reproductive tissues uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces95 and aquifers96 effects and precautions normal functioning of the kidney brain liver heart and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because besides being weakly radioactive uranium is a toxic metal269798 uranium is also a reproductive toxicant99100 radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation the primary form of 238u decay has a very short range and will not penetrate skin uranyl uo2 2 ions such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals101 while the cdc has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium102 exposure to uranium and its decay products especially radon are widely known and significant health threats19 exposure to strontium-90 iodine-131 and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons103 although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself104 finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature9 uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution105 uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it105 compilation of 2004 review on uranium toxicity97 body system human studies animal studies in vitro renal elevated levels of protein
