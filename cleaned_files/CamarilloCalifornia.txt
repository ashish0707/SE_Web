villages along the pacific coast near the mouths of the calleguas creek and santa clara river artifacts from their settlements are on display in the ventura county historical museum and their paintings are still visible on canyon walls and in caves in the area54 european explorationedit the portuguese navigator juan rodrguez cabrillo while exploring the pacific coast for the king of spain came upon the chumash in an area near point mugu he explored the surrounding region and claimed it in the name of spain in 1542 cabrillo was followed in 1602 by sebastian viscaino on a mapping expedition for the king of spain the chumash continued to inhabit the coast until 1768 when russians having established a settlement 800 miles 1,300km to the north launched expeditions challenging the spanish land claims in the 18th century the spanish began settling california and built the first of what would become a chain of 21 missions in san diego father junpero serra establish the ninth mission in ventura in 1782 bringing more settlers to the area and exposing the indians who had settled around the mission to many european diseases to which they had no immunity their numbers diminished until the chumash once the largest indian nation in california had largely vanished by 1839.citation needed mexican independenceedit by the early 1820s mexico had gained independence from spain and shortly afterward california allied itself with mexico the mexican land grant system was liberalized in 1824 resulting in many large grants in california and the proliferation of ranchos north of the border one grant to jos pedro ruiz created rancho calleguas in 1837 in the area that is now camarillo the grant was later sold to juan camarillo who had arrived in 1834 as a member of the hijar-padres expedition55 it was his sons adolfo and juan that are credited with the founding of the town that was to bear their name the earlier proposed name of calleguas was rejected as too difficult to pronounce springvilleedit at about same time the town of springville had begun to form just to the west of the emerging town of camarillo on the main road to ventura which is now the

the adjoining streets were 250 with few buyers travel to and from los angeles was difficult owing to the narrow tortuous road climbing the conejo grade to the east of the citycitation needed one of the farm fields in southern camarillo the main industry during this period was agriculture and the area surrounding the small town was blanketed with orange lemon and walnut groves the state mental hospital south of the town was the largest employer a few houses had sprung up to the north and south of town center the oxnard army air field built during world war ii to the west of town the navy facility at point mugu and the seabee base at port hueneme brought many military personnel to the area but there was little private industry or other source of non-agricultural employment oxnard aaf

ventura freeway us route 101edit in the mid-1950s the ventura freeway which bisects the town was completed from los angeles to points north making it an easy one-hour trip to camarillo the freeway was originally planned to follow the path of potrero road south of camarillo which would have completely by-passed the soon-to-be city however after much debate city officials persuaded caltrans to lay the freeway parallel to ventura boulevard creating the infamously steep descent from the santa monica mountains known as the conejo grade the grade is about 2.7 miles 4.3km and posted as a 7 gradewhich translates as about one thousand feet of elevation change in less than three miles 70 meters per kilometer there is a california highway patrol brake inspection station at the top of the grade and a stop is mandatory for all 18-wheel trucks the completion of the freeway facilitated the growth that followed in 1962 the population was 7,500 and 3m began construction for the mincom and magnetic tape divisions which would ultimately employ 900 people becoming the largest local employer that plant briefly housed a factory for 3m spinoff imation before being closed in 2008.63 housing

miles 3.2km from the city center on the road to point mugu and the first shopping center and supermarket were under construction because of the late date of city incorporation the local telephone exchange is still listed as part of oxnard much of the city was expected to be developed to the south of ventura blvd however it was to the north that the new city grew and the land south of ventura blvd remains reserved for agricultural use to this daycitation needed many of the home buyers during the 1960s were military veterans who had been stationed at one of the local bases during their service the temperate climate and the living conditions lured them back with the establishment of both the pacific missile range at nas point mugu and the naval civil engineering laboratory at port hueneme many found employment that utilized their military training other newcomers were those who worked and lived in the san fernando valley and were willing to endure the commute for the opportunity to raise their families in a smog-free semirural environment still others relocated here with their employers like 3m and harbor freight tools who built facilities in and around the city
