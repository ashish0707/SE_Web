assembly of the core of experimental breeder reactor i in idaho united states 1951 a breeder reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates more fissile material than it consumes1 these devices achieve this because their neutron economy is high enough to breed more fissile fuel than they use from fertile material such as uranium-238 or thorium-232 breeders were at first found attractive because their fuel economy was better than light water reactors but interest declined after the 1960s as more uranium reserves were found2 and new methods of uranium enrichment reduced fuel costs contents 1

by a factor of 100 compared to widely used once-through light water reactors which extract less than 1 of the energy in the uranium mined from the earth8 the high fuel efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply or energy used in mining adherents claim that with seawater uranium extraction there would be enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy our energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983s total energy consumption rate thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy910 nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s in broad terms spent nuclear fuel has two main components the first consists of fission products the leftover fragments of fuel atoms after they have been split to release energy fission products come in dozens of elements and hundreds of isotopes all of them lighter than uranium the second main component of spent fuel is transuranics atoms heavier than uranium which are generated from uranium or heavier atoms in the fuel when they absorb neutrons but do not undergo fission all transuranic isotopes fall within the actinide series on the periodic table and so they are frequently referred to as the actinides the physical behavior of the fission products is markedly different from that of the transuranics in particular fission products do not themselves undergo fission and therefore cannot be used for nuclear weapons furthermore only seven long-lived fission product isotopes have half-lives longer than a hundred years which makes their geological storage or disposal less problematic than for transuranic materials11 with increased concerns about nuclear waste breeding fuel cycles became interesting again because they can reduce actinide wastes particularly plutonium and minor actinides12 breeder reactors are designed to fission the actinide wastes as fuel and thus convert them to more fission products after spent nuclear fuel is removed from a light water reactor it undergoes a complex decay profile as each nuclide decays at a different rate due to a physical oddity referenced below there is a large gap in the decay half-lives of fission products compared to transuranic isotopes if the transuranics are left in the spent fuel after 1,000 to 100,000 years the slow decay of these transuranics would generate most of the radioactivity in that spent fuel thus removing the transuranics from the waste eliminates much of the long-term radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel13 todays commercial light water reactors do breed some new fissile material mostly in the form of plutonium because commercial reactors were never designed as breeders they do not convert enough uranium-238 into plutonium to replace the uranium-235 consumed nonetheless at least one-third of the power produced by commercial nuclear reactors comes from fission of plutonium generated within the fuel14 even with this level of plutonium consumption light water reactors consume only part of the plutonium and minor actinides they produce and nonfissile isotopes of plutonium build up along with significant quantities of other minor actinides15 conversion ratio breakeven breeding ratio doubling time and burnupedit one measure of a reactors performance is the conversion ratio the average number of new fissile atoms created per fission event all proposed nuclear reactors except specially designed and operated actinide burners16 experience some degree of conversion as long as there is any amount of a fertile material within the neutron flux of the reactor some new fissile material is always created the ratio of new fissile material in spent fuel to fissile material consumed from the fresh fuel is known as the conversion ratio or breeding ratio of a reactor for example commonly used light water reactors have a conversion ratio of approximately 0.6 pressurized heavy water reactors phwr running on natural uranium have a conversion ratio of 0.8.17 in a breeder reactor the conversion ratio is higher than 1 breakeven is achieved when the conversion ratio becomes 1 the reactor produces as much fissile material as it uses doubling time is the amount of time it would take for a breeder reactor to produce enough new fissile material to create a starting fuel load for another nuclear reactor this was considered an important measure of breeder performance in early years when uranium was thought to be scarce however since uranium is more abundant than thought and given the amount of plutonium available in spent reactor fuel doubling time has become a less important metric in modern breeder reactor design1819 burnup is a measure of how much energy has been extracted from a given mass of heavy metal in fuel often expressed for power reactors in terms of gigawatt-days per ton of heavy metal burnup is an important factor in determining the types and abundances of isotopes produced by a fission reactor breeder reactors by design have extremely high burnup compared to a conventional reactor as breeder reactors produce much more of their waste in the form of fission products while most or all of the actinides are meant to be fissioned and destroyed20 in the past breeder reactor development focused on reactors with low breeding ratios from 1.01 for the shippingport reactor2122 running on thorium fuel and cooled by conventional light water to over 1.2 for the soviet bn-350 liquid-metal-cooled reactor23 theoretical models of breeders with liquid sodium coolant flowing through tubes inside fuel elements tube-in-shell construction suggest breeding ratios of at least 1.8 are possible on an industrial scale24 the soviet br-1 test reactor achieved a breeding ratio of 2.5 under non-commercial conditions25 types of breeder reactoredit production of heavy transuranic actinides in current thermal-neutron fission reactors through neutron capture and decays starting at uranium-238 isotopes of plutonium americium and curium are all produced in a fast neutron breeder reactor all these isotopes may be burned as fuel many types of breeder reactor are possible a breeder is simply a reactor designed for very high neutron economy with an associated conversion rate higher than 1.0 in principle almost any reactor design could possibly be tweaked to become a breeder an example of this process is the evolution of the light water reactor a very heavily moderated thermal design into the super fast reactor 26 concept using light water in an extremely low-density supercritical form to increase the neutron economy high enough to allow breeding aside from water cooled there are many other types of breeder reactor currently envisioned as possible these include molten-salt cooled gas cooled and liquid metal cooled designs in many variations almost any of these basic design types may be fueled by uranium plutonium many minor actinides or thorium and they may be designed for many different goals such as creating more fissile fuel long-term steady-state operation or active burning of nuclear wastes for convenience it is perhaps simplest to divide the extant reactor designs into two broad categories based upon their neutron spectrum which has the natural effect of dividing the reactor designs into those designed to use primarily uranium and transuranics and those designed to use thorium and avoid transuranics fast breeder reactor or fbr uses fast unmoderated neutrons to breed fissile plutonium and possibly higher transuranics from fertile uranium-238 the fast spectrum is flexible enough that it can also breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium if desired thermal breeder reactor use thermal spectrum moderated neutrons to breed fissile uranium-233 from thorium thorium fuel cycle due to the behavior of the various nuclear fuels a thermal breeder is thought commercially feasible only with thorium fuel which avoids the buildup of the heavier transuranics reprocessingedit fission of the nuclear fuel in any reactor produces neutron-absorbing fission products because of this unavoidable physical process it is necessary to reprocess the fertile material from a breeder reactor to remove those neutron poisons this step is required if one is to fully utilize the ability to breed as much or more fuel than is consumed all reprocessing can present a proliferation concern since it extracts weapons usable material from spent fuel27 the most common reprocessing technique purex presents a particular concern since it was expressly designed to separate pure plutonium early proposals for the breeder reactor fuel cycle posed an even greater proliferation concern because they would use purex to separate plutonium in a highly attractive isotopic form for use in nuclear weapons2829 several countries are developing reprocessing methods that do not separate the plutonium from the other actinides for instance the non-water based pyrometallurgical electrowinning process when used to reprocess fuel from an integral fast reactor leaves large amounts of radioactive actinides in the reactor fuel8 more conventional advanced water-based reprocessing systems like purex include sanex unex diamex coex and truexas well as proposals to combine purex with co-processes all these systems have better proliferation resistance than purex though their adoption rate is low3031 in the thorium cycle thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233 which then decays to uranium-233 if the protactinium remains in the reactor small amounts of u-232 are also produced which has the strong gamma emitter tl-208 in its decay chain similar to uranium-fueled designs the longer the fuel and fertile material remain in the reactor the more of these undesirable elements build up inside the envisioned commercial thorium reactors high levels of u232 would be allowed to accumulate leading to extremely high gamma radiation doses from any uranium derived from thorium these gamma rays complicate the safe handling of a weapon and the design of its electronics this explains why u-233 has never been pursued for weapons beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations32 waste reductionedit

product nuclear waste became a greater concern by the 1990s breeding fuel cycles attracted renewed interest because of their potential to reduce actinide wastes particularly plutonium and minor actinides12 since breeder reactors on a closed fuel cycle would use nearly all of the actinides fed into them as fuel their fuel requirements would be reduced by a factor of about 100 the volume of waste they generate would be reduced by a factor of about 100 as well while there is a huge reduction in the volume of waste from a breeder reactor the activity of the waste is about the same as that produced by a light water reactor38 in addition the waste from a breeder reactor has a different decay behavior because it is made up of different materials breeder reactor waste is mostly fission products while light water reactor waste has a large quantity of transuranics after spent nuclear fuel has been removed from a light water reactor for longer than 100,000 years these transuranics would be the main source of radioactivity eliminating them would eliminate much of the long-term radioactivity from the spent fuel13 in principle breeder fuel cycles can recycle and consume all actinides9 leaving only fission products as the graphic in this section indicates fission products have a peculiar gap in their aggregate half-lives such that no fission products have a half-life longer than 91 years and shorter than two hundred thousand years as a result of this physical oddity after several hundred years in storage the activity of the radioactive waste from a fast breeder reactor would quickly drop to the low level of the long-lived fission products however to obtain this benefit requires the highly efficient separation of transuranics from spent fuel if the fuel reprocessing methods used leave a large fraction of the transuranics in the final waste stream this advantage would be greatly reduced8 both types of breeding cycles can reduce actinide wastes the fast breeder reactors fast neutrons can fission actinide nuclei with even numbers of both protons and neutrons such nuclei usually lack the low-speed thermal neutron resonances of fissile fuels used in lwrs39 the thorium fuel cycle inherently produces lower levels of heavy actinides the fertile material in the thorium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 232 while the fertile material in the uranium fuel cycle has an atomic weight of 238 that mass difference means that thorium-232 requires six more neutron capture events per nucleus before the transuranic elements can be produced in addition to this simple mass difference the reactor gets two chances to fission the nuclei as the mass increases first as the effective fuel nuclei u233 and as it absorbs two more neutrons again as the fuel nuclei u2354041 a reactor whose main purpose is to destroy actinides rather than increasing fissile fuel stocks is sometimes known as a burner reactor both breeding and burning depend on good neutron economy and many designs can do either breeding designs surround the core by a breeding blanket of fertile material waste burners surround the core with non-fertile wastes to be destroyed some designs add neutron reflectors or absorbers16 breeder reactor conceptsedit there are several concepts for breeder reactors the two main ones are reactors with a fast neutron spectrum are called fast breeder reactors fbr these typically utilize uranium-238 as fuel reactors with a thermal neutron spectrum are called thermal breeder reactors these typically utilize thorium-232 as fuel fast breeder reactoredit schematic diagram showing the difference between the loop and pool types of lmfbr in 2006 all large-scale fast breeder reactor fbr power stations were liquid metal fast breeder reactors lmfbr cooled by liquid sodium these have been of one of two designs1 loop type in which the primary coolant is circulated through primary heat exchangers outside the reactor tank but inside the biological shield due to radioactive sodium-24 in the primary coolant experimental breeder reactor ii which served as the prototype for the integral fast reactor pool type in which the primary heat exchangers and pumps are immersed in the reactor tank all current fast neutron reactor designs use liquid metal as the primary coolant to transfer heat from the core to steam used to power the electricity generating turbines fbrs have been built cooled by liquid metals other than sodiumsome early fbrs used mercury other experimental reactors have used a sodium-potassium alloy called nak both have the advantage that they are liquids at room temperature which is convenient for experimental rigs but less important for pilot or full scale power stations lead and lead-bismuth alloy have also been used the relative merits of lead vs sodium are discussed here looking further ahead four of the proposed generation iv reactor types are fbrs42 gas-cooled fast reactor gfr cooled by helium sodium-cooled fast reactor sfr based on the existing liquid metal fbr lmfbr and integral fast reactor designs lead-cooled fast reactor lfr based on soviet naval propulsion units supercritical water reactor scwr based on existing lwr and supercritical boiler technology fbrs usually use a mixed oxide fuel core of up to 20 plutonium dioxide puo2 and at least 80 uranium dioxide uo2 another fuel option is metal alloys typically a blend of uranium plutonium and zirconium used because it is transparent to neutrons enriched uranium can also be used on its own many designs surround the core in a blanket of tubes that contain non-fissile uranium-238 which by capturing fast neutrons from the reaction in the core converts to fissile plutonium-239 as is some of the uranium in the core which is then reprocessed and used as nuclear fuel other fbr designs rely on the geometry of the fuel itself which also contains uranium-238 arranged to attain sufficient fast neutron capture the plutonium-239 or the fissile uranium-235 fission cross-section is much smaller in a fast spectrum than in a thermal spectrum as is the ratio between the 239pu235u fission cross-section and the 238u absorption cross-section this increases the concentration of 239pu235u needed to sustain a chain reaction as well as the ratio of breeding to fission16 on the other hand a fast reactor needs no moderator to slow down the neutrons at all taking advantage of the fast neutrons producing a greater number of neutrons per fission than slow neutrons for this reason ordinary liquid water being a moderator as well as a neutron absorber is an undesirable primary coolant for fast reactors because large amounts of water in the core are required to cool the reactor the yield of neutrons and therefore breeding of 239pu are strongly affected theoretical work has been done on reduced moderation water reactors which may have a sufficiently fast spectrum to provide a breeding ratio slightly over 1 this would likely result in an unacceptable power derating and high costs in an liquid-water-cooled reactor but the supercritical water coolant of the scwr has sufficient heat capacity to allow adequate cooling with less water making a fast-spectrum water-cooled reactor a practical possibility26 the only commercially operating reactor as of 2015update is the bn-600 reactor in russia a 560mw sodium cooled reactor integral fast reactoredit one design of fast neutron reactor specifically designed to address the waste disposal and plutonium issues was the integral fast reactor also known as an integral fast breeder reactor although the original reactor was designed to not breed a net surplus of fissile material4344 to solve the waste disposal problem the ifr had an on-site electrowinning fuel reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium and all the transuranics not just plutonium via electroplating leaving just short half-life fission products in the waste some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository where they would not have to be stored for anywhere near as long as wastes containing long half-life transuranics the ifr pyroprocessing system uses molten cadmium cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly on-site at the reactor45 such systems not only commingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium they are compact and self-contained so that no plutonium-containing material ever needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with breeding ratios very close to 1.00 so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium andor plutonium fuel the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium metal a quantity of natural uranium metal equivalent to a block about the size of a milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1gigawatt reactor would need46 such self-contained breeders are currently envisioned as the final self-contained and self-supporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers816 the project was canceled in 1994 by united states secretary of energy hazel oleary4748 other fast reactorsedit the graphite core of the molten salt reactor experiment another proposed fast reactor is a fast molten salt reactor in which the molten salts moderating properties are insignificant this is typically achieved by replacing the light metal fluorides eg lif bef2 in the salt carrier with heavier metal chlorides eg kcl rbcl zrcl4 several prototype fbrs have been built ranging in electrical output from a few light bulbs equivalent ebr-i 1951 to over 1,000mwe as of 2006 the technology is not economically competitive to thermal reactor technologybut india japan china south korea and russia are all committing substantial research funds to further development of fast breeder reactors anticipating that rising uranium prices will change this in the long term germany in contrast abandoned the technology due to safety concerns the snr-300 fast breeder reactor was finished after 19 years despite cost overruns summing up to a total of 3.6 billion euros only to then be abandoned49 as well as their thermal breeder program india is also developing fbr technology using both uranium and thorium feedstocks thermal breeder reactoredit the shippingport reactor used as a prototype light water breeder for five years beginning in august 1977 the advanced heavy water reactor ahwr is one of the few proposed large-scale uses of thorium50 india is developing this technology their interest motivated by substantial thorium reserves almost a third of the worlds thorium reserves are in india which also lacks significant uranium reserves the third and final core of the shippingport atomic power station 60mwe reactor was a light water thorium breeder which began operating in 1977.51 it used pellets made of thorium dioxide and uranium-233 oxide initially the u-233 content of the pellets was 56 in the seed region 1.53 in the blanket region and none in the reflector region it operated at 236mwt generating 60mwe and ultimately produced over 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity after five years the core was removed and found to contain nearly 1.4 more fissile material than when it was installed demonstrating that breeding from thorium had occurred5253 the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr is also planned as a thorium thermal breeder liquid-fluoride reactors may have attractive features such as inherent safety no need to manufacture fuel rods and possibly simpler reprocessing of the liquid fuel this concept was first investigated at the oak ridge national laboratory molten-salt reactor experiment in the 1960s from 2012 it became the subject of renewed interest worldwide54 japan china the uk as well as private us czech and australian companies have expressed intent to develop and commercialize the technology breeder reactor controversyedit like many aspects of nuclear power fast breeder reactors have been subject to much controversy over the years in 2010 the international panel on fissile materials said after six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries in germany the united kingdom and the united states breeder reactor development programs have been abandoned5556 the rationale for pursuing breeder reactorssometimes explicit and sometimes implicitwas based on the following key assumptions5657 it was expected that uranium would be scarce and high-grade deposits would quickly become depleted if fission power were deployed on a large scale the reality however is that since the end of the cold war uranium has been much cheaper and more abundant than early designers expected58 it was expected that breeder reactors would quickly become economically competitive with the light-water reactors that dominate nuclear power today but the reality is that capital costs are at least 25 more than water cooled reactors it was thought that breeder reactors could be as safe and reliable as light-water reactors but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a sodium coolant where a leak could lead to a sodium fire it was expected that the proliferation risks posed by breeders and their closed fuel cycle in which plutonium would be recycled could be managed but since plutonium breeding reactors produce plutonium from u238 and thorium reactors produce fissile u233 from thorium all breeding cycles could theoretically pose proliferation risks59 there are some past anti-nuclear advocates that have become pro-nuclear power as a clean source of electricity since breeder reactors effectively recycle most of their waste this solves one of the most important negative issues of nuclear power in the documentary pandoras promise a case is made for breeder reactors because they provide a real high kw alternative to fossil fuel energy according to the movie one pound of uranium provides as much energy as 5000 barrels of oil60 fbrs have been built and operated in the united states the united kingdom france the former ussr india and japan1 the experimental fbr snr-300 was built in germany but never operated and eventually shut down amid political controversy following the chernobyl disaster as of

concerns83 an experimental lead-cooled fast reactor brest-300 will be built at the siberian chemical combine scc in seversk the brest design is seen as a successor to the bn series and the 300mwe unit

tonnes of fuel the unit would be refuelled every year with each fuel element spending five years in total within the core lead coolant temperature would be around 540c giving a high efficiency of 43 primary heat production of 700mwt yielding electrical power of 300mwe the operational lifespan of the unit could be 60 years the design is expected to be completed by nikiet in 2014 for construction between 2016 and 2020.84 construction of the bn-800 reactor on february 16 2006 the us france and japan signed an arrangement to research and develop sodium-cooled fast reactors in support of the global nuclear energy partnership85 in april 2007 the japanese government selected mitsubishi heavy industries as the core company in fbr development in japan shortly thereafter mhi started a new company mitsubishi fbr systems mfbr to develop and eventually sell fbr technology86 the marcoule nuclear site in france location of the phnix on the left and possible future site of the astrid gen-iv reactor in september 2010 the french government allocated 651.6 million euros to the commissariat lnergie atomique to finalize the design of astrid advanced sodium technological reactor for industrial demonstration a 600mw reactor design of the 4th generation to be operational in 2020.8788 as of 2013 the uk had shown interest in the prism reactor and was working in concert with france to develop astrid in october 2010 ge hitachi nuclear energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the operators of the us department of energys savannah river site which should allow the construction of a demonstration plant based on the companys s-prism fast breeder reactor prior to the design receiving full nrc licensing approval89 in october 2011 the independent reported that the uk nuclear decommissioning authority nda and senior advisers within the department for energy and climate change decc had asked for technical and financial details of the prism partly as a means of reducing the countrys plutonium stockpile90 the traveling wave reactor proposed in a patent by intellectual ventures is a fast breeder reactor designed to not need fuel reprocessing during the decades-long lifetime of the reactor the breed-burn wave in the twr design does not move from one end of the reactor to the other but gradually from the inside out moreover as the fuels composition changes through nuclear transmutation fuel rods are continually reshuffled within the core to optimize the neutron flux and fuel usage at any given point in time thus instead of letting the wave propagate through the fuel the fuel itself is moved through a largely stationary burn wave this is contrary to many media reports which have popularized the concept as a candle-like reactor with a burn region that moves down a stick of fuel by replacing a static core configuration with an actively managed standing wave or soliton core terrapowers design avoids the problem of cooling a highly variable burn region under this scenario the reconfiguration of fuel rods is accomplished remotely by robotic devices the containment vessel remains closed during the procedure and there is no associated downtime91 see
