and when to remove this template message the tongass national forest in alaska is managed by the united states forest service natural resource management refers to the management of natural resources such as land water soil plants and animals with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations stewardship natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural landscapes interact it brings together land use planning water management biodiversity conservation and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture mining tourism fisheries and forestry it recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity1 natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and ecology and the life-supporting capacity of those resources2 environmental management is also similar to natural resource management in academic contexts the sociology of natural resources is closely related to but distinct from

lands totaling approximately 264 million acres 1,070,000 km2 or one-eighth of the landmass of the country the emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of north american rangelands in the late 19th century and the resource conservation movement of the same time34 this type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist conservation strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources a more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social cultural economic and political aspects of resource management5 a more holistic national and even global form evolved from the brundtland commission and the advocacy of sustainable development in 2005 the government of new south wales established a standard for quality natural resource management6 to improve the consistency of practice based on an adaptive management approach in the united states the most active areas of natural resource management are wildlife management often associated with ecotourism and rangeland management in australia water sharing such as the murray darling basin plan and catchment management are also significant ownership regimesedit natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of stakeholders natural resources state property private property common property non-property open access hybrid state property regimeedit ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources but only at the permission of the state national forest national parks and military reservations are some us examples private property regimeedit any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owners private land is the most common example common property regimesedit it is a private property of a group the group may vary in size nature and internal structure eg indigenous neighbours of village some examples of common property are community forests non-property regimes open accessedit there is no definite owner of these properties each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish these areas are the most exploited it is said that everybodys property is nobodys property an example is a lake fishery common land may exist without ownership in which case in the uk it is vested in a local authority hybrid regimesedit many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes an example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in nsw australia where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation but where most native vegetation exists on private land7 stakeholder analysisedit stakeholder analysis originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into natural resource management in ever growing popularity stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources8 there is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder9 different approaches to who is a stakeholder9 source who is a stakeholder kind of research freeman10 can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organizations objectives business management bowie11 without whose support the organization would cease to exist business management clarkson12 persons or groups that have or claim ownership rights or interests in a corporation and its activities past present or future business management grimble and wellard13 any group of people organized or unorganized who share a common interest or stake in a particular issue or system natural resource management gass et al14 any individual group and institution who would potentially be affected whether positively or negatively by a specified event process or change natural resource management buanes et al15 any group or individual who may directly or indirectly affector be affectedplanning to be at least potential stakeholders natural resource management brugha and varvasovszky actors who have an interest in the issue under consideration who are affected by the issue or whobecause of their positionhave or could have an active or passive influence on the decision making and implementation process health policy oda16  persons groups or institutions with interests in a project or programme development therefore it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised billgrena and holme9 identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence develop an understanding of why changes occur establish who can make changes happen how to best manage natural resources this gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions917 there are numerous stakeholder theories such as mitchell et al18 however grimble17 created a framework of stages for a stakeholder analysis in natural resource management grimble17 designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management stages in stakeholder analysis17 clarify objectives of the analysis place issues in a systems context identify decision-makers and stakeholders investigate stakeholder interests and agendas investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence eg conflicts and compatibilities trade-offs and synergies application grimble and wellard13 established that stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests multiple uses and users of the resource market failure subtractability and temporal trade-offs unclear or open-access property rights untraded products and services poverty and under-representation1317 case studies in the case of the bwindi impenetrable national park a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of peoples livelihoods and loss of life1317 nepal indonesia and koreas community forestry are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources this allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests criticisms natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by clarkson stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the worlds misery19 starik20 proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder however this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues9 stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders8 identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions21 on-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions21 alternatives complementary forms of analysis social network analysis common pool resource management of the resourcesedit natural resource management issues are inherently complex they involve the ecological cycles hydrological cycles climate animals plants and geographetc all these are dynamic and inter-related a change in one of them may have far reaching andor long term impacts which may even be irreversible in addition to the natural systems natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests policies politics geographical boundaries economic implications and the list goes on it is very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time this results in conflicting situations after the united nations conference for the environment and development unced held in rio de janeiro in 1992 most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land water and forests although program names vary from nation to nation all express similar aims the various approaches applied to natural resource management include top-down command and control community-based natural resource management adaptive management precautionary approach integrated natural resource management management of the resources natural resource

resource management adaptive management precautionary approach integrated natural resource management community-based natural resource managementedit the community-based natural resource management cbnrm approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities the three key assumptions being that locals are better placed to conserve natural resources people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life5 when a local peoples quality of life is enhanced their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced22 regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of subsidiarity the united nations advocates cbnrm in the convention on biodiversity and the convention to combat desertification unless clearly defined decentralised nrm can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can eg forest communities in central kalimantan indonesia23 a problem of cbnrm is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation24 the concept and conflicting interests of cbnrm2526 show how the motives behind the participation are differentiated as either people-centred active or participatory results that are truly empowering27 or planner-centred nominal and results in passive recipients understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based nrm locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits cbnrm is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities on the one hand and national and transnational organizations on the other to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas28 with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues employment diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity cbnrm has raised new challenges as concepts of community territory conservation and indigenous are worked into politically varied plans and programs in disparate sites warner and jones29 address strategies for effectively managing conflict in cbnrm the capacity of indigenous communities to conserve natural resources has been acknowledged by the australian government with the caring for country30 program caring for our country is an australian government initiative jointly administered by the australian government department of agriculture fisheries and forestry and the department of the environment water heritage and the arts these departments share responsibility for delivery of the australian governments environment and sustainable agriculture programs which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of natural resource management these programs have been delivered regionally through 56 state government bodies successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions31 governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management in the state of nsw the 13 catchment management authorities cmas are overseen by the natural resources commission nrc responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs32 adaptive managementedit the primary methodological approach adopted by catchment management authorities cmas for regional natural resource management in australia is adaptive management6 this approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of plan-do-review-act it also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice determination of scale collection and use of knowledge information management monitoring and evaluation risk management community engagement opportunities for collaboration6 integrated natural resource managementedit integrated natural resource management inrm is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use biophysical socio-political and economic meet production goals of producers and other direct users eg food security profitability risk aversion as well as goals of the wider community eg poverty alleviation welfare of future generations environmental conservation it focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself reducing possible future conflicts the conceptual basis of inrm has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use participatory planning integrated watershed management and adaptive management333434 inrm is being used extensively and been successful in regional and

and modellingedit there are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management geographic information systems gis gis is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links a bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall cleared land and erosion36 in australia metadata directories such as ndar provide data on australian natural resources such as vegetation fisheries soils and water37 these are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation natural resources management audit frameworks the nsw government in australia has published an audit framework38 for natural resource management to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management this audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies including performance audit environmental audit and internal audit audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public3940 the australian government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting which closely follows australian standards for assurance engagements the australian government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management focussing on the implementation of the murray darling basin plan other elementsedit biodiversity conservation the issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management what is biodiversity biodiversity is a comprehensive concept which is a description of the extent of natural diversity gaston and spicer41 p3 point out that biodiversity is the variety of life and relate to different kinds of biodiversity organization according to gray42 p154 the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity was put forward by the united nations in 1992 involving different aspects of biological diversity precautionary biodiversity management the threats wreaking havoc on biodiversity include habitat fragmentation putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources forest deterioration and deforestation the invasion of alien species and climate change43 p2 since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management according to cooney there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management concrete policy tools cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on evidences relating to high standard of proof the forbidding of special activities and information and monitoring requirements before making the policy of precaution categorical evidence is needed when the potential menace of activities is regarded as a critical and irreversible endangerment these activities should be forbidden for example since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment the south africa marine living resources act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to catch fish by using explosives and toxicants administration and guidelines according to cooney there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management 1 ecosystem based management including more risk-averse and precautionary management where given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure function and inter-specific interactions precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management 2 adaptive management is a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems 3 environmental impact assessment and exposure ratings decrease the uncertainties of precaution even though it has deficiencies and 4 protectionist approaches which most frequently links to biodiversity conservation in natural resources management land management in order to have a sustainable environment understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important in terms of understanding young44 emphasises some important points of land management comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem water soils using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills dale et al 200045 study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them the ecological principles relate to time place species disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many waysit is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context and the effects on natural resources plan for long-term change and unexpected events preserve rare landscape elements and associated species avoid land uses that deplete natural resources retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species avoid or compensate for the effects of development on
